# I want to setup a international team consisting of representatives (CS/Business/Marketing/Advanced Math - probably finishing university/Competing in IMO) from ch, de, ru, usa - that would like to start a business app of languages

- 70% of core I already built, it's missing finishes touches and marketing
- They would help build the rest of it and market it on international markets
- I don't have any money to offer them
- What can I offer to make it a good proposal

This is a classic startup challenge: attracting elite talent without cash. For IMO-level mathematicians and top CS students from competitive countries, you need a radically different value proposition. Here's how to frame it:

## üíé **The Core Value Proposition for Elite Talent**

### **1. Intellectual Property & Equity Structure**

```python
equity_proposal = {
    "founder": "You - 30% (for existing IP and vision)",
    "technical_cofounder": "15-20% (CS/Architecture lead)",
    "math_ai_lead": "10-15% (Algorithm optimization)",
    "regional_ambassadors": "5-10% each (CH, DE, RU, US markets)",
    "equity_pool": "20-30% for future hires/investors",
    "vesting": "4-year vesting with 1-year cliff for all"
}
```

**Pitch:** "You're not getting a job; you're getting a founding stake in what could be the next Duolingo. The 70% built IP is worth $X already - you're building on valuable groundwork."

## üí∞ **The Funding Pathway**

### **Clear Milestone-Based Plan:**

```python
funding_roadmap = {
    "month_3": "Demo with 1,000 users ‚Üí Pre-seed round ($250K)",
    "month_6": "10,000 users ‚Üí Seed round ($1-2M)",
    "month_12": "100,000 users ‚Üí Series A ($5-10M)",
    "exit_optionality": ["Acquisition by edtech giant", "IPO in 5-7 years", "Sustainable profitable business"]
}
```

---

## üéØ **Where to Find These People**

### **Targeted Outreach:**

```python
recruitment_channels = {
    "university_clubs": "AI clubs, entrepreneurship societies, math circles",
    "competition_alumni": "IMO, IOI, ICPC participant directories",
    "research_groups": "University computational linguistics labs",
    "open_source": "Contributors to relevant NLP/language projects on GitHub"
}
```

### **The Initial "Sprint Week" Proposal:**

Instead of asking for long-term commitment upfront, propose:
**"Give me one week (10-15 hours). If you're not excited by the problems and team by Friday, no hard feelings. If you are, we formalize equity and roles."**

---

## ‚ö†Ô∏è **Critical Success Factors**

### **Transparency is Everything:**

```python
trust_builders = {
    "open_finances": "Shared financial model and cap table",
    "clear_milestones": "Specific, measurable goals for each phase",
    "regular_updates": "Weekly progress reports to entire team",
    "legal_clarity": "Proper equity agreements from day one"
}
```

### **What You MUST Bring:**

```python
your_contributions = {
    "proven_progress": "The 70% functional codebase",
    "domain_expertise": "Deep knowledge of language learning space",
    "network_access": "Connections to potential advisors/investors",
    "full_time_commitment": "You're working on this 100%"
}
```

## üé™ **The Final Pitch**

"Look, I know you have offers from Google and hedge funds. But those are jobs. This is ownership. You'll be solving harder problems with more autonomy and potentially 100x the financial upside. The codebase is mostly built - what's missing is your mathematical genius to perfect the algorithms and your cultural insight to make it work globally. You're not building someone else's dream; you're building equity in your own international company."

This approach respects their intelligence, acknowledges the sacrifice you're asking for, and provides a credible path to outsized returns that could genuinely compete with traditional career paths.
