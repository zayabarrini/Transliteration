Useful examples of regular expressions:

([\(（]([^\(\)（）]|(([\(（][^\(\)（）]+[\)）])))+[\)）]) : Remove names enclosed by parenthesis to indicate speakers (e.g. "（山田）　元気ですか？")
(.*)\n+(?!-)(.*) : Some subtitles are split in several lines and this regex forces them into a single line. For this filter to work, you must also put $1 $2 in the "Subtitle regex filter text replacement" field.
NB: When using this regex pattern in combination with other patterns (using the | operator, see below), place this pattern at the end. This ensures that all other regex transformations are applied first, and then the results are finally combined into a single line.
-?\[.*\] : Remove indications enclosed by square brackets that sound or music that is playing (e.g. "[PLAYFUL MUSIC]" or "-[GASPS]")
^[\-\(\)\.\s\p{Lu}]+$ : As an alternative to the above, filter out descriptions written in capital letters, but without the square brackets (e.g. "PLAYFUL MUSIC"). If your language has additional letters with diacritics, you feel free to add them to this list.
[♪♬#～〜]+ : Any combination of symbols on their own that represent playing music (e.g. ♪♬♪)

Here’s a **clean, organized, and complete version** of your metrics outline, structured so it can be easily tracked and expanded into a language learning progression system:

# Language Learning Metrics

## Reading

* **Alphabet** (letters, syllables, characters)
* **Reading Aloud (Spelling)** (pronouncing each word correctly)
* **Basic Conversation Texts** (dialogues, short stories)
* **Music Lyrics** (song texts with rhythm and repetition)
* **Subtitles from Favorite Movies** (contextual learning with audiovisual support)
* **Revistas de Psicanálise** (specialized academic vocabulary)
* **Harry Potter (Literatura)** (popular literature with narrative complexity)
* **Filosofia e Literatura Complexa** (abstract and conceptual reading)

---

## Speaking & Humor

* **Comfort and Duration of Speaking**:

  * 10s sentences (short responses)
  * 20s sentences (expanded answers)
  * 1 min (short speech or explanation)
  * 3 min (narrative or story)
  * 5 min (detailed description or opinion)
  * 15 min (sustained conversation or lecture)
* **Telling a Joke** (timing, wordplay, cultural humor)

---

## Listening & Comprehension

* **Environment Factors**:

  * Reading Aloud (listening to oneself)
  * Speaker (clear audio in room)
  * Headphones (focused listening)
* **Music** (lyrics and rhythm comprehension)
* **Movie** (subtitles + dialogue comprehension)
* **Conversation in a Private Space** (direct 1-on-1 communication)
* **Laughing at a Joke** (understanding humor, double meanings)
* **Group Conversations (Bar, Noisy Environments)** (real-world test of fluency and comprehension under distraction)

---

## Writing

* **Conversation Text** (chat messages, informal writing)
* **Paragraph** (developing a short idea)
* **Text** (structured writing, e.g., an essay or story)
* **Technical Text** (formal, specialized, domain-specific writing)

---

This gives you a **clear progression scale** in all four skills (Reading, Speaking, Listening, Writing), with *increasing complexity* and *contextual environments*.
