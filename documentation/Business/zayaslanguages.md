## Mindset

- GitLab: too big, a lot of challenges, well stablished business. It's beautiful. I love it.
- HubSpot: also beautiful, important, marketing metrics and customers relationship management
- DeepSeek: from China to the world. I'm only working on HomeOffice
- Shopify: global e-commerce platform, they must cater to diverse markets. Their app store, payment gateways (Alipay/WeChat Pay vs. Stripe), and marketing channels are entirely different in China vs. Europe. Their regional teams have the budget and authority to execute local strategies.
- Doist (makers of Todoist & Twist): A fully remote company with a strong presence in Spain. As a productivity app with a global user base, they focus deeply on localization (product and marketing) and operate with a high degree of team autonomy and async communication, fitting the "decentralize authority" principle.

# Zaya's Style

- Not urgent
- I'm a woman, so beauty first, massage first, then a look at the projects
- Need a man/partners for handling flow, emergencies, customer support
