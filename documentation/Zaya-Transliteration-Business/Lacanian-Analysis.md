Giving back to the community
Emptying myself
How did I become so billionaire oriented?
I just want a husband and a home in Mallorca
Happy for getting all the code and tools on the internet for free
And being crank about contribuing for free
Me solving issues for free?
We have to face the hours and language, day after day
Capitalism is an illusion
It all goes back to community
We all work everyday
In whatever language

It's this momment of emptying, the end of a cycle of mania
and then
I was on
And now, I'm awake
and it's been with entrepreneurship, psychoanalysis, instagram, tiktok, onlyfans
Creating, creating, creating
Is it so bad to work for someone who is always creating something?
GitLab is amazing
It's so important for society
Everybody is engaged in writing code
Look at ChatGpt and DeepSeek
IA is the customized alienation experience
You can talk to it
It can work for you, while you work on something else

Blog, Plugins, Repos, Tools, Desktop app, web app, phone app
Look at all the great content related to psychoanalysis that IA produced
It can write code
Almost none of this code I wrote it
I asked for it

Language flows
Math, code, translation - this is the internet
You have the space of your house and an integrated work
You just ended up working
