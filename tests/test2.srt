1
00:00:49,400 --> 00:00:55,322
GERMANY YEAR ZERO

2
00:01:37,865 --> 00:01:45,288
DEDICATED TO THE MEMORY
OF MY SON ROMANO

3
00:02:16,070 --> 00:02:20,282
The Russian sector had jam yesterday,
and the Yanks had margarine.

4
00:02:20,408 --> 00:02:23,994
So they'll slap honey
on bread for us. As always.

5
00:02:24,203 --> 00:02:26,747
I'm sick and tired of it all.

6
00:02:26,873 --> 00:02:28,999
In that case,
jump in that grave.

7
00:02:30,293 --> 00:02:32,586
Enough talk about being tired.

8
00:02:32,754 --> 00:02:37,466
Didn't I say 6. 5 x 5 x 2 feet?

9
00:02:37,759 --> 00:02:39,676
We're not digging for potatoes here.
