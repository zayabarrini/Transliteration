1
00:00:34,451 --> 00:00:39,540
ROME OPEN CITY

2
00:00:51,260 --> 00:00:54,221
The incidents and characters herein,

3
00:00:54,388 --> 00:00:57,766
though based on the tragic and heroic events

4
00:00:57,933 --> 00:01:00,978
during the nine months of Nazi occupation, are fictional.

5
00:01:01,144 --> 00:01:04,106
Any resemblance to actual incidents and characters is purely coincidental.

6
00:01:04,690 --> 00:01:07,401
<i>Soar high, Red Eagle</i>

7
00:01:07,734 --> 00:01:11,238
<i>O'er swamp and sand</i>

8
00:01:11,405 --> 00:01:15,367
<i>O'er dark pine forests</i>

9
00:01:15,534 --> 00:01:19,288
<i>All hail my Brandenburg homeland</i>

10
00:02:00,621 --> 00:02:02,122
Dear God!

11
00:02:34,530 --> 00:02:36,323
I'm coming!

12
00:02:42,329 --> 00:02:44,748
- Engineer Giorgio Manfredi. - He's not here.

13
00:02:44,915 --> 00:02:45,958
Where is he?

14
00:02:46,124 --> 00:02:48,836
We don't know. He doesn't always sleep here.

15
00:02:49,002 --> 00:02:50,504
Where does he go?

16
00:02:50,671 --> 00:02:53,423
I don't know. You know these young bachelors.

17
00:02:53,590 --> 00:02:55,634
Of course. Which is his room?

18
00:02:55,801 --> 00:02:57,302
That way.

19
00:02:58,053 --> 00:02:59,888
Search the house.

20
00:03:08,814 --> 00:03:12,150
- Does he have many visitors? - Before, but not now.

21
00:03:12,317 --> 00:03:14,027
Of course.

22
00:03:27,666 --> 00:03:30,002
- How many other lodgers here? - Two.

23
00:03:30,544 --> 00:03:32,754
- Where's the phone? - End of the hallway.

24
00:03:36,383 --> 00:03:38,135
Stop! I'll answer that!

25
00:03:42,931 --> 00:03:44,683
Is Giorgio there?

26
00:03:45,100 --> 00:03:48,145
Of course. Mr. Manfredi. Who is this?

27
00:03:48,312 --> 00:03:50,439
- A friend of his. - What friend?

28
00:03:50,606 --> 00:03:51,565
Who's this?

29
00:03:59,656 --> 00:04:01,158
Who was that woman?

30
00:04:01,325 --> 00:04:03,118
How should I know? I didn't see her.

31
00:04:03,285 --> 00:04:05,579
- Find anything? - No, nothing.

32
00:04:06,038 --> 00:04:08,832
- And that door? - That's the terrace.

33
00:04:14,630 --> 00:04:16,924
- Keep calm. - Dear God!

34
00:04:40,072 --> 00:04:42,491
- Who lives there? - That's the Spanish embassy.

35
00:04:45,953 --> 00:04:48,789
The city will be divided into 14 sectors.

36
00:04:48,956 --> 00:04:53,168
The Schroder Plan, implemented in various European cities,

37
00:04:53,335 --> 00:04:57,256
will permit dragnet operations on a grand scale

38
00:04:57,422 --> 00:04:59,758
with minimum force.

39
00:05:00,968 --> 00:05:02,261
Come in.

40
00:05:04,137 --> 00:05:06,348
Sergeant Bauer phoned, sir.

41
00:05:06,515 --> 00:05:08,475
They didn't find the person in question.

42
00:05:08,642 --> 00:05:10,310
No? That's odd.

43
00:05:10,644 --> 00:05:14,731
The landlady and servant were there. Shall we bring them in?

44
00:05:14,982 --> 00:05:17,442
No, that's not necessary. Thank you.

45
00:05:21,405 --> 00:05:22,990
Bad news?

46
00:05:23,156 --> 00:05:25,158
Someone missed an appointment.

47
00:05:25,325 --> 00:05:26,952
Someone important?

48
00:05:28,620 --> 00:05:29,997
I hope so.

49
00:05:38,005 --> 00:05:40,090
You know them?

50
00:05:42,551 --> 00:05:44,219
No. Who are they?

51
00:05:45,470 --> 00:05:48,140
He's an engineer by the name of Manfredi.

52
00:05:48,307 --> 00:05:50,225
That name's come to our attention.

53
00:05:50,392 --> 00:05:54,062
Seems he's a military leader of the National Liberation Committee.

54
00:05:54,229 --> 00:05:57,316
I have good reason to believe it's the same man.

55
00:05:57,733 --> 00:05:59,735
How did you spot him?

56
00:05:59,902 --> 00:06:03,197
I found him while sitting right here at this desk.

57
00:06:03,363 --> 00:06:07,075
Every evening I take a long stroll through Rome

58
00:06:07,242 --> 00:06:09,661
without leaving this office.

59
00:06:09,828 --> 00:06:15,000
I'm fond of pictures that catch people unaware.

60
00:06:15,292 --> 00:06:17,878
One comes across such interesting people.

61
00:06:18,045 --> 00:06:23,425
For example, not long ago I came across Mr. Manfredi

62
00:06:23,592 --> 00:06:25,677
and his little girlfriend.

63
00:06:25,844 --> 00:06:31,058
I thought, "I've seen this man somewhere."

64
00:06:32,226 --> 00:06:35,062
Look at this group, for example.

65
00:06:36,772 --> 00:06:38,357
Second from the left.

66
00:06:38,524 --> 00:06:40,734
I received these from Berlin.

67
00:06:41,235 --> 00:06:44,279
I'm not mistaken, am I?

68
00:06:44,446 --> 00:06:47,741
Of course not. It's the same person.

69
00:06:47,908 --> 00:06:49,493
How annoying!

70
00:06:49,660 --> 00:06:50,994
Excuse me.

71
00:06:59,002 --> 00:07:00,254
What's all that noise?

72
00:07:00,420 --> 00:07:04,091
Forgive me, Major. We're interrogating that professor -

73
00:07:04,383 --> 00:07:05,801
Fine, but keep him quiet.

74
00:07:06,426 --> 00:07:08,804
How these Italians scream!

75
00:07:08,971 --> 00:07:10,138
Indeed.

76
00:07:10,931 --> 00:07:12,724
And who's the girl?

77
00:07:12,891 --> 00:07:16,103
A certain Marina Mari, a cabaret performer.

78
00:07:16,270 --> 00:07:19,940
Yes, I've seen her before. Pretty girl.

79
00:07:20,274 --> 00:07:21,400
Very pretty.

80
00:07:22,568 --> 00:07:24,778
Take it easy!

81
00:07:24,945 --> 00:07:27,781
I can't take anymore.

82
00:07:28,073 --> 00:07:31,285
- What's going on? - They stormed the bakery.

83
00:07:31,451 --> 00:07:34,454
- What about you? - Unfortunately I'm in uniform.

84
00:07:34,621 --> 00:07:37,207
<i>- Sergeant! - What do they want?</i>

85
00:07:40,586 --> 00:07:42,880
I can't do anything! This is a riot!

86
00:07:43,046 --> 00:07:46,425
I'm helpless. - But just four ounces a day -

87
00:07:46,592 --> 00:07:50,137
The dirty rat even had pastries. Look!

88
00:07:50,304 --> 00:07:52,222
And they said there was no flour!

89
00:07:52,389 --> 00:07:54,391
Agostino, go get some.

90
00:07:54,558 --> 00:07:58,061
I can't. I'm a sexton. I'd go to hell.

91
00:07:58,228 --> 00:08:00,480
Then wait for your pastries in heaven.

92
00:08:00,647 --> 00:08:02,733
Put those down!

93
00:08:04,776 --> 00:08:07,279
Pina, this is crazy. In your condition?

94
00:08:07,446 --> 00:08:09,156
Should I just starve to death?

95
00:08:09,323 --> 00:08:11,158
<i>Sergeant, help!</i>

96
00:08:11,325 --> 00:08:13,285
Go hang yourself!

97
00:08:13,493 --> 00:08:14,620
I'll see you home.

98
00:08:17,414 --> 00:08:19,666
Bread!

99
00:08:22,711 --> 00:08:25,005
- Here we are. - Thanks.

100
00:08:25,422 --> 00:08:28,133
Shall I carry it up? It's heavy.

101
00:08:31,178 --> 00:08:33,138
This way it'll be lighter.

102
00:08:33,347 --> 00:08:36,767
I really shouldn't, but I've been starving.

103
00:08:39,770 --> 00:08:43,315
Pina, you think these Americans really exist?

104
00:08:44,733 --> 00:08:46,568
It looks that way.

105
00:08:51,240 --> 00:08:54,117
- How about eggs for 16 lire? - Forget it.

106
00:08:54,284 --> 00:08:57,496
How dare you talk black market in my presence!

107
00:08:58,288 --> 00:09:00,499
Sergeant, save your breath.

108
00:09:00,666 --> 00:09:02,084
See you.

109
00:09:08,090 --> 00:09:11,552
- Who are you looking for? - Does Francesco the printer live here?

110
00:09:12,094 --> 00:09:14,429
- Yes, but he's out. - Know where he went?

111
00:09:14,596 --> 00:09:16,557
That's his business, not mine.

112
00:09:17,057 --> 00:09:20,143
- Excuse me, but who are you? - What's it to you?

113
00:09:20,310 --> 00:09:23,313
- You must be Pina. - How did you know?

114
00:09:23,480 --> 00:09:25,357
Francesco always talks about you.

115
00:09:25,524 --> 00:09:27,568
- So you're - - A friend.

116
00:09:27,734 --> 00:09:30,654
Stupid me! I thought you were police!

117
00:09:30,821 --> 00:09:33,365
What can I do for you? - I need to get in his apartment.

118
00:09:33,574 --> 00:09:35,534
I'll get the key.

119
00:09:46,879 --> 00:09:49,214
Sorry. I couldn't find it.

120
00:09:49,381 --> 00:09:50,966
This way.

121
00:09:56,346 --> 00:09:58,682
It's a mess, but -

122
00:09:58,849 --> 00:10:00,267
It doesn't matter.

123
00:10:00,434 --> 00:10:04,021
Listen, do you know Don Pietro, the parish priest?

124
00:10:04,188 --> 00:10:05,439
I'd like to speak to him.

125
00:10:05,606 --> 00:10:08,066
- I'll go get him. - No, not you.

126
00:10:08,233 --> 00:10:10,110
- I'll send my boy. - Better.

127
00:10:10,277 --> 00:10:12,279
Wait for me in there.

128
00:10:14,907 --> 00:10:17,117
Marcello!

129
00:10:21,038 --> 00:10:21,997
What?

130
00:10:22,164 --> 00:10:24,333
- Come down a minute. - I can't.

131
00:10:24,500 --> 00:10:27,920
- Go get Don Pietro, quick. - I'm busy!

132
00:10:28,086 --> 00:10:29,796
I said come down here!

133
00:10:34,134 --> 00:10:36,887
I've told you not to go up to Romoletto's. It's dangerous.

134
00:10:37,054 --> 00:10:39,097
Go get Don Pietro. - What do I tell him?

135
00:10:39,264 --> 00:10:41,975
To come here right away. Now move it.

136
00:10:42,476 --> 00:10:44,436
And don't fool around on the way.

137
00:10:49,483 --> 00:10:52,611
- Don Pietro will be here shortly. - Thanks.

138
00:10:54,363 --> 00:10:56,823
We stormed a bakery this morning.

139
00:10:56,990 --> 00:10:58,742
Second one this week.

140
00:10:58,909 --> 00:11:00,911
How are the women?

141
00:11:01,245 --> 00:11:03,622
Some know why they're doing it,

142
00:11:03,789 --> 00:11:06,500
but most just grab all the bread they can.

143
00:11:07,209 --> 00:11:10,212
This morning someone filched some shoes and a scale.

144
00:11:10,379 --> 00:11:12,464
<i>I'd like to know who filched my stockings!</i>

145
00:11:13,298 --> 00:11:14,299
Excuse me.

146
00:11:14,466 --> 00:11:16,844
I bet you did - Mr. Manfredi!

147
00:11:17,010 --> 00:11:19,388
What are you doing here? Looking for me?

148
00:11:19,555 --> 00:11:20,639
That's right.

149
00:11:20,806 --> 00:11:23,183
I met him on the stairs and let him in -

150
00:11:23,350 --> 00:11:25,310
You could have let me know!

151
00:11:25,477 --> 00:11:28,438
It doesn't matter. I just had a favor to ask.

152
00:11:28,605 --> 00:11:30,816
You're fine just like that. Excuse us.

153
00:11:31,650 --> 00:11:34,653
You see Marina, right? - Yes, at the cabaret.

154
00:11:34,820 --> 00:11:37,364
Please tell her I can't see her for a few days.

155
00:11:37,531 --> 00:11:39,408
I'll phone if I can.

156
00:11:39,575 --> 00:11:41,869
- Anything else? - No, nothing else.

157
00:11:42,035 --> 00:11:44,329
Then good-bye now.

158
00:11:45,289 --> 00:11:48,500
- Does she live with you? - She's my sister.

159
00:11:48,709 --> 00:11:50,335
Surprised, huh?

160
00:11:50,669 --> 00:11:55,007
I wonder what lies she's told you about where she lives.

161
00:11:55,215 --> 00:11:59,219
She's ashamed of us "starving workers." Says she's an artist.

162
00:11:59,386 --> 00:12:01,471
But I wouldn't trade places with her.

163
00:12:01,638 --> 00:12:04,725
Not because she's bad. She's just stupid.

164
00:12:08,270 --> 00:12:11,231
But how do you know Laura?

165
00:12:11,732 --> 00:12:14,276
Sorry. I'm being nosy.

166
00:12:14,443 --> 00:12:16,987
No, she's a good friend of a girl I know.

167
00:12:17,154 --> 00:12:18,822
- Marina? - You know her?

168
00:12:19,406 --> 00:12:21,241
Since she was a baby!

169
00:12:21,408 --> 00:12:25,537
Her mother was a concierge near my father's tinsmith shop.

170
00:12:25,704 --> 00:12:28,332
She and Laura grew up together.

171
00:12:28,999 --> 00:12:31,084
But please don't tell Marina

172
00:12:31,251 --> 00:12:33,587
what I said.

173
00:12:33,754 --> 00:12:35,923
Don't worry. I won't be seeing her again.

174
00:12:36,089 --> 00:12:37,090
Why?

175
00:12:37,257 --> 00:12:41,428
I just feel it's time to end it. It's gone on too long anyway.

176
00:12:42,095 --> 00:12:44,932
- Have you known her long? - Four months.

177
00:12:45,098 --> 00:12:49,561
I'd just arrived in Rome. She used to eat in a certain restaurant.

178
00:12:49,728 --> 00:12:52,231
One day the air-raid alarm went off, and everyone ran.

179
00:12:52,397 --> 00:12:54,399
Just she and I were left.

180
00:12:54,566 --> 00:12:56,777
She just laughed. Wasn't scared at all.

181
00:12:56,944 --> 00:12:59,863
- And you fell in love. - It happens.

182
00:13:00,280 --> 00:13:02,157
Yes, it does.

183
00:13:03,116 --> 00:13:05,327
But she's not the woman for me.

184
00:13:05,494 --> 00:13:09,081
Perhaps if I'd met her when she was younger.

185
00:13:09,248 --> 00:13:12,835
A woman can change, especially when she's in love.

186
00:13:13,001 --> 00:13:15,003
Who told you she's in love?

187
00:13:15,170 --> 00:13:17,256
Why shouldn't she be?

188
00:13:17,464 --> 00:13:20,634
Heavens, I didn't even offer you coffee.

189
00:13:20,801 --> 00:13:23,136
It's no bother. It'll only take a moment.

190
00:13:23,303 --> 00:13:25,138
Mind you, "coffee" in name only.

191
00:13:46,994 --> 00:13:49,663
Stop all this ruckus!

192
00:14:00,632 --> 00:14:02,676
I told you before: No rough stuff.

193
00:14:02,843 --> 00:14:04,636
Watch out, Don Pietro!

194
00:14:09,850 --> 00:14:12,644
Well, well. It's a miracle to see you here.

195
00:14:12,811 --> 00:14:17,107
- My mother sent me. - She's smart. It'll do you good.

196
00:14:17,274 --> 00:14:19,026
Don Pietro, let me finish.

197
00:14:19,193 --> 00:14:22,362
She says to come quickly. It's important.

198
00:14:22,529 --> 00:14:25,407
- What? - I don't know. She acted mysterious.

199
00:14:25,574 --> 00:14:28,368
But I think someone's in Francesco's apartment.

200
00:14:28,911 --> 00:14:31,121
Very well. Let's go.

201
00:14:33,207 --> 00:14:34,583
Gilberto.

202
00:14:35,542 --> 00:14:38,045
You, out of the way.

203
00:14:38,670 --> 00:14:41,465
Agostino will be here soon. You referee.

204
00:14:41,632 --> 00:14:43,550
And behave yourselves.

205
00:14:44,009 --> 00:14:44,968
Here!

206
00:14:45,135 --> 00:14:48,096
Come here. Why are you always running off?

207
00:15:23,340 --> 00:15:25,300
Why don't you come around anymore?

208
00:15:25,467 --> 00:15:29,263
- This is no time for catechism. - What are you saying?

209
00:15:29,429 --> 00:15:31,014
You priests can't understand,

210
00:15:31,181 --> 00:15:34,518
but we have to close ranks against the common enemy.

211
00:15:34,685 --> 00:15:36,562
Who tells you these things?

212
00:15:36,728 --> 00:15:38,063
Romoletto.

213
00:15:38,230 --> 00:15:39,731
Romoletto?

214
00:15:39,898 --> 00:15:42,192
Don Pietro, please don't tell anyone.

215
00:15:44,278 --> 00:15:46,363
Here comes Purgatory.

216
00:15:48,740 --> 00:15:50,075
Don Pietro.

217
00:15:50,242 --> 00:15:52,661
- What have you got there? - I've been shopping.

218
00:15:52,828 --> 00:15:55,372
What a load of bread! Was that your whole ration book?

219
00:15:55,539 --> 00:15:57,040
Not even one coupon.

220
00:15:57,207 --> 00:15:58,458
Why all this bread?

221
00:15:58,625 --> 00:16:01,253
- They were celebrating this morning. - What?

222
00:16:01,420 --> 00:16:04,840
I don't know what holiday. Even the baker didn't know.

223
00:16:05,007 --> 00:16:07,301
Excuse me. I have to go.

224
00:16:07,467 --> 00:16:10,387
- What holiday could it be? - I don't understand.

225
00:16:10,554 --> 00:16:12,431
I hope my mother knew about it.

226
00:16:14,349 --> 00:16:15,851
Here you go.

227
00:16:16,226 --> 00:16:19,771
It's not very good, but at least it's hot. Drink up.

228
00:16:19,938 --> 00:16:22,816
Thanks. Francesco says you two are getting married.

229
00:16:22,983 --> 00:16:26,945
The wedding's a little late... in my condition.

230
00:16:27,112 --> 00:16:32,576
But we set a date a long time ago and had to keep postponing it.

231
00:16:32,743 --> 00:16:34,786
- When is it? - Tomorrow.

232
00:16:34,953 --> 00:16:37,623
- I'll need to get you a present. - Heavens no!

233
00:16:37,789 --> 00:16:41,585
It's just a wartime wedding. Don Pietro says a few words and it's over.

234
00:16:41,752 --> 00:16:43,962
- You're marrying in the church? - Yes.

235
00:16:44,129 --> 00:16:46,840
Francesco didn't want to, but I told him

236
00:16:47,007 --> 00:16:49,551
better Don Pietro, who's at least one of our own,

237
00:16:49,718 --> 00:16:52,721
then some Fascist at city hall, don't you think?

238
00:16:53,263 --> 00:16:55,182
In a way you're right.

239
00:16:55,349 --> 00:16:58,977
The truth is, I believe in God.

240
00:16:59,811 --> 00:17:01,647
Do you work?

241
00:17:01,813 --> 00:17:04,191
I used to. In a fuse factory.

242
00:17:04,358 --> 00:17:08,612
But they threw us out. The Germans are taking everything.

243
00:17:11,031 --> 00:17:12,658
It must be Don Pietro.

244
00:17:19,206 --> 00:17:21,083
Hello, Don Pietro.

245
00:17:21,500 --> 00:17:24,336
Excuse me. I'll be across the hall.

246
00:17:24,503 --> 00:17:27,005
- Thanks for coming. - Don't mention it.

247
00:17:28,632 --> 00:17:30,843
- What's this? - Who's in there?

248
00:17:31,009 --> 00:17:34,596
None of your business. Go get some water. Hurry up.

249
00:17:47,818 --> 00:17:49,987
- I have to talk to you. - Come on.

250
00:17:50,153 --> 00:17:52,531
There are 500 men in the hills above Tagliacozzo.

251
00:17:52,698 --> 00:17:55,075
They're good men. We can't abandon them.

252
00:17:55,242 --> 00:17:59,204
One of them will be waiting at 6:00 on the Tiburtine bridge.

253
00:17:59,371 --> 00:18:03,250
I'd better not go, because I've been denounced.

254
00:18:03,417 --> 00:18:06,128
Besides, the curfew's at 5:00 now.

255
00:18:06,295 --> 00:18:07,671
I see.

256
00:18:09,006 --> 00:18:11,508
I'll go. - I knew you would.

257
00:18:11,800 --> 00:18:13,760
- What's the message? - No message.

258
00:18:13,927 --> 00:18:16,513
It's money from the military committee.

259
00:18:17,431 --> 00:18:19,141
Is it too much to ask?

260
00:18:19,308 --> 00:18:22,561
No, too little, even, for those sacrificing their lives.

261
00:18:22,728 --> 00:18:24,521
How will I recognize him?

262
00:18:24,688 --> 00:18:27,733
He'll whistle that song "Morning in Florence."

263
00:18:27,941 --> 00:18:30,777
But of course you wouldn't know it. - How's it go?

264
00:18:30,944 --> 00:18:32,446
Like this.

265
00:18:38,160 --> 00:18:39,953
Everyone's singing it.

266
00:19:00,807 --> 00:19:02,643
Hello, Father.

267
00:19:02,976 --> 00:19:04,770
How can I help you?

268
00:19:05,354 --> 00:19:07,856
Would you have a statue of St. Anthony the Abbot?

269
00:19:08,023 --> 00:19:11,360
Sorry, but there's not much demand for those now.

270
00:19:11,527 --> 00:19:13,612
But I have a St. Roch.

271
00:19:14,154 --> 00:19:16,156
Thanks, but I'm not interested.

272
00:19:16,323 --> 00:19:19,576
Not interested in a saint like St. Roch?

273
00:19:19,952 --> 00:19:20,911
Step inside.

274
00:19:21,078 --> 00:19:22,746
Come and see.

275
00:19:25,541 --> 00:19:28,627
It's a beauty too. - Let's have a look.

276
00:19:29,002 --> 00:19:30,504
I'll be going.

277
00:19:30,671 --> 00:19:32,756
Remember to stop by Chiurazzi's.

278
00:19:32,923 --> 00:19:34,675
I'll give you a good price.

279
00:19:34,842 --> 00:19:37,511
I need to speak to Francesco.

280
00:19:37,678 --> 00:19:40,305
The man with the tight shoes sent me.

281
00:19:41,348 --> 00:19:42,975
Wait a moment.

282
00:20:00,534 --> 00:20:03,036
Come in, Father. They're waiting for you.

283
00:20:15,174 --> 00:20:16,800
Down these stairs.

284
00:20:23,056 --> 00:20:25,726
Don Pietro, what's happened?

285
00:20:25,893 --> 00:20:28,979
Nothing serious, thank heavens, but it might have been.

286
00:20:29,146 --> 00:20:32,941
The SS were at Manfredi's last night. - We know. Where is he now?

287
00:20:33,108 --> 00:20:34,776
At your place.

288
00:20:34,943 --> 00:20:37,738
Pina let him in. He'll be staying a few days.

289
00:20:39,781 --> 00:20:41,700
He gave me this note.

290
00:20:41,867 --> 00:20:46,246
I wanted to send him to the Passionist monks. He'd be safer there.

291
00:20:46,413 --> 00:20:49,333
But he said he'd be too isolated.

292
00:20:49,500 --> 00:20:50,667
It's true.

293
00:20:50,834 --> 00:20:54,087
But he's in greater danger now that he's been denounced.

294
00:20:54,296 --> 00:20:57,799
Yes, Father, but if our few men all hid in monasteries -

295
00:20:57,966 --> 00:21:00,969
- I understand. - Allow me. This is our editor.

296
00:21:01,136 --> 00:21:02,679
Pleased to meet you.

297
00:21:02,846 --> 00:21:04,973
Same here. I've heard a lot about you.

298
00:21:05,140 --> 00:21:07,434
That's not good for my modesty

299
00:21:07,601 --> 00:21:09,686
or my health.

300
00:21:09,853 --> 00:21:12,814
We appreciate all you've done for us.

301
00:21:12,981 --> 00:21:16,318
It's my duty to help those in need.

302
00:21:16,485 --> 00:21:18,153
Step into my office?

303
00:21:36,839 --> 00:21:38,298
Here you are, Father.

304
00:21:38,465 --> 00:21:41,760
Manfredi said it would be money.

305
00:21:42,094 --> 00:21:44,680
There's not much to read in those books.

306
00:21:45,639 --> 00:21:47,516
What do you mean?

307
00:21:55,691 --> 00:21:58,569
Is it all like that? - A thousand pages.

308
00:22:00,028 --> 00:22:02,322
- One million lire. - Precisely.

309
00:23:01,256 --> 00:23:02,466
Who is it?

310
00:23:02,633 --> 00:23:04,760
<i>It's me. Open up.</i>

311
00:23:16,271 --> 00:23:19,233
- Guess who I saw this morning. - I don't care.

312
00:23:19,441 --> 00:23:22,277
- Manfredi. He came to see me. - You? Where?

313
00:23:22,444 --> 00:23:23,946
At my place.

314
00:23:24,279 --> 00:23:26,031
What did he want?

315
00:23:26,198 --> 00:23:29,368
He said he can't see you for a few days

316
00:23:29,535 --> 00:23:31,495
and that he'll call if necessary.

317
00:23:31,662 --> 00:23:33,455
Nothing else?

318
00:23:33,747 --> 00:23:35,749
He didn't explain?

319
00:23:35,916 --> 00:23:38,043
No, and I didn't ask.

320
00:23:38,252 --> 00:23:41,171
I was in my bathrobe and curlers.

321
00:23:42,589 --> 00:23:45,175
Aren't you going to change? You're on soon.

322
00:23:49,263 --> 00:23:51,223
How did he know where you live?

323
00:23:51,390 --> 00:23:54,393
Good question. You must have told him.

324
00:23:54,601 --> 00:23:56,270
I never told him.

325
00:23:56,436 --> 00:23:59,064
Well, I certainly didn't tell him.

326
00:23:59,231 --> 00:24:02,276
I don't like people knowing where I live.

327
00:24:02,484 --> 00:24:06,196
Speaking of which, I really can't stay there any longer.

328
00:24:06,363 --> 00:24:10,242
Mind if I stay with you until I find another room?

329
00:24:10,576 --> 00:24:13,412
Of course not. I've told you many times.

330
00:24:13,579 --> 00:24:15,289
You're a sweetheart.

331
00:24:20,502 --> 00:24:22,629
- What are you looking for? - A cigarette.

332
00:24:23,172 --> 00:24:25,132
- I'll get you one. - Fine!

333
00:24:26,925 --> 00:24:28,302
Thanks.

334
00:24:28,802 --> 00:24:30,512
- When did he come by? - Who?

335
00:24:30,679 --> 00:24:32,139
Giorgio.

336
00:24:32,514 --> 00:24:34,850
Early this morning. I was getting dressed.

337
00:24:35,350 --> 00:24:37,352
<i>Miss Mari, you're on.</i>

338
00:24:38,103 --> 00:24:40,981
I don't understand. Are you in love with him or not?

339
00:24:41,190 --> 00:24:43,442
He's nice, I'll give you that.

340
00:24:43,609 --> 00:24:45,861
Would you kindly stay out of it?

341
00:24:46,028 --> 00:24:48,155
It's nothing to me, as long as you're happy.

342
00:24:49,573 --> 00:24:51,200
You feel sick?

343
00:24:51,742 --> 00:24:53,327
No, it's nothing.

344
00:24:53,535 --> 00:24:57,414
Marina... again? You know it's bad for you.

345
00:24:57,581 --> 00:24:58,999
That's stupid.

346
00:24:59,208 --> 00:25:03,128
Lots of things are bad for us, but we do them anyway.

347
00:25:04,838 --> 00:25:06,298
I'm coming.

348
00:25:09,510 --> 00:25:11,845
Good evening. How are you?

349
00:25:12,012 --> 00:25:14,473
Fine, and you? How beautiful you look tonight!

350
00:25:14,681 --> 00:25:16,391
But you're always so chic.

351
00:25:16,558 --> 00:25:18,977
- I'll be going. - Ah, Laura.

352
00:25:19,144 --> 00:25:22,147
Try and hurry, or the boss will be mad.

353
00:25:22,314 --> 00:25:24,608
- I have to go. - Yes, dear.

354
00:25:25,776 --> 00:25:27,402
Did you find some?

355
00:25:27,694 --> 00:25:29,363
You're a darling!

356
00:25:44,586 --> 00:25:47,714
He has no schedule anymore - always in and out.

357
00:25:47,881 --> 00:25:51,927
And these days, when you shouldn't even stick your nose out the window.

358
00:25:52,302 --> 00:25:53,720
He's always out and about.

359
00:25:53,887 --> 00:25:56,890
- He must have a good reason. - Let's hope so.

360
00:25:57,057 --> 00:25:58,725
Agostino, I'm surprised at you.

361
00:25:58,892 --> 00:26:00,227
Come now.

362
00:26:00,394 --> 00:26:05,399
You think I don't know you were behind that hubbub at the bakery today?

363
00:26:05,607 --> 00:26:07,234
- Me? - Yes!

364
00:26:07,442 --> 00:26:10,779
You think I'm an idiot? I know all about it.

365
00:26:10,946 --> 00:26:14,116
And if you keep up these antics, you're all headed for trouble.

366
00:26:14,283 --> 00:26:16,660
- Let's hope not. - Yes, let's.

367
00:26:17,327 --> 00:26:19,872
Cabbage soup. - I can tell.

368
00:26:20,080 --> 00:26:22,040
What time is it? The curfew's at 5:00.

369
00:26:22,207 --> 00:26:24,418
Let's see. It's 4:30.

370
00:26:24,585 --> 00:26:27,337
- I better be going. - You want to leave a message?

371
00:26:27,504 --> 00:26:29,882
I wanted to talk to Don Pietro,

372
00:26:30,048 --> 00:26:32,509
but I'll do it tomorrow before the wedding.

373
00:26:32,676 --> 00:26:34,136
Ah, finally.

374
00:26:35,179 --> 00:26:37,806
Good evening, Don Pietro.

375
00:26:41,018 --> 00:26:44,313
I've told you not to cook on the heater.

376
00:26:45,230 --> 00:26:46,857
And cabbage, no less.

377
00:26:48,025 --> 00:26:50,235
Agostino, don't answer back.

378
00:26:50,402 --> 00:26:53,906
- It's either the stove or the heater. - Fine.

379
00:26:55,449 --> 00:26:59,620
More books! No money for food, and you keep buying books.

380
00:26:59,786 --> 00:27:02,414
Hands off. I'm taking them to San Lorenzo.

381
00:27:02,581 --> 00:27:05,792
You're going out again? The curfew's in 20 minutes.

382
00:27:05,959 --> 00:27:09,004
It doesn't matter. Doctors and priests can still be out.

383
00:27:09,171 --> 00:27:11,673
- And midwives too. - What?

384
00:27:11,840 --> 00:27:13,467
I read it on the posters.

385
00:27:13,675 --> 00:27:16,845
But you could get shot in the dark with these thugs around.

386
00:27:17,012 --> 00:27:21,141
Don Pietro, I came... for confession.

387
00:27:21,350 --> 00:27:24,603
I have to go out. Maybe tomorrow morning?

388
00:27:24,770 --> 00:27:28,148
Fine. I'll walk with you a ways now.

389
00:27:29,191 --> 00:27:30,651
Let me carry your package.

390
00:27:30,817 --> 00:27:34,029
We can't have a priest carrying a package.

391
00:27:34,196 --> 00:27:37,241
Besides, I'm already carrying so much.

392
00:27:37,407 --> 00:27:39,743
Come on, it's getting late.

393
00:27:39,910 --> 00:27:42,246
Bye, Agostino. - And stop worrying.

394
00:27:42,412 --> 00:27:44,957
If this war isn't over soon, I'll go crazy!

395
00:28:02,266 --> 00:28:06,061
Are you the priest here? Don Pietro Pellegrini?

396
00:28:06,228 --> 00:28:08,146
I'd like to speak to you.

397
00:28:10,399 --> 00:28:11,984
Please...

398
00:28:12,734 --> 00:28:15,445
I'll be going. Here's your package.

399
00:28:15,904 --> 00:28:18,240
I wonder what he wants. - Who knows?

400
00:28:20,033 --> 00:28:22,202
Perhaps you should...

401
00:28:23,704 --> 00:28:25,747
wait for me over there.

402
00:28:40,679 --> 00:28:42,139
Have a seat.

403
00:28:43,432 --> 00:28:45,225
Step outside a moment.

404
00:28:48,061 --> 00:28:49,521
Please.

405
00:28:51,857 --> 00:28:53,734
What is it?

406
00:29:12,669 --> 00:29:15,547
From Don Saverio Derisi,

407
00:29:15,714 --> 00:29:17,674
the priest in Minturno.

408
00:29:30,938 --> 00:29:33,815
You mustn't think I'm a coward.

409
00:29:34,900 --> 00:29:36,318
I can't take any more!

410
00:29:42,574 --> 00:29:45,953
Don't lose heart. I'll try to help you.

411
00:29:47,621 --> 00:29:49,414
Where have you come from?

412
00:29:50,123 --> 00:29:53,418
Cassino. It's a living hell there!

413
00:30:02,177 --> 00:30:04,596
What did he want? No, I'll carry it.

414
00:30:04,763 --> 00:30:06,723
He wanted information.

415
00:30:06,890 --> 00:30:09,393
Just the sight of those guys and I -

416
00:30:11,270 --> 00:30:14,982
My last confession was so long ago that I'm almost ashamed.

417
00:30:15,148 --> 00:30:17,109
No, let me talk.

418
00:30:17,568 --> 00:30:21,655
I've led a bad life. I've done so much I shouldn't have.

419
00:30:22,072 --> 00:30:26,618
You think I'm not ashamed to be married in my condition?

420
00:30:26,827 --> 00:30:29,079
But you'd never understand.

421
00:30:29,246 --> 00:30:31,415
There are things you do without thinking,

422
00:30:31,582 --> 00:30:34,251
that don't feel like you're doing wrong.

423
00:30:34,418 --> 00:30:35,961
I was so in love,

424
00:30:36,170 --> 00:30:39,089
and he was so good, so decent.

425
00:30:39,590 --> 00:30:43,135
I know he could have found someone better,

426
00:30:43,302 --> 00:30:45,053
a young girl,

427
00:30:45,220 --> 00:30:48,724
not a penniless widow with a child

428
00:30:48,891 --> 00:30:52,227
who had to sell everything just to get by.

429
00:30:52,394 --> 00:30:54,479
And life just keeps getting harder.

430
00:30:55,606 --> 00:31:01,236
How will we ever forget all this suffering, anxiety, and fear?

431
00:31:02,321 --> 00:31:04,573
Doesn't Christ see us?

432
00:31:06,742 --> 00:31:10,871
So many people ask me that: "Doesn't Christ see us?"

433
00:31:11,038 --> 00:31:13,957
But are we sure we haven't deserved this scourge?

434
00:31:14,124 --> 00:31:18,712
Are we sure we've always lived according to the Lord's laws?

435
00:31:19,713 --> 00:31:22,341
People never think of changing their ways,

436
00:31:22,508 --> 00:31:25,928
but when the piper must be paid, they despair and ask,

437
00:31:26,094 --> 00:31:30,057
"Doesn't the Lord see us? Doesn't he take pity on us?"

438
00:31:30,516 --> 00:31:32,684
Yes, he does,

439
00:31:32,851 --> 00:31:36,313
but we have so much to be forgiven for,

440
00:31:36,522 --> 00:31:39,858
and for that we must pray and forgive many things.

441
00:31:40,025 --> 00:31:43,362
You're right, but how do we forgive?

442
00:31:43,529 --> 00:31:47,741
I see those guys and I want to smash their faces in.

443
00:31:47,950 --> 00:31:51,328
You're right. I mean... give me that package.

444
00:31:51,495 --> 00:31:54,832
It's getting late. Good-bye, Pina.

445
00:32:32,619 --> 00:32:34,454
She came looking for help.

446
00:32:34,621 --> 00:32:37,124
The Gestapo had hauled in her fiance.

447
00:32:37,332 --> 00:32:39,710
"Don't worry. I'll take care of it," I told her.

448
00:32:39,877 --> 00:32:42,504
What a pair of legs!

449
00:32:43,547 --> 00:32:45,549
Halt! Hands up!

450
00:32:47,009 --> 00:32:48,677
I have a permit.

451
00:32:51,513 --> 00:32:53,140
Printer.

452
00:32:54,516 --> 00:32:56,768
Says so right there.

453
00:32:57,769 --> 00:33:00,105
All right. Go home quickly.

454
00:33:26,882 --> 00:33:28,967
<i>Auf Wiedersehen, Captain, and thanks.</i>

455
00:33:29,134 --> 00:33:31,637
Good night. See you tomorrow - don't forget.

456
00:33:39,394 --> 00:33:41,855
Francesco, you scared me.

457
00:33:42,940 --> 00:33:46,068
I'm a bit late. They insisted on seeing me home.

458
00:33:46,235 --> 00:33:48,529
Nothing wrong with that, is there?

459
00:33:52,908 --> 00:33:54,535
Hi, Francesco.

460
00:33:55,661 --> 00:33:57,746
- You got away, eh? - This time at least,

461
00:33:57,913 --> 00:33:59,832
with the landlady and Nannina's help.

462
00:33:59,998 --> 00:34:02,709
You know they tore the place apart this morning?

463
00:34:02,918 --> 00:34:04,878
A waste of time. There was nothing there.

464
00:34:05,045 --> 00:34:08,173
- Pina let you in? - Yes, she was very kind.

465
00:34:08,340 --> 00:34:11,218
- What do you think? - You're smart to marry her.

466
00:34:11,385 --> 00:34:14,429
At first she took me for a cop and gave me hell.

467
00:34:14,596 --> 00:34:16,390
I can imagine.

468
00:34:16,598 --> 00:34:19,935
Did you know Don Pietro met Gino? - Really? I'm glad.

469
00:34:20,102 --> 00:34:21,687
What did he say about my matter?

470
00:34:21,895 --> 00:34:23,814
He's worried. You were to meet the old man today.

471
00:34:23,981 --> 00:34:27,276
- When did he get in? - Last night. But you can't see him.

472
00:34:27,442 --> 00:34:31,446
Gino says you have to drop all contact with central for a while.

473
00:34:32,030 --> 00:34:35,284
True, but to stop short after months of work!

474
00:34:35,450 --> 00:34:40,080
How'd they catch on to me? We have to find out what they know.

475
00:34:40,289 --> 00:34:43,709
We'll try, but it won't be easy with the Gestapo.

476
00:34:43,876 --> 00:34:46,378
If it was the Italian police -

477
00:34:46,837 --> 00:34:49,756
Let's hope Don Pietro met our friend from Tagliacozzo.

478
00:34:49,923 --> 00:34:51,800
Let's hope so.

479
00:34:55,470 --> 00:34:57,556
Ah, I brought you our newspaper.

480
00:35:00,142 --> 00:35:01,894
Came out all right, didn't it?

481
00:35:02,311 --> 00:35:03,937
How many copies?

482
00:35:04,104 --> 00:35:05,647
Twelve thousand.

483
00:35:07,649 --> 00:35:09,276
That's Pina.

484
00:35:13,405 --> 00:35:15,032
Hi. How are you?

485
00:35:15,324 --> 00:35:17,618
I'm worried about Marcello. He's disappeared.

486
00:35:17,784 --> 00:35:20,329
I've searched the whole building.

487
00:35:20,496 --> 00:35:22,706
- He's probably at Romoletto's. - He's not.

488
00:35:22,873 --> 00:35:25,292
And two other boys are missing too.

489
00:35:25,501 --> 00:35:27,169
Where could they have gone?

490
00:35:27,336 --> 00:35:30,297
- I'm afraid they've gone out. - After curfew?

491
00:36:07,793 --> 00:36:10,212
Well done. I'm proud of you.

492
00:36:12,714 --> 00:36:14,508
Let's step on it, boys.

493
00:36:17,594 --> 00:36:19,638
Let's wait for Otello.

494
00:36:31,400 --> 00:36:33,026
Good night.

495
00:36:38,407 --> 00:36:42,327
<i>So you're still alive! Well, I'll kill you now!</i>

496
00:36:43,787 --> 00:36:46,999
If I had a father like that, I'd show him.

497
00:36:47,166 --> 00:36:48,667
Good night.

498
00:36:51,253 --> 00:36:54,423
You little devil! Coming home at this hour!

499
00:37:02,931 --> 00:37:05,225
We'd better go in one at a time.

500
00:37:05,392 --> 00:37:07,019
You're right. You go first.

501
00:37:07,186 --> 00:37:08,562
<i>You little monsters!</i>

502
00:37:08,770 --> 00:37:09,438
They're back.

503
00:37:09,605 --> 00:37:10,689
Trouble-maker!

504
00:37:10,856 --> 00:37:14,693
I'll tan your hide! Give me heart failure, will you?

505
00:37:16,445 --> 00:37:18,822
I'm going over for a minute or there'll be murder.

506
00:37:19,114 --> 00:37:21,116
- Look how they look! - Where were you?

507
00:37:21,283 --> 00:37:22,910
- At Romoletto's. - No, you weren't!

508
00:37:23,118 --> 00:37:25,078
- We were downstairs. - Where?

509
00:37:25,287 --> 00:37:27,998
- Can't you see they're lying? - I'll kill him!

510
00:37:28,165 --> 00:37:30,667
No, I'll slap 'em silly!

511
00:37:30,834 --> 00:37:33,378
Get to bed, you two.

512
00:37:33,545 --> 00:37:36,381
Calm down. - I've had it with them!

513
00:37:36,548 --> 00:37:38,050
They're just kids.

514
00:37:38,592 --> 00:37:43,305
I can't get a moment's peace here! I work all day!

515
00:37:43,472 --> 00:37:44,765
Some work!

516
00:37:44,932 --> 00:37:47,726
What was that? Speak clearly!

517
00:37:47,893 --> 00:37:49,353
You'd better just go back to bed.

518
00:37:49,520 --> 00:37:52,314
Can't I talk in my own home?

519
00:37:52,481 --> 00:37:54,399
This is my home. Go talk in your own room.

520
00:37:54,566 --> 00:37:57,653
We pay for kitchen privileges. - Laura, forget it.

521
00:37:57,820 --> 00:38:00,072
Forget it? I'm fed up with living in this zoo!

522
00:38:00,239 --> 00:38:01,782
Then get out!

523
00:38:01,990 --> 00:38:06,829
Do you people have to fight every night?

524
00:38:07,538 --> 00:38:11,083
If she doesn't leave, one of these days I'll -

525
00:38:11,500 --> 00:38:14,127
Elide, is it ready yet?

526
00:38:14,628 --> 00:38:16,713
Oh! It's probably burned!

527
00:38:16,880 --> 00:38:18,715
That little witch!

528
00:38:19,132 --> 00:38:20,592
Come here.

529
00:38:23,595 --> 00:38:25,222
It's a surprise.

530
00:38:25,389 --> 00:38:30,477
Elide's baking a cake for your wedding tomorrow.

531
00:38:30,727 --> 00:38:34,982
I hope you two won't quarrel at the last minute,

532
00:38:35,148 --> 00:38:39,319
because we're going to have a real feast!

533
00:38:41,446 --> 00:38:44,408
- That's his greatest worry. - Off to bed. Good night.

534
00:38:44,575 --> 00:38:46,994
Turn out the light, will ya?

535
00:38:51,623 --> 00:38:53,458
We fixed 'em good, eh?

536
00:38:53,625 --> 00:38:55,210
You never take me along.

537
00:38:55,377 --> 00:38:56,753
You're a woman!

538
00:38:56,920 --> 00:38:59,756
So? Can't women be heroes too?

539
00:38:59,923 --> 00:39:02,426
Sure, but Romoletto says

540
00:39:02,593 --> 00:39:05,554
that women always mean trouble.

541
00:39:05,721 --> 00:39:07,055
You still awake?

542
00:39:07,222 --> 00:39:08,724
Under the covers!

543
00:39:17,149 --> 00:39:18,609
Go to sleep.

544
00:39:25,240 --> 00:39:26,825
Can't sleep?

545
00:39:28,494 --> 00:39:29,953
I'm not sleepy.

546
00:39:31,038 --> 00:39:33,457
Where did you boys go with Romoletto?

547
00:39:33,624 --> 00:39:35,417
I can't tell you.

548
00:39:35,584 --> 00:39:37,211
Not even me?

549
00:39:38,253 --> 00:39:40,380
No, it's a secret.

550
00:39:41,632 --> 00:39:43,342
Then you're right.

551
00:39:43,509 --> 00:39:45,469
You mustn't tell anyone.

552
00:39:50,265 --> 00:39:51,808
Good night.

553
00:39:56,188 --> 00:39:57,147
Hey...

554
00:39:58,941 --> 00:40:00,442
What?

555
00:40:02,444 --> 00:40:05,614
Do I really start calling you "papa" tomorrow?

556
00:40:06,448 --> 00:40:07,574
If you want.

557
00:40:07,783 --> 00:40:10,035
I do. I really like you.

558
00:40:21,797 --> 00:40:23,006
What's wrong?

559
00:40:23,799 --> 00:40:25,717
I had a fight with my sister.

560
00:40:25,884 --> 00:40:27,344
Again?

561
00:40:27,803 --> 00:40:29,721
She wants to leave.

562
00:40:29,888 --> 00:40:32,391
Says she won't even come to the wedding.

563
00:40:32,683 --> 00:40:34,643
That's just talk.

564
00:40:34,810 --> 00:40:38,438
No, she was serious. She's packing her bags.

565
00:40:38,856 --> 00:40:41,149
She'll change her mind tomorrow.

566
00:40:42,151 --> 00:40:44,069
I'm so tired!

567
00:40:44,236 --> 00:40:45,445
There now.

568
00:40:46,029 --> 00:40:47,614
I'm so tired!

569
00:40:47,823 --> 00:40:50,450
Go on and cry. Come in for a while.

570
00:40:54,621 --> 00:40:57,583
- No, he's in there. - So? He's a friend.

571
00:40:57,791 --> 00:41:01,378
I've wanted to talk with you alone for so long.

572
00:41:01,753 --> 00:41:02,963
Come here.

573
00:41:04,173 --> 00:41:05,757
Let's sit down here,

574
00:41:05,966 --> 00:41:09,678
like the very first time we talked. Remember?

575
00:41:11,013 --> 00:41:13,765
You knocked on my door with a look on your face -

576
00:41:14,349 --> 00:41:18,478
You drove a nail in the wall and knocked my mirror down.

577
00:41:18,687 --> 00:41:20,689
Luckily it didn't break.

578
00:41:21,273 --> 00:41:24,443
"Who do you think you are? King of the universe?"

579
00:41:24,610 --> 00:41:26,570
You were so rude to me.

580
00:41:26,737 --> 00:41:30,782
In two months you never once said hello on the stairs.

581
00:41:31,033 --> 00:41:33,202
It's been two years now.

582
00:41:33,368 --> 00:41:35,662
How long ago that seems now.

583
00:41:35,829 --> 00:41:39,958
And how things have changed, though we were already at war then.

584
00:41:40,584 --> 00:41:43,420
Everyone foolishly thought it would be over quickly

585
00:41:43,587 --> 00:41:47,299
and that we'd only see it on newsreels.

586
00:41:47,466 --> 00:41:49,384
When is it going to end?

587
00:41:50,552 --> 00:41:53,514
Sometimes I just can't go on.

588
00:41:54,848 --> 00:41:57,434
This winter feels like it will never end.

589
00:41:57,601 --> 00:41:59,603
It will end, Pina...

590
00:42:00,312 --> 00:42:02,314
and spring will come again,

591
00:42:02,481 --> 00:42:06,193
more beautiful than ever, because we'll be free.

592
00:42:06,443 --> 00:42:09,279
We have to believe it and want it.

593
00:42:09,863 --> 00:42:12,825
I can feel these things inside,

594
00:42:13,033 --> 00:42:15,118
but I can't explain them.

595
00:42:15,285 --> 00:42:16,829
Manfredi could.

596
00:42:16,995 --> 00:42:20,707
He's an educated man who's been to college and traveled.

597
00:42:21,208 --> 00:42:23,168
He can really talk well.

598
00:42:23,335 --> 00:42:25,128
But I think it's like this:

599
00:42:25,295 --> 00:42:28,882
We mustn't be afraid now or in the future,

600
00:42:29,091 --> 00:42:33,220
because we're on the just path. Understand, Pina?

601
00:42:35,514 --> 00:42:38,225
We're fighting for something that has to be,

602
00:42:38,392 --> 00:42:40,394
that can't help coming.

603
00:42:40,936 --> 00:42:43,605
The road may be long and hard,

604
00:42:44,398 --> 00:42:48,068
but we'll get there, and we'll see a better world.

605
00:42:48,277 --> 00:42:50,779
And our children especially will see it -

606
00:42:50,946 --> 00:42:54,158
Marcello and the one on the way.

607
00:42:54,533 --> 00:42:57,494
That's why you mustn't ever be afraid,

608
00:42:57,661 --> 00:42:59,163
whatever happens.

609
00:42:59,538 --> 00:43:00,789
Right?

610
00:43:03,041 --> 00:43:06,044
But I'm never afraid.

611
00:43:14,236 --> 00:43:15,279
Hello?

612
00:43:15,487 --> 00:43:17,906
Ah, Miss Mari. No one's seen him.

613
00:43:18,073 --> 00:43:22,578
He hasn't at least called or sent someone over?

614
00:43:23,370 --> 00:43:25,080
Nannina, tell me the truth.

615
00:43:25,247 --> 00:43:27,708
You know something. You know where he is.

616
00:43:27,875 --> 00:43:30,085
I swear I don't.

617
00:43:30,252 --> 00:43:32,004
If I did, I'd tell you.

618
00:43:32,338 --> 00:43:34,006
Let's hope not.

619
00:43:34,590 --> 00:43:35,924
Good night.

620
00:43:36,091 --> 00:43:38,677
The dummy, asking for information over the phone.

621
00:43:38,844 --> 00:43:40,679
The Gestapo will get us all!

622
00:43:59,156 --> 00:44:00,491
Come in.

623
00:44:02,034 --> 00:44:03,869
The chief of police, sir.

624
00:44:04,036 --> 00:44:05,662
Show him in.

625
00:44:08,832 --> 00:44:11,210
Dear friend, you've come at the right moment.

626
00:44:12,086 --> 00:44:14,922
Something very interesting has turned up.

627
00:44:15,089 --> 00:44:19,718
Our Mr. Manfredi was spotted this morning around Prenestino.

628
00:44:20,803 --> 00:44:22,054
And just a while ago,

629
00:44:22,388 --> 00:44:28,811
a tank car of gasoline was blown up in the rail yard in the same area.

630
00:44:29,019 --> 00:44:33,732
My dear major, my news is even more sensational.

631
00:44:33,899 --> 00:44:36,902
I spent the afternoon in our records office,

632
00:44:37,069 --> 00:44:41,657
and I too had a very interesting encounter.

633
00:44:41,824 --> 00:44:44,118
Fantastic!

634
00:44:44,284 --> 00:44:46,120
"Ferraris, Luigi.

635
00:44:46,286 --> 00:44:48,205
Born in Turin, October 3, 1906.

636
00:44:48,372 --> 00:44:51,000
Arrested in Bologna on February 4, 1928.

637
00:44:51,166 --> 00:44:56,630
Sentenced to 12 years for conspiring against the state.

638
00:44:56,797 --> 00:45:00,718
Escaped during transport. Spotted in Paris and Marseille."

639
00:45:02,177 --> 00:45:04,513
Luigi Ferraris.

640
00:45:06,223 --> 00:45:09,268
You've outdone me. - Oh, I would never presume.

641
00:45:09,435 --> 00:45:13,480
In any case, the important thing still remains: To nab him.

642
00:45:13,647 --> 00:45:16,316
Don't worry. He won't get away from me.

643
00:45:16,483 --> 00:45:18,902
- Shall I see to it? - I forbid you!

644
00:45:19,069 --> 00:45:20,738
I mean...

645
00:45:20,946 --> 00:45:25,576
not that I don't trust your methods, but I prefer to do it myself.

646
00:45:25,784 --> 00:45:27,286
Excuse me.

647
00:45:37,212 --> 00:45:38,672
Ingrid.

648
00:45:50,809 --> 00:45:52,561
Good evening. How are you?

649
00:45:52,728 --> 00:45:54,021
My dear lady.

650
00:45:54,188 --> 00:45:55,981
Thanks for the flowers and coffee.

651
00:45:56,148 --> 00:45:59,651
I see you're corrupting my staff,

652
00:45:59,818 --> 00:46:01,612
but you're forgiven.

653
00:46:01,779 --> 00:46:04,531
He's made a very interesting discovery.

654
00:46:04,698 --> 00:46:06,033
Really?

655
00:46:12,331 --> 00:46:13,957
Fantastic!

656
00:46:15,626 --> 00:46:19,963
The time for talk is over. We must act immediately.

657
00:46:21,006 --> 00:46:23,217
Yes. Leave it to me.

658
00:46:24,885 --> 00:46:26,387
Hello.

659
00:46:26,845 --> 00:46:28,472
Hello, children.

660
00:46:30,224 --> 00:46:31,975
Praised be Jesus Christ.

661
00:46:32,142 --> 00:46:34,061
Forever and ever.

662
00:46:41,026 --> 00:46:43,153
Praised be Jesus Christ.

663
00:46:43,570 --> 00:46:44,738
Forever and ever.

664
00:46:44,905 --> 00:46:47,908
But you're always the last... to praise him.

665
00:46:54,039 --> 00:46:55,040
Who is it?

666
00:46:55,207 --> 00:46:56,542
<i>Police!</i>

667
00:46:56,709 --> 00:46:57,710
Morning, Sergeant.

668
00:46:58,002 --> 00:47:00,254
Wait a moment. I'm dressing.

669
00:47:00,421 --> 00:47:04,717
Then with your permission, we'll pay our respects to your intended.

670
00:47:11,390 --> 00:47:15,019
The Germans and Fascists are surrounding the building.

671
00:47:41,628 --> 00:47:42,463
Let's go.

672
00:47:43,130 --> 00:47:47,217
Get everybody out of the building, now!

673
00:47:48,260 --> 00:47:50,054
They're surrounding the building.

674
00:47:50,220 --> 00:47:51,764
Get inside.

675
00:48:10,449 --> 00:48:15,079
Go up and bring everyone down, from every floor.

676
00:48:15,245 --> 00:48:18,832
You go that way and do the same.

677
00:48:20,167 --> 00:48:24,421
Tell them they're to go upstairs and bring everyone down immediately.

678
00:48:24,588 --> 00:48:28,092
You three go that way and bring everybody down.

679
00:48:28,467 --> 00:48:31,053
You men go that way and do the same.

680
00:48:34,348 --> 00:48:36,392
Be strict with these tenants.

681
00:48:36,975 --> 00:48:39,103
What are you doing? Come here.

682
00:48:39,895 --> 00:48:42,231
Come here! What's he looking for?

683
00:48:42,398 --> 00:48:43,857
What are you doing here?

684
00:48:44,024 --> 00:48:47,778
I'm here on duty, but I have to go. I'm a sergeant.

685
00:48:50,322 --> 00:48:51,907
Nonsense. He stays here.

686
00:48:52,116 --> 00:48:53,784
You must stay here.

687
00:49:04,336 --> 00:49:05,879
Marcello!

688
00:49:09,550 --> 00:49:11,885
- What is it? - The Germans and Fascists!

689
00:49:12,052 --> 00:49:13,554
- Where? - In our building.

690
00:49:13,721 --> 00:49:17,057
- Let's go, boys. - Hold it there a moment.

691
00:49:17,224 --> 00:49:18,809
It's the Germans!

692
00:49:19,018 --> 00:49:22,354
- You stay here. I'll go. - We have to go too!

693
00:49:22,521 --> 00:49:24,148
I said to stay here.

694
00:49:24,356 --> 00:49:26,734
But Romoletto has bombs in the attic.

695
00:49:35,909 --> 00:49:38,912
- Quick, to the railroad! - The Germans are downstairs.

696
00:49:39,079 --> 00:49:41,123
- Francesco? - He's getting rid of the stuff.

697
00:49:41,290 --> 00:49:44,084
Don't worry. They won't find him.

698
00:49:44,251 --> 00:49:46,420
- Don't tell Pina. - Don't worry.

699
00:49:50,549 --> 00:49:52,593
- What are you doing here? - Getting my things.

700
00:49:52,760 --> 00:49:55,846
Get outside. We'll see that no one touches them.

701
00:49:56,055 --> 00:49:58,974
How stupid of me not to think of that.

702
00:50:06,565 --> 00:50:08,359
Hurry. Over there.

703
00:50:10,402 --> 00:50:13,655
- Where's Francesco? - Don't worry. He's safe.

704
00:50:14,281 --> 00:50:17,576
Those bastards! They're even dragging the sick down.

705
00:50:20,162 --> 00:50:23,332
Grandfather wouldn't come down. What'll they do to him?

706
00:50:23,499 --> 00:50:26,043
Nothing. Don't worry. Go over there.

707
00:50:26,251 --> 00:50:29,505
<i>My boy!</i>

708
00:50:32,966 --> 00:50:34,093
Giorgio!

709
00:50:35,344 --> 00:50:37,513
Just look at that!

710
00:50:37,680 --> 00:50:41,058
- Where was he hiding? - I don't know.

711
00:50:41,266 --> 00:50:44,436
They took him away. What'll they do to him?

712
00:50:45,104 --> 00:50:48,315
No men in this building? Nonsense!

713
00:50:48,482 --> 00:50:50,275
Where are all the men?

714
00:50:50,442 --> 00:50:52,569
You hear? Where are the men?

715
00:50:52,778 --> 00:50:54,863
How should I know? I'm not the doorman.

716
00:50:56,031 --> 00:50:57,991
What does he want?

717
00:50:58,158 --> 00:51:00,411
- Where are you going? - To comfort a sick man.

718
00:51:00,619 --> 00:51:01,829
The parish priest.

719
00:51:01,996 --> 00:51:03,288
Don't bother.

720
00:51:03,455 --> 00:51:06,041
We brought everyone down for a little fresh air.

721
00:51:06,208 --> 00:51:08,919
Impossible. A man that sick? I have to go up.

722
00:51:09,086 --> 00:51:10,045
Hold it!

723
00:51:10,212 --> 00:51:13,132
Ah, finally. The poor man was begging for you.

724
00:51:13,298 --> 00:51:15,426
He's probably dead by now. Go on.

725
00:51:15,634 --> 00:51:17,678
Wait! They brought everyone down.

726
00:51:17,845 --> 00:51:19,930
No, not this paralyzed old man.

727
00:51:20,139 --> 00:51:21,765
Hurry, Father.

728
00:51:22,224 --> 00:51:25,728
Some service! They used to be as prompt as firemen.

729
00:51:47,374 --> 00:51:49,460
Romoletto, open up!

730
00:51:49,668 --> 00:51:51,712
It's me and Don Pietro!

731
00:51:51,879 --> 00:51:53,672
<i>Go away!</i>

732
00:51:54,006 --> 00:51:55,966
Open up!

733
00:51:56,175 --> 00:51:58,635
<i>Go away, or you'll be blown up with me.</i>

734
00:51:58,844 --> 00:52:00,554
I said to open up!

735
00:52:09,730 --> 00:52:12,274
- What are you doing? - I'll kill them all!

736
00:52:12,441 --> 00:52:15,486
You want to kill us all, you lunatic?

737
00:52:15,694 --> 00:52:17,029
Hold it there!

738
00:52:17,196 --> 00:52:18,739
<i>Help, Antonio!</i>

739
00:52:18,906 --> 00:52:19,990
Let me go!

740
00:52:21,992 --> 00:52:24,161
What floor is this dying man on?

741
00:52:24,370 --> 00:52:26,789
I don't know. Third or fourth.

742
00:52:26,955 --> 00:52:30,793
I'll go have a look. I'm a bit of a doctor myself.

743
00:52:31,794 --> 00:52:32,920
I'll go too.

744
00:52:33,087 --> 00:52:35,506
No, I don't like your face.

745
00:52:58,195 --> 00:52:59,405
<i>No one's here.</i>

746
00:52:59,571 --> 00:53:01,448
Let's try the next floor.

747
00:53:19,675 --> 00:53:21,218
The door!

748
00:53:53,625 --> 00:53:57,004
Are you crazy? What are you doing here?

749
00:53:57,171 --> 00:53:59,048
I'm perfectly fine!

750
00:53:59,214 --> 00:54:02,509
Lie back down and pretend you're sick.

751
00:54:02,676 --> 00:54:04,636
I'm fine! I'll live to be 100!

752
00:54:04,803 --> 00:54:07,765
The SS are coming! The Germans!

753
00:54:07,931 --> 00:54:11,727
To hell with the Germans, and the Fascists too -

754
00:54:13,228 --> 00:54:14,897
Hand me that.

755
00:54:24,239 --> 00:54:25,908
Look in there.

756
00:55:05,823 --> 00:55:08,575
Come on, wake up.

757
00:55:10,244 --> 00:55:11,662
Give me that.

758
00:55:15,040 --> 00:55:16,667
Come on.

759
00:55:21,714 --> 00:55:25,217
You really let him have it!

760
00:55:29,221 --> 00:55:30,931
It's all right.

761
00:55:38,939 --> 00:55:41,692
You have pretty eyes.

762
00:55:57,791 --> 00:55:59,168
Bastard!

763
00:56:56,141 --> 00:56:57,601
Get ready.

764
00:56:58,310 --> 00:57:00,688
Watch for when they round the turn.

765
00:57:01,647 --> 00:57:03,774
Aim at the drivers.

766
00:58:36,171 --> 00:58:39,466
Flavio, us bring meat.

767
00:58:40,800 --> 00:58:42,427
- Where? - Here.

768
00:58:45,555 --> 00:58:49,434
What good is this? I'm an innkeeper, not a butcher.

769
00:58:49,601 --> 00:58:50,977
Us slaughter.

770
00:58:51,144 --> 00:58:54,439
Yes, you people specialize in that.

771
00:58:55,273 --> 00:58:57,317
Good evening, Mr. Manfredi.

772
00:58:57,484 --> 00:58:59,194
Go right in.

773
00:59:02,155 --> 00:59:04,574
Evening, sir. Miss Mari's waiting for you.

774
00:59:04,741 --> 00:59:05,867
Let's leave.

775
00:59:06,076 --> 00:59:08,995
Giorgio, finally! I've looked everywhere for you.

776
00:59:09,162 --> 00:59:11,623
I hoped you'd come here. What's happened?

777
00:59:11,790 --> 00:59:13,166
Nothing. Why?

778
00:59:13,333 --> 00:59:16,127
What could have happened? I don't understand.

779
00:59:16,294 --> 00:59:17,545
At your place -

780
00:59:17,712 --> 00:59:20,799
Allow me to introduce a friend. Sit down, Francesco.

781
00:59:21,049 --> 00:59:22,759
It's a pleasure. Marina.

782
00:59:23,259 --> 00:59:25,595
The SS were looking for you? - Who said so?

783
00:59:25,762 --> 00:59:27,472
Your concierge. But why?

784
00:59:27,639 --> 00:59:29,683
Maybe 'cause I'm an officer.

785
00:59:29,849 --> 00:59:33,186
- Where are you staying now? - We'll stay with a friend tonight.

786
00:59:33,353 --> 00:59:34,729
Why not my place?

787
00:59:34,896 --> 00:59:36,356
- No. - Why?

788
00:59:36,564 --> 00:59:39,150
I wouldn't impose, and he's with me.

789
00:59:39,317 --> 00:59:43,363
He can take the sofa. You'll be very comfortable.

790
00:59:43,530 --> 00:59:45,824
- Spaghetti for three? - We'll talk later.

791
00:59:45,991 --> 00:59:48,576
- Ration books, please. - I don't have one.

792
00:59:48,785 --> 00:59:50,787
I'll give him a coupon for you.

793
00:59:52,330 --> 00:59:55,625
- What else? - I'll take care of these folks.

794
00:59:59,254 --> 01:00:01,256
- They arrested Mezzetti. - When?

795
01:00:01,464 --> 01:00:04,009
At 6:00 this morning. The painter told me.

796
01:00:04,175 --> 01:00:07,470
If we don't lay low for a while, they'll nab us all.

797
01:00:07,637 --> 01:00:09,556
You planned to stay there, right?

798
01:00:09,723 --> 01:00:11,850
Someone here talked.

799
01:00:19,774 --> 01:00:21,693
Poor creatures.

800
01:01:45,443 --> 01:01:49,572
There's always an American station playing jazz at this hour.

801
01:01:53,743 --> 01:01:55,954
Shall we have a little drink, boys?

802
01:01:58,039 --> 01:02:00,709
This liqueur was a gift.

803
01:02:01,167 --> 01:02:02,836
It'll warm us up.

804
01:02:07,340 --> 01:02:09,175
Do you feel ill?

805
01:02:11,219 --> 01:02:14,264
You have a fever. He's burning up.

806
01:02:14,431 --> 01:02:17,600
I'll make up your bed. - Don't go to any bother.

807
01:02:19,686 --> 01:02:21,730
Chin up, Francesco.

808
01:02:23,815 --> 01:02:25,317
Help me, Giorgio.

809
01:02:26,276 --> 01:02:28,528
You'll see. You'll be very comfortable.

810
01:02:28,987 --> 01:02:31,323
I'll get you an aspirin when you're in bed.

811
01:02:32,949 --> 01:02:34,993
Hand me that blanket, please.

812
01:02:37,620 --> 01:02:40,832
You have to be careful. There's plenty of flu going around.

813
01:02:40,999 --> 01:02:44,377
It's all there's plenty of these days!

814
01:02:45,629 --> 01:02:47,589
Who can that be at this hour?

815
01:02:54,220 --> 01:02:54,971
Who is it?

816
01:02:55,138 --> 01:02:57,891
<i>- Marina, it's me. - Oh, it's you.</i>

817
01:02:59,768 --> 01:03:02,646
Hello, sweetie. You see, I did come!

818
01:03:02,812 --> 01:03:04,731
Fritz didn't want to let me go -

819
01:03:04,898 --> 01:03:06,441
Are you drunk?

820
01:03:06,650 --> 01:03:08,401
A wee bit.

821
01:03:08,568 --> 01:03:10,570
Then go straight to bed.

822
01:03:11,696 --> 01:03:14,115
Who's in there? You got company?

823
01:03:16,951 --> 01:03:19,621
Oh, the engineer!

824
01:03:20,622 --> 01:03:22,123
Laura, go to bed!

825
01:03:22,499 --> 01:03:24,459
I'm not gonna eat him!

826
01:03:24,876 --> 01:03:26,836
Francesco, what are you doing here?

827
01:03:27,671 --> 01:03:30,548
Pina kicked you out on your wedding night!

828
01:03:30,715 --> 01:03:34,094
I think Marina's right. Put her to bed.

829
01:03:34,719 --> 01:03:35,679
Come on.

830
01:03:35,845 --> 01:03:37,764
What long faces! What a welcome!

831
01:03:37,931 --> 01:03:41,643
I should have stayed with Fritz. I'm going to tell Pina.

832
01:03:44,125 --> 01:03:47,796
Go to bed. I'll get you some aspirin.

833
01:03:50,215 --> 01:03:52,884
I fought with my sister. I'm never going back.

834
01:03:53,051 --> 01:03:54,678
<i>- Marina. - Come in.</i>

835
01:03:54,844 --> 01:03:56,721
Don't look!

836
01:03:57,430 --> 01:03:58,890
<i>I came to get aspirin.</i>

837
01:03:59,057 --> 01:04:02,018
There should be some in the drawer.

838
01:04:06,356 --> 01:04:08,441
That idiot was just what we needed.

839
01:04:08,608 --> 01:04:11,361
What do we do now? Where will you sleep?

840
01:04:11,528 --> 01:04:14,656
Don't worry. I'll be fine in an armchair.

841
01:04:15,156 --> 01:04:17,367
You'll be cold and uncomfortable.

842
01:04:17,534 --> 01:04:19,035
What a shame.

843
01:04:21,871 --> 01:04:23,665
Hello?

844
01:04:25,208 --> 01:04:27,836
Oh, it's you. Good evening.

845
01:04:28,044 --> 01:04:29,796
How are you, sweetheart?

846
01:04:30,922 --> 01:04:33,300
I've been waiting for you to call.

847
01:04:34,551 --> 01:04:37,095
You're not alone? - What about him?

848
01:04:39,556 --> 01:04:41,349
Have you seen him?

849
01:04:42,142 --> 01:04:43,602
Is he there?

850
01:04:44,394 --> 01:04:46,187
Oh, it's Laura.

851
01:04:46,521 --> 01:04:49,524
She came to stay with me for a few days.

852
01:04:54,070 --> 01:04:55,113
Yes, of course.

853
01:04:56,364 --> 01:04:57,324
All right.

854
01:04:58,199 --> 01:05:00,076
We'll talk tomorrow morning.

855
01:05:01,536 --> 01:05:02,996
Good night.

856
01:05:06,207 --> 01:05:08,835
- Why's this in your purse? - What?

857
01:05:13,965 --> 01:05:18,595
The dentist gave me that for that bad tooth pain, remember?

858
01:05:18,762 --> 01:05:20,221
No, I don't.

859
01:05:20,388 --> 01:05:22,474
Sure you do. This tooth.

860
01:05:22,724 --> 01:05:25,518
I had to use it to kill the pain.

861
01:05:25,685 --> 01:05:29,397
- And it still hurts? - No, that was a long time ago.

862
01:05:30,941 --> 01:05:33,068
But you carry it around just in case.

863
01:05:33,276 --> 01:05:35,695
I planned to take it back to the dentist.

864
01:05:36,279 --> 01:05:39,074
Ah, that explains everything.

865
01:05:39,616 --> 01:05:42,702
- What are you doing? - We'll take it back together.

866
01:05:42,869 --> 01:05:44,621
Stop joking! Give me that!

867
01:05:47,457 --> 01:05:48,416
Here.

868
01:05:48,917 --> 01:05:50,627
You might lose it.

869
01:05:50,794 --> 01:05:53,755
Then I'd be in a real mess. It's so expensive.

870
01:05:59,052 --> 01:06:00,595
Why that look?

871
01:06:00,804 --> 01:06:02,639
You don't think -

872
01:06:02,806 --> 01:06:06,142
I don't think anything, and you're your own boss.

873
01:06:06,309 --> 01:06:08,937
I don't own you. Who am I, anyway?

874
01:06:09,145 --> 01:06:12,315
Just one guy who passed through your life for a moment.

875
01:06:12,482 --> 01:06:14,359
- You mean "one of the many." - I didn't say that.

876
01:06:15,026 --> 01:06:16,987
But you thought it.

877
01:06:17,821 --> 01:06:19,990
Yes, I've had lovers.

878
01:06:20,156 --> 01:06:22,450
Of course. What was I supposed to do?

879
01:06:22,659 --> 01:06:27,330
How do you think I bought all this furniture, my clothes, everything?

880
01:06:27,497 --> 01:06:28,999
With my pay?

881
01:06:29,165 --> 01:06:32,460
It's barely enough for stockings and cigarettes.

882
01:06:32,627 --> 01:06:34,796
I've gotten by like every other woman.

883
01:06:35,005 --> 01:06:36,923
That's life. - Life is what we want it to be.

884
01:06:37,090 --> 01:06:38,508
Words!

885
01:06:38,675 --> 01:06:41,219
Life is filthy and brutal.

886
01:06:41,886 --> 01:06:44,848
I know what poverty is, and it scares me.

887
01:06:45,015 --> 01:06:48,810
Sure, I could have married a streetcar driver

888
01:06:49,519 --> 01:06:52,856
and be starving to death today - me, my children, and him.

889
01:06:54,149 --> 01:06:55,483
Poor Marina.

890
01:06:55,692 --> 01:06:58,236
You think happiness means

891
01:06:58,403 --> 01:07:00,697
a fancy apartment, nice clothes, a maid,

892
01:07:00,864 --> 01:07:02,407
and rich lovers?

893
01:07:02,574 --> 01:07:05,243
If you'd really loved me, you'd have changed me.

894
01:07:05,410 --> 01:07:08,330
But you're just like all the others - no, worse.

895
01:07:08,496 --> 01:07:11,166
At least they don't preach to me.

896
01:07:11,625 --> 01:07:13,543
You're right. Forgive me.

897
01:07:19,883 --> 01:07:23,178
So you had another fight... for a change.

898
01:07:23,386 --> 01:07:25,347
You were eavesdropping, of course.

899
01:07:25,513 --> 01:07:28,266
No, but I heard.

900
01:07:28,433 --> 01:07:30,226
You hear everything here.

901
01:07:36,274 --> 01:07:40,445
We'll go see Don Pietro tomorrow. He offered to hide me

902
01:07:40,612 --> 01:07:42,030
in a monastery.

903
01:07:42,197 --> 01:07:44,491
No, I could never do that.

904
01:07:45,408 --> 01:07:48,036
I have to work harder than ever now.

905
01:07:48,912 --> 01:07:50,538
She's dead.

906
01:07:51,623 --> 01:07:53,458
I understand.

907
01:07:53,625 --> 01:07:56,336
But you're upset right now.

908
01:07:56,503 --> 01:08:00,840
You might act rashly and do more harm than good.

909
01:08:01,007 --> 01:08:03,718
Don't be afraid that time will run out.

910
01:08:05,095 --> 01:08:07,055
It'll be a long fight.

911
01:08:07,472 --> 01:08:09,641
Our battle's barely begun.

912
01:08:14,312 --> 01:08:16,273
I brought you some aspirin.

913
01:08:22,654 --> 01:08:24,406
Good night.

914
01:08:56,730 --> 01:08:57,814
What?

915
01:08:57,981 --> 01:09:02,277
Maybe Manfredi's right. We're real dopes.

916
01:09:02,444 --> 01:09:04,904
Be quiet and go to sleep.

917
01:09:26,926 --> 01:09:30,221
- A man's here to see you. - Show him in.

918
01:09:34,976 --> 01:09:36,561
Come in.

919
01:09:42,359 --> 01:09:45,070
- Hello, Don Pietro. - I was expecting you.

920
01:09:45,528 --> 01:09:47,697
I prepared your ID card.

921
01:09:51,201 --> 01:09:53,078
"Giovanni Episcopo."

922
01:09:53,244 --> 01:09:56,581
You made me two years younger. Thanks.

923
01:09:57,082 --> 01:10:00,835
Who's he? - The Austrian. Didn't Francesco tell you?

924
01:10:01,127 --> 01:10:02,712
A good man.

925
01:10:02,879 --> 01:10:05,924
This gentleman will be coming with us.

926
01:10:06,091 --> 01:10:07,217
Nice to meet you.

927
01:10:07,384 --> 01:10:10,679
I spoke with the prior of the monastery.

928
01:10:10,845 --> 01:10:12,806
He's expecting us. - Where's Francesco?

929
01:10:13,014 --> 01:10:14,891
In the courtyard with Marcello.

930
01:10:15,058 --> 01:10:17,852
We'd better hurry. Hand me my...

931
01:10:18,561 --> 01:10:20,188
After you.

932
01:10:24,276 --> 01:10:26,486
I'll be back late.

933
01:10:26,653 --> 01:10:29,197
When will you stop getting mixed up in these things?

934
01:10:30,240 --> 01:10:32,325
You and the boy go right to bed after dinner.

935
01:10:32,492 --> 01:10:35,203
Who can sleep? Don Pietro?

936
01:10:35,370 --> 01:10:37,372
To feed the boy I'll need...

937
01:10:37,580 --> 01:10:39,207
Oh, right.

938
01:10:42,961 --> 01:10:44,587
Here. That'll be enough.

939
01:10:44,754 --> 01:10:47,007
- You've got nothing left. - Yes, I do.

940
01:10:47,173 --> 01:10:49,259
Sure you do.

941
01:10:49,426 --> 01:10:52,137
We won't see each other for a little while.

942
01:10:52,304 --> 01:10:55,557
But I'll come back, and we'll always be together.

943
01:10:55,724 --> 01:10:58,476
<i>- Let's go. - I'm coming.</i>

944
01:11:10,447 --> 01:11:14,075
You might be cold. Mama gave me this.

945
01:11:32,969 --> 01:11:35,722
Stop! Hands up! Nobody move!

946
01:11:35,889 --> 01:11:37,390
Get in the car!

947
01:11:38,934 --> 01:11:41,269
Get going!

948
01:11:47,067 --> 01:11:48,568
Go on.

949
01:12:11,716 --> 01:12:13,760
The information was accurate.

950
01:12:14,302 --> 01:12:15,637
Well done.

951
01:12:43,623 --> 01:12:46,459
The information was accurate.

952
01:12:46,626 --> 01:12:48,003
Good girl.

953
01:13:08,189 --> 01:13:09,649
You like it?

954
01:13:09,816 --> 01:13:11,276
Try it on.

955
01:13:12,527 --> 01:13:14,112
Go on, darling.

956
01:13:21,828 --> 01:13:23,330
Magnificent!

957
01:13:23,830 --> 01:13:25,665
Take a look.

958
01:13:31,880 --> 01:13:34,257
- Did they arrest him? - Yes.

959
01:13:35,884 --> 01:13:37,802
What will they do to him?

960
01:13:37,969 --> 01:13:40,055
Nothing bad.

961
01:13:40,221 --> 01:13:42,599
We need certain information.

962
01:13:42,766 --> 01:13:45,560
Once he provides it, we'll set him free.

963
01:13:45,852 --> 01:13:48,104
- And if he doesn't? - Don't be silly.

964
01:13:48,271 --> 01:13:50,023
Don't worry.

965
01:13:50,357 --> 01:13:51,733
He'll talk.

966
01:13:52,025 --> 01:13:55,236
- And if he doesn't? - Why wouldn't he?

967
01:13:57,238 --> 01:13:59,574
You're right. Why wouldn't he?

968
01:14:01,785 --> 01:14:03,745
- You love him? - Me?

969
01:14:04,621 --> 01:14:06,414
I don't love anyone.

970
01:14:13,672 --> 01:14:16,174
Why so mean to me tonight?

971
01:14:16,341 --> 01:14:17,592
Let me leave.

972
01:14:17,759 --> 01:14:20,929
No, you're staying here with me.

973
01:14:22,138 --> 01:14:25,100
No, no more! Let me leave!

974
01:14:27,143 --> 01:14:28,520
Why?

975
01:14:30,188 --> 01:14:32,440
What have I done?

976
01:14:32,649 --> 01:14:34,734
What have I done?

977
01:14:42,450 --> 01:14:43,910
What number?

978
01:14:44,452 --> 01:14:45,787
Forty.

979
01:14:46,997 --> 01:14:48,373
Here.

980
01:15:02,345 --> 01:15:03,805
Go on!

981
01:15:14,232 --> 01:15:15,859
Are you hurt?

982
01:15:18,069 --> 01:15:20,447
- My glasses. - They're broken.

983
01:15:24,659 --> 01:15:26,119
Doesn't matter.

984
01:15:32,667 --> 01:15:36,004
It's all my fault. They must have been tailing me.

985
01:15:36,212 --> 01:15:38,381
On the contrary.

986
01:15:39,215 --> 01:15:42,344
They've probably been watching me for a long time.

987
01:15:42,510 --> 01:15:44,471
I shouldn't have had you come to the church.

988
01:15:44,679 --> 01:15:46,932
Quiet! The walls have ears.

989
01:15:47,098 --> 01:15:50,435
Let 'em listen. We have nothing to tell.

990
01:15:51,269 --> 01:15:53,563
Right, Don Pietro? - Of course.

991
01:15:54,481 --> 01:15:56,441
We have nothing to tell.

992
01:15:58,985 --> 01:16:00,445
Hear that?

993
01:16:00,612 --> 01:16:02,989
We'll scream like that too!

994
01:16:06,076 --> 01:16:07,535
Take it easy.

995
01:16:08,745 --> 01:16:12,290
This was found at the priest's residence, sir.

996
01:16:13,166 --> 01:16:16,336
And these are the prisoners' documents - all forged, of course.

997
01:16:16,503 --> 01:16:19,756
- You searched the priest's rooms? - Yes, and the sacristy too.

998
01:16:19,923 --> 01:16:21,466
That wasn't smart.

999
01:16:21,675 --> 01:16:25,387
There was only a sexton and a young boy there, sir.

1000
01:16:25,595 --> 01:16:29,057
They were so scared that I'm sure they won't talk.

1001
01:16:29,432 --> 01:16:32,018
Rest assured, they'll talk. Thanks.

1002
01:16:35,897 --> 01:16:37,524
Straighten up here.

1003
01:16:44,948 --> 01:16:46,491
Aren't you afraid?

1004
01:16:46,658 --> 01:16:50,120
Yes, very afraid, but I feel very calm too.

1005
01:16:50,370 --> 01:16:53,415
Strange, isn't it? I don't know why, but I -

1006
01:16:53,581 --> 01:16:55,208
I understand.

1007
01:16:55,583 --> 01:16:58,420
You're both crazy!

1008
01:16:59,462 --> 01:17:01,172
Listen to me.

1009
01:17:01,673 --> 01:17:04,634
I know you must have something to hide.

1010
01:17:04,801 --> 01:17:08,054
Lives depend on your silence.

1011
01:17:08,722 --> 01:17:11,641
You think you can withstand their torture.

1012
01:17:12,058 --> 01:17:13,643
But you don't know.

1013
01:17:13,810 --> 01:17:17,272
They turn even heroes into cowards.

1014
01:17:17,480 --> 01:17:18,815
We're not heroes,

1015
01:17:18,982 --> 01:17:22,777
but they'll never find out anything, I assure you.

1016
01:17:22,986 --> 01:17:25,488
- What time is it? - 8:30, sir.

1017
01:17:28,325 --> 01:17:31,328
These men must talk before the curfew is up.

1018
01:17:31,494 --> 01:17:34,748
The rebels must not learn of their arrest.

1019
01:17:34,914 --> 01:17:37,626
We have ten hours.

1020
01:17:47,761 --> 01:17:49,304
Listen, Don Pietro.

1021
01:17:50,305 --> 01:17:55,310
I don't know if we'll see each other again,

1022
01:17:55,518 --> 01:18:00,190
but thanks for all you've done for me, for all of us.

1023
01:18:00,357 --> 01:18:02,484
No, let me finish. I must tell you the truth.

1024
01:18:02,692 --> 01:18:05,028
I'm not who you think I am -

1025
01:18:05,195 --> 01:18:06,738
Listen.

1026
01:18:07,322 --> 01:18:08,281
They're coming.

1027
01:18:08,490 --> 01:18:11,326
I beg you, don't betray me!

1028
01:18:14,746 --> 01:18:16,039
You!

1029
01:18:29,886 --> 01:18:32,222
Krammer, put out the light.

1030
01:18:36,268 --> 01:18:37,269
Come in.

1031
01:18:53,243 --> 01:18:54,494
Please.

1032
01:18:58,373 --> 01:19:00,208
What's your name?

1033
01:19:00,917 --> 01:19:02,377
Giovanni Episcopo.

1034
01:19:03,003 --> 01:19:04,254
Right.

1035
01:19:05,547 --> 01:19:08,675
"Born in Bari. Merchant."

1036
01:19:09,092 --> 01:19:11,511
What do you sell? - Oil and wine.

1037
01:19:11,928 --> 01:19:15,890
Oil and wine! Splendid!

1038
01:19:17,058 --> 01:19:19,060
Listen, Mr. Episcopo...

1039
01:19:20,270 --> 01:19:22,272
if I had time to waste,

1040
01:19:22,439 --> 01:19:25,734
I'd love to discuss your business with you.

1041
01:19:25,900 --> 01:19:29,404
But I'm pressed for time, and I regard you very highly,

1042
01:19:29,613 --> 01:19:32,115
so I'll make you an offer.

1043
01:19:32,616 --> 01:19:34,242
I know all about you:

1044
01:19:34,451 --> 01:19:37,746
Your real name and past political activity.

1045
01:19:37,954 --> 01:19:40,790
As for the present, I know from my informers

1046
01:19:40,957 --> 01:19:47,964
that you're a leader of the National Liberation Committee

1047
01:19:48,131 --> 01:19:51,676
and in contact with Badoglio's men.

1048
01:19:52,093 --> 01:19:59,017
I absolutely must learn the details of this organization,

1049
01:19:59,184 --> 01:20:01,436
and you're just the man to tell me about it.

1050
01:20:01,645 --> 01:20:03,271
You say you know who I am

1051
01:20:03,480 --> 01:20:06,733
and my past and present activities.

1052
01:20:07,150 --> 01:20:09,486
Then why make this offer?

1053
01:20:09,653 --> 01:20:12,030
Think I'd suddenly turn traitor?

1054
01:20:12,656 --> 01:20:15,909
I know you've made the same offer,

1055
01:20:16,076 --> 01:20:18,536
possibly in this very room, to Italian generals -

1056
01:20:18,703 --> 01:20:20,830
"Badoglio's men," as you call them.

1057
01:20:21,414 --> 01:20:25,669
And I know they paid for their loyalty and silence with their lives.

1058
01:20:25,835 --> 01:20:27,963
I hope I prove equal to them.

1059
01:20:28,171 --> 01:20:32,592
I'm sorry to see you refuse such a reasonable offer.

1060
01:20:33,176 --> 01:20:35,679
But I must say I expected it.

1061
01:20:36,304 --> 01:20:40,767
You Italians, no matter your party, have a weakness for rhetoric.

1062
01:20:43,353 --> 01:20:46,856
But I'm sure we'll come to an agreement before dawn.

1063
01:20:47,023 --> 01:20:48,650
Cigarette?

1064
01:20:49,067 --> 01:20:52,404
Come now. A cigarette won't make you talk.

1065
01:20:53,905 --> 01:20:57,867
There are so many strange rumors about the Gestapo.

1066
01:21:01,913 --> 01:21:04,624
Krammer, take him away.

1067
01:21:24,603 --> 01:21:26,396
Bring in the priest.

1068
01:21:31,359 --> 01:21:32,611
You!

1069
01:21:37,657 --> 01:21:39,701
Be calm, my son.

1070
01:21:40,535 --> 01:21:42,287
Try to pray.

1071
01:22:18,949 --> 01:22:22,369
We found these materials in your rooms.

1072
01:22:24,788 --> 01:22:29,334
You clearly aim to harm the Reich and its armed forces.

1073
01:22:30,168 --> 01:22:32,379
That wasn't exactly my aim.

1074
01:22:32,545 --> 01:22:35,382
Then what would you call a man who not only provides

1075
01:22:35,548 --> 01:22:38,093
refuge and forged documents

1076
01:22:38,301 --> 01:22:40,929
to Italians plotting attacks on our soldiers

1077
01:22:41,096 --> 01:22:44,849
but even shelters German deserters?

1078
01:22:45,225 --> 01:22:48,353
A man who humbly seeks to practice charity.

1079
01:22:48,728 --> 01:22:51,273
He's a traitor who must punished

1080
01:22:51,481 --> 01:22:54,276
subject to the military law of the Reich.

1081
01:22:54,818 --> 01:22:56,319
God will judge.

1082
01:22:56,653 --> 01:22:59,197
Listen to me carefully.

1083
01:22:59,739 --> 01:23:03,743
Your friend Episcopo heads a military organization

1084
01:23:03,910 --> 01:23:06,913
of which you too have detailed knowledge.

1085
01:23:07,080 --> 01:23:08,623
If you talk,

1086
01:23:08,790 --> 01:23:11,960
or persuade your friend to do the same,

1087
01:23:12,127 --> 01:23:16,214
you'll have merely done your duty as priest and citizen.

1088
01:23:16,381 --> 01:23:17,841
I'll tell you why.

1089
01:23:18,341 --> 01:23:23,763
These men plotting to sabotage German armed forces

1090
01:23:23,972 --> 01:23:26,933
are violating the rights of an occupying power

1091
01:23:27,100 --> 01:23:29,728
guaranteed by international treaties.

1092
01:23:29,894 --> 01:23:32,606
They are therefore defectors

1093
01:23:32,772 --> 01:23:36,026
subject to military justice. Is that clear?

1094
01:23:36,901 --> 01:23:39,029
Your words have moved me deeply.

1095
01:23:39,195 --> 01:23:40,655
Finally!

1096
01:23:40,822 --> 01:23:42,240
Krammer...

1097
01:23:42,407 --> 01:23:44,200
take his statement.

1098
01:23:45,702 --> 01:23:48,330
- There's just one problem. - What?

1099
01:23:48,538 --> 01:23:51,583
Personally I have nothing to say. I know nothing.

1100
01:23:51,750 --> 01:23:54,586
What little I know I learned in the confessional,

1101
01:23:54,753 --> 01:23:58,006
and those secrets must die with me. It's our vow.

1102
01:23:58,506 --> 01:24:01,009
I'm not interested in your vow!

1103
01:24:01,176 --> 01:24:05,055
But someone else is, someone higher than you... and me.

1104
01:24:05,347 --> 01:24:07,724
Then persuade your friend to talk.

1105
01:24:07,891 --> 01:24:11,019
I don't think he has the information you seek.

1106
01:24:11,186 --> 01:24:13,647
You'd have me believe that you don't know

1107
01:24:13,855 --> 01:24:17,734
what he really does, who he really is?

1108
01:24:19,069 --> 01:24:22,989
I only know he's a man in need of my modest help.

1109
01:24:23,156 --> 01:24:26,952
Really? Then I'll tell you who he is.

1110
01:24:27,118 --> 01:24:31,122
He's a subversive, an atheist - your enemy!

1111
01:24:32,207 --> 01:24:34,376
I am a Catholic priest.

1112
01:24:34,793 --> 01:24:37,796
I believe that anyone fighting for justice and liberty

1113
01:24:37,963 --> 01:24:40,131
walks in the ways of the Lord,

1114
01:24:40,298 --> 01:24:43,343
and the ways of the Lord are infinite.

1115
01:24:43,885 --> 01:24:46,012
I hope you're not going to preach to me!

1116
01:24:47,180 --> 01:24:48,807
That's not my intention.

1117
01:24:52,727 --> 01:24:57,399
I have no time to lose. Do you refuse to talk?

1118
01:25:00,318 --> 01:25:04,906
And you won't even try to persuade your companion?

1119
01:25:05,573 --> 01:25:08,243
You could save him from suffering

1120
01:25:08,451 --> 01:25:11,454
that you can't even imagine.

1121
01:25:11,788 --> 01:25:14,624
I can imagine it far better than you think.

1122
01:25:15,041 --> 01:25:17,294
But there'd be no point.

1123
01:25:17,460 --> 01:25:19,504
And if he is who you say,

1124
01:25:19,671 --> 01:25:22,215
he wouldn't be easily persuaded, would he?

1125
01:25:22,590 --> 01:25:25,802
Don't worry. He'll talk.

1126
01:25:25,969 --> 01:25:28,597
I don't think so. He won't talk.

1127
01:25:28,805 --> 01:25:31,433
- Really? - He won't talk.

1128
01:25:32,934 --> 01:25:34,394
I'll pray for him.

1129
01:25:34,561 --> 01:25:39,357
You won't get much credit for that from your heavenly father!

1130
01:26:19,022 --> 01:26:20,649
This will take a while.

1131
01:26:20,857 --> 01:26:23,944
Come get me as soon as there's any news.

1132
01:26:24,444 --> 01:26:25,278
Come in.

1133
01:26:28,573 --> 01:26:31,034
The deserter hanged himself, sir.

1134
01:26:31,201 --> 01:26:32,744
That idiot!

1135
01:27:23,169 --> 01:27:25,797
- Who's winning? - Same as always.

1136
01:27:45,942 --> 01:27:48,862
- Strenuous evening? - Not very...

1137
01:27:49,446 --> 01:27:50,697
but interesting.

1138
01:27:50,864 --> 01:27:52,574
Really? How so?

1139
01:27:52,741 --> 01:27:55,577
I have a fellow who must talk before morning,

1140
01:27:56,411 --> 01:27:58,663
and an Italian priest who claims the fellow won't

1141
01:27:58,830 --> 01:28:00,790
because he's praying for him.

1142
01:28:00,957 --> 01:28:02,917
- And if he doesn't talk? - Ridiculous.

1143
01:28:03,084 --> 01:28:05,086
If he won't talk no matter what?

1144
01:28:05,253 --> 01:28:09,758
That would mean an Italian is as good as a German...

1145
01:28:10,550 --> 01:28:12,969
that there's no difference

1146
01:28:13,136 --> 01:28:17,474
between the blood of a slave race and that of a master race.

1147
01:28:21,603 --> 01:28:24,230
What would be the sense of our struggle?

1148
01:28:24,397 --> 01:28:28,318
Twenty-five years ago I led execution squads in France.

1149
01:28:28,485 --> 01:28:30,445
I was a young officer then...

1150
01:28:31,488 --> 01:28:34,282
and I too believed that we Germans were a master race.

1151
01:28:34,491 --> 01:28:38,453
But the French patriots chose to die rather than talk.

1152
01:28:38,662 --> 01:28:42,582
We Germans refuse to realize that people want to be free.

1153
01:28:42,958 --> 01:28:46,211
- Hartmann, you're drunk! - Yes, I am.

1154
01:28:46,795 --> 01:28:48,755
I drink every night to forget.

1155
01:28:48,922 --> 01:28:52,050
But instead I see more and more clearly.

1156
01:28:52,425 --> 01:28:54,427
All we're really good at

1157
01:28:54,594 --> 01:28:56,763
is killing, killing, killing!

1158
01:28:58,348 --> 01:29:01,017
We've strewn all of Europe with corpses,

1159
01:29:01,851 --> 01:29:06,273
and from their graves rises up an unquenchable hatred.

1160
01:29:06,439 --> 01:29:09,401
Hatred... hatred everywhere!

1161
01:29:10,277 --> 01:29:13,989
That hatred will devour us. There's no hope.

1162
01:29:14,197 --> 01:29:14,948
Enough!

1163
01:29:15,365 --> 01:29:18,994
We'll all die without the slightest hope.

1164
01:29:19,494 --> 01:29:21,788
I forbid you to continue!

1165
01:29:23,623 --> 01:29:24,791
Without hope.

1166
01:29:24,958 --> 01:29:27,544
You hear me? You forget that you are

1167
01:29:27,711 --> 01:29:29,337
a German officer!

1168
01:29:34,843 --> 01:29:36,511
- Did he talk? - No, sir.

1169
01:29:36,678 --> 01:29:39,306
Wendel says he's never seen one so stubborn.

1170
01:29:39,472 --> 01:29:41,433
The man's gone completely numb.

1171
01:29:41,600 --> 01:29:43,602
What should we do now, sir?

1172
01:30:00,327 --> 01:30:03,121
- Well? - It's impossible, sir.

1173
01:30:03,288 --> 01:30:05,749
We have to let him regain some strength.

1174
01:30:05,915 --> 01:30:07,792
Impossible! It's too late for that.

1175
01:30:07,959 --> 01:30:10,754
Shall we try psychological methods, sir?

1176
01:30:10,920 --> 01:30:14,215
Are you crazy? He must talk now.

1177
01:30:26,728 --> 01:30:28,188
Syringe.

1178
01:30:56,007 --> 01:30:59,970
Mr. Ferraris, as I said before, I admire you greatly,

1179
01:31:00,136 --> 01:31:03,306
and I do appreciate this proof of your courage

1180
01:31:03,473 --> 01:31:05,642
and spirit of sacrifice.

1181
01:31:05,809 --> 01:31:09,396
But you must understand: This can't go on.

1182
01:31:09,562 --> 01:31:11,606
You are a Communist.

1183
01:31:11,815 --> 01:31:16,945
Your party has formed a pact with reactionary forces.

1184
01:31:17,362 --> 01:31:20,407
You're all working together against us now.

1185
01:31:20,657 --> 01:31:23,994
But tomorrow, when Rome is occupied -

1186
01:31:24,452 --> 01:31:27,414
or "liberated," as you call it -

1187
01:31:27,580 --> 01:31:31,835
will these monarchist officers still be your allies?

1188
01:31:32,585 --> 01:31:34,879
I offer you the solution to this problem.

1189
01:31:36,172 --> 01:31:38,675
Give me the names of Badoglio's generals.

1190
01:31:38,842 --> 01:31:41,136
Help me arrest them,

1191
01:31:41,303 --> 01:31:43,722
and I guarantee your release

1192
01:31:43,888 --> 01:31:46,558
and immunity for the men in your party.

1193
01:31:47,517 --> 01:31:49,311
Well, Mr. Ferraris?

1194
01:31:49,686 --> 01:31:51,479
Cursed dog!

1195
01:31:53,440 --> 01:31:55,066
Keep at him till the end!

1196
01:32:46,201 --> 01:32:47,535
How's it going?

1197
01:32:47,744 --> 01:32:50,747
I told you it wouldn't be so easy.

1198
01:33:32,038 --> 01:33:33,581
A cigarette.

1199
01:34:02,694 --> 01:34:04,362
The priest, quick!

1200
01:34:12,329 --> 01:34:15,123
Look, priest! Satisfied now?

1201
01:34:15,290 --> 01:34:16,916
This is your Christian charity.

1202
01:34:17,083 --> 01:34:19,919
This is your love for your brother in Christ.

1203
01:34:20,086 --> 01:34:23,173
You preferred to see him like this rather than talk.

1204
01:34:23,340 --> 01:34:27,260
But don't think you'll save yourself, you hypocrite,

1205
01:34:27,427 --> 01:34:30,305
or your accomplices either. You'll die a traitor's death.

1206
01:34:30,847 --> 01:34:32,474
We'll destroy you all,

1207
01:34:32,682 --> 01:34:34,726
to the last man!

1208
01:34:35,644 --> 01:34:37,395
You didn't talk.

1209
01:35:20,772 --> 01:35:23,275
It is finished.

1210
01:35:24,901 --> 01:35:28,071
You tried to destroy his soul, but you only destroyed his body!

1211
01:35:28,613 --> 01:35:29,823
Curse you all!

1212
01:35:30,323 --> 01:35:31,283
Curse you all!

1213
01:35:32,826 --> 01:35:34,703
You'll be trampled in the dust like worms!

1214
01:35:35,161 --> 01:35:36,121
Curse you all!

1215
01:35:44,921 --> 01:35:46,381
My God...

1216
01:35:47,257 --> 01:35:49,259
what have I said?

1217
01:35:50,260 --> 01:35:54,014
Forgive me, Lord.

1218
01:36:16,578 --> 01:36:17,537
Out!

1219
01:36:17,704 --> 01:36:19,372
Take the priest back!

1220
01:36:19,539 --> 01:36:21,708
Everybody out, now!

1221
01:36:22,334 --> 01:36:24,377
Stupid Italians!

1222
01:36:25,503 --> 01:36:28,548
Damn it! We failed.

1223
01:36:28,715 --> 01:36:30,675
That damned priest got me flustered.

1224
01:36:30,842 --> 01:36:33,011
I told you it wouldn't be easy.

1225
01:36:33,178 --> 01:36:35,347
You're always right.

1226
01:36:35,513 --> 01:36:37,349
The report, sir?

1227
01:36:37,515 --> 01:36:40,352
Ah, yes. "Cause of death:

1228
01:36:41,436 --> 01:36:43,063
Heart attack."

1229
01:36:43,563 --> 01:36:45,315
Yes, sir. And the young woman?

1230
01:36:45,649 --> 01:36:46,900
That's up to the lady.

1231
01:36:47,067 --> 01:36:49,486
Lock her up a while and then -

1232
01:36:49,653 --> 01:36:52,030
Come, my dear. I need a stiff drink.

1233
01:36:52,197 --> 01:36:55,241
Sir, what name shall I put down?

1234
01:36:55,533 --> 01:36:57,035
Manfredi or Ferraris?

1235
01:36:57,202 --> 01:37:00,455
Giovanni Episcopo.

1236
01:37:00,664 --> 01:37:03,917
Else we create another martyr, and they already have plenty.

1237
01:37:04,084 --> 01:37:05,335
Just a moment.

1238
01:37:19,015 --> 01:37:20,642
For next time.

1239
01:37:22,686 --> 01:37:24,813
We are a master race...

1240
01:37:33,321 --> 01:37:35,699
- What time do you have? - 8:14.

1241
01:37:35,865 --> 01:37:39,035
- Exactly. They're late. - Yes.

1242
01:37:39,202 --> 01:37:41,496
- Cigarette? - Thanks.

1243
01:37:46,710 --> 01:37:47,669
A match.

1244
01:38:08,440 --> 01:38:11,234
Positions!

1245
01:38:15,530 --> 01:38:16,990
Get ready.

1246
01:38:24,247 --> 01:38:25,707
Attention!

1247
01:38:49,189 --> 01:38:50,899
Your hat.

1248
01:39:03,995 --> 01:39:05,872
Come. Be brave.

1249
01:39:06,122 --> 01:39:09,834
Oh, it's not hard to die a good death.

1250
01:39:10,627 --> 01:39:13,088
What's hard is to live a good life.

1251
01:40:29,456 --> 01:40:30,081
Fire!

1252
01:40:30,332 --> 01:40:32,751
God, forgive them...

1253
01:40:33,251 --> 01:40:34,794
End this now!
