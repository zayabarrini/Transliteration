Directed by Kenji Mizoguchi

18
00:02:14,400 --> 00:02:18,666
This tale is set...

19
00:02:23,510 --> 00:02:27,674
...during the late Heian period...

20
00:02:28,014 --> 00:02:32,178
...an era when mankind...

21
00:02:32,519 --> 00:02:36,649
...had not yet awakened as human beings.

22
00:02:36,990 --> 00:02:41,154
It has been retold
by the people for centuries...

23
00:02:41,494 --> 00:02:45,658
...and it is treasured today...

24
00:02:45,999 --> 00:02:50,163
...as one of the world's great folk tales,
full of grief...

25
00:03:20,333 --> 00:03:22,927
Zushio, be careful.

26
00:03:23,136 --> 00:03:24,797
Okay.

27
00:03:39,385 --> 00:03:41,046
Mother.

28
00:03:41,421 --> 00:03:42,615
What is it?

29
00:03:42,822 --> 00:03:48,385
How did Father end up
in a faraway place like Tsukushi?

30
00:03:52,365 --> 00:03:55,425
Father is a great man, isn't he?

31
00:03:56,102 --> 00:03:58,070
Certainly.

32
00:03:58,271 --> 00:04:00,603
He is a righteous and fine man.

33
00:04:00,807 --> 00:04:02,502
That's what I thought!

34
00:04:03,009 --> 00:04:05,102
Father!

35
00:04:05,311 --> 00:04:07,711
Father!

36
00:04:18,191 --> 00:04:19,954
Zushio-sama!

37
00:04:20,159 --> 00:04:21,751
Zushio!

38
00:04:34,207 --> 00:04:36,607
Don't be violent! Step back, all of you!

39
00:04:36,809 --> 00:04:39,175
We didn't come here to fight.

40
00:04:39,379 --> 00:04:40,607
We're here to appeal.

41
00:04:40,813 --> 00:04:43,008
Then, please, calm down!

42
00:04:43,216 --> 00:04:46,344
Are you the general?

43
00:04:46,552 --> 00:04:51,080
Master, please come out!
We're all here for you!

44
00:04:51,291 --> 00:04:55,591
- What are you going to do?
- We'll have master's transfer cancelled!

45
00:04:55,795 --> 00:04:59,162
The transfer is just a pretense.
It means exile!

46
00:04:59,365 --> 00:05:01,993
What kind of nonsense is that?

47
00:05:02,201 --> 00:05:06,228
He is being punished because of us!
We can't just stand by and watch!

48
00:05:06,606 --> 00:05:09,200
Let's all go to the general's office
and appeal!

49
00:05:09,542 --> 00:05:13,069
Wait! I know you care for our master.

50
00:05:13,279 --> 00:05:17,648
But what you want to do will only
make his situation more difficult!

51
00:05:17,850 --> 00:05:19,875
Be sensible and listen to us.

52
00:05:20,420 --> 00:05:25,050
For 13 years, famine has caused
suffering for all of you.

53
00:05:25,258 --> 00:05:29,922
You need every working hand
you have.

54
00:05:31,064 --> 00:05:36,001
That was why our master opposed
the general's demand...

55
00:05:36,202 --> 00:05:39,433
...for more men to fight his war
and the increase of taxes on rice.

56
00:05:40,306 --> 00:05:43,901
His attempt to help you was overruled.

57
00:05:44,110 --> 00:05:50,071
If you do this now,
you too will be punished!

58
00:05:50,283 --> 00:05:55,414
That's right!
If you riot, he will be blamed!

59
00:05:55,621 --> 00:05:57,521
He will be accused of rebellion!

60
00:05:57,724 --> 00:06:01,216
So, please, return to your homes!

61
00:06:04,530 --> 00:06:09,297
You're too lenient on them!
This is a riot!

62
00:06:09,502 --> 00:06:10,867
Kill them all!

63
00:06:11,070 --> 00:06:15,598
What are you saying?
I do not approve of that!

64
00:06:17,910 --> 00:06:21,141
Keep out of this.
You are no longer governor.

65
00:06:21,948 --> 00:06:24,508
How dare you speak that way!

66
00:07:24,544 --> 00:07:26,375
Zushio-sama.

67
00:07:29,615 --> 00:07:31,048
Your food is ready.

68
00:07:57,643 --> 00:08:00,635
I am sorry to have caused
you trouble, Uncle.

69
00:08:00,847 --> 00:08:07,013
You've involved the whole family.
Your wife and children are in pain.

70
00:08:07,820 --> 00:08:11,483
The peasants are in pain as well.

71
00:08:11,691 --> 00:08:12,885
Nonsense!

72
00:08:13,493 --> 00:08:17,020
You cannot compare us to peasants!

73
00:08:17,663 --> 00:08:19,494
You fool!

74
00:08:31,711 --> 00:08:36,739
Tamaki. Take the children to
your parents' home in Iwashiro.

75
00:08:37,250 --> 00:08:38,512
Yes.

76
00:08:38,885 --> 00:08:41,149
Tell them I am sorry...

77
00:08:41,654 --> 00:08:45,750
...for disappointing them
after they put their trust in me.

78
00:08:48,027 --> 00:08:53,488
Zushio, I wonder if you'll become
a stubborn man like me.

79
00:08:55,902 --> 00:09:00,669
You may be too young to understand,
but hear me out anyway.

80
00:09:02,041 --> 00:09:05,704
Without mercy,
man is like a beast.

81
00:09:05,912 --> 00:09:06,970
Yes.

82
00:09:07,179 --> 00:09:10,774
Even if you are hard on yourself,
be merciful to others.

83
00:09:11,150 --> 00:09:14,551
Men are created equal.

84
00:09:14,754 --> 00:09:17,985
Everyone is entitled
to their happiness.

85
00:09:38,411 --> 00:09:41,380
This is the goddess of mercy, Kwannon.
A family treasure.

86
00:09:41,914 --> 00:09:44,382
Think of this as my principle.

87
00:09:46,085 --> 00:09:50,613
Keep it in remembrance of me.
Always keep it with you. Understand?

88
00:09:50,823 --> 00:09:52,381
Yes.

89
00:09:52,825 --> 00:09:56,625
Now repeat what I've just told you.

90
00:09:56,829 --> 00:10:01,425
"A man is not a human being
without mercy.

91
00:10:01,634 --> 00:10:05,968
Even if you are hard on yourself,
be merciful to others."

92
00:10:19,619 --> 00:10:24,181
"Men are created equal.

93
00:10:24,690 --> 00:10:27,454
Everyone is entitled
to their happiness."

94
00:10:31,530 --> 00:10:36,797
- Do you remember your father's face?
- Yes, Mother.

95
00:10:37,603 --> 00:10:42,631
- And his teachings also?
- Yes.

96
00:11:16,642 --> 00:11:22,103
Zushio, it is time
to say goodbye to your father.

97
00:11:24,216 --> 00:11:28,482
Anju, become a lovely lady.

98
00:11:31,023 --> 00:11:34,754
- Look after your sister.
- Yes, Father.

99
00:11:43,736 --> 00:11:46,864
We are not parting forever.

100
00:11:47,473 --> 00:11:50,306
Be hopeful and brave.

101
00:11:50,509 --> 00:11:51,908
Yes.

102
00:11:54,780 --> 00:11:59,547
I never dreamed
I would have to leave this place.

103
00:12:13,365 --> 00:12:17,665
- Governor!
- Master!

104
00:13:35,181 --> 00:13:40,710
Come, we must hurry.
We have to find a place to stay.

105
00:13:50,362 --> 00:13:53,388
Zushio, Anju...

106
00:13:53,599 --> 00:13:57,365
...we are taking the same road
your father took.

107
00:14:01,040 --> 00:14:02,598
Father.

108
00:14:14,787 --> 00:14:18,621
<i>My lady! My lady!</i>

109
00:14:23,529 --> 00:14:27,625
There are no lodgings available
in this area.

110
00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:30,298
Why is that?

111
00:14:30,502 --> 00:14:34,404
There have been bandits and slave
dealers posing as travelers recently.

112
00:14:34,640 --> 00:14:38,041
They have been killing and
kidnapping women and children...

113
00:14:38,244 --> 00:14:42,977
...so the governor has prohibited
sheltering travelers.

114
00:14:44,316 --> 00:14:46,614
Bandits and slave dealers?

115
00:15:00,165 --> 00:15:04,534
- We are in trouble.
- What shall we do?

116
00:15:04,737 --> 00:15:09,504
We have no choice
other than to find a place to camp.

117
00:15:09,708 --> 00:15:12,040
Camp, my lady?

118
00:15:12,244 --> 00:15:18,547
We must build a shelter
before it gets too dark.

119
00:15:19,351 --> 00:15:22,286
Zushio, Anju, you must help too.

120
00:15:22,488 --> 00:15:24,479
- Yes.
- Yes.

121
00:15:55,487 --> 00:15:57,045
Here.

122
00:16:03,996 --> 00:16:06,794
Mother, shall I go get more?

123
00:16:06,999 --> 00:16:12,631
Yes, more thatch and soft grass
would be nice.

124
00:16:13,439 --> 00:16:16,169
- Come, Anju.
- Yes.

125
00:16:52,978 --> 00:16:55,674
Brother, we should get this branch.

126
00:16:55,881 --> 00:16:58,509
You can't break it by yourself, Anju.

127
00:17:11,430 --> 00:17:13,125
Mother is calling us.

128
00:17:13,332 --> 00:17:16,699
- It's the sound of the waves.
- No, listen carefully.

129
00:17:19,204 --> 00:17:25,040
Anju, come back quickly!

130
00:17:27,713 --> 00:17:30,511
Zushio!

131
00:17:32,017 --> 00:17:34,952
Anju!

132
00:17:48,167 --> 00:17:53,571
You two must be hungry.
This will help.

133
00:17:59,378 --> 00:18:02,905
- What was that?
- Wolves, my lady.

134
00:18:04,116 --> 00:18:08,883
Do not worry.
They will not come near the fire.

135
00:18:09,088 --> 00:18:12,387
Don't worry, dear. It'll be all right.

136
00:18:25,437 --> 00:18:30,431
I'm sorry
we don't have any warm food.

137
00:18:37,616 --> 00:18:42,212
I will try to go get some porridge
from a house nearby.

138
00:18:42,855 --> 00:18:47,121
And some bedding for sleeping.

139
00:18:49,194 --> 00:18:51,253
I'll be right back.

140
00:18:52,097 --> 00:18:54,190
Thank you.

141
00:19:41,914 --> 00:19:43,506
Who's there?

142
00:19:50,822 --> 00:19:53,882
What on earth are you doing here?

143
00:19:54,993 --> 00:19:58,554
We are travelers.

144
00:19:58,764 --> 00:20:01,858
We could not find any lodging.

145
00:20:03,602 --> 00:20:06,935
I'm very sorry to hear that.

146
00:20:07,139 --> 00:20:11,838
The cold night is harmful to children.

147
00:20:14,546 --> 00:20:19,643
Come to my place.
I can give you warm porridge.

148
00:20:19,851 --> 00:20:25,619
I appreciate your kindness,
but I would not want to intrude.

149
00:20:25,824 --> 00:20:28,952
Just come quietly.

150
00:20:29,161 --> 00:20:33,564
Even if the authorities find out,
I'm sure they'll allow one night.

151
00:20:33,765 --> 00:20:37,997
- Come, quickly.
- Thank you...

152
00:20:38,203 --> 00:20:40,763
...but there is
one more person with us.

153
00:20:40,973 --> 00:20:42,736
Another person?

154
00:20:43,775 --> 00:20:48,041
Is this person a man or a woman?

155
00:20:48,247 --> 00:20:51,842
She is a woman. Our servant.

156
00:20:52,050 --> 00:20:55,213
Then it's all right.

157
00:20:55,420 --> 00:20:59,516
I can't have a man
staying with a priestess.

158
00:21:02,494 --> 00:21:07,363
I was able to get straw mats,
but could not get any food, my lady.

159
00:21:07,566 --> 00:21:10,694
It's all right. This priestess here...

160
00:21:10,902 --> 00:21:14,235
...has graciously offered to lodge us
secretly for the night.

161
00:21:14,439 --> 00:21:19,035
- Really?
- Now, then, let's go.

162
00:21:19,244 --> 00:21:24,546
Thank you so much.
I am so happy. Thank you so much.

163
00:21:32,391 --> 00:21:35,087
I can never thank you enough
for your kindness.

164
00:21:35,294 --> 00:21:41,665
It is nothing. I do not live my life
only to serve the gods.

165
00:21:41,933 --> 00:21:45,425
No, really. Even family cannot help us.

166
00:21:46,738 --> 00:21:49,138
It is a cold world.

167
00:21:53,445 --> 00:21:59,543
So you stayed at your brother's
in Iwashiro for six years?

168
00:21:59,885 --> 00:22:01,079
Yes.

169
00:22:01,286 --> 00:22:07,247
Marriage will break apart
even siblings, I guess.

170
00:22:07,626 --> 00:22:12,620
With their stomachs full, the
children have selfishly fallen asleep.

171
00:22:19,571 --> 00:22:23,837
And what are your plans for travel?

172
00:22:25,277 --> 00:22:28,838
It is impossible to walk.
Why don't you go by boat?

173
00:22:29,047 --> 00:22:31,845
There are hard roads ahead.

174
00:22:32,050 --> 00:22:36,214
Also, there are many bandits
lurking around the mountains.

175
00:22:36,421 --> 00:22:38,286
Is going by boat safe?

176
00:22:38,490 --> 00:22:43,052
Certainly. I know reliable boatmen.

177
00:22:43,261 --> 00:22:46,287
- I will ask them for you.
- Thank you.

178
00:22:51,670 --> 00:22:57,836
I made all the arrangements
while you were asleep.

179
00:22:58,210 --> 00:23:03,477
- How can we ever thank you?
- It was nothing.

180
00:23:23,135 --> 00:23:28,038
Thank you. Here they are.
Please take care of them.

181
00:23:28,240 --> 00:23:31,004
Thank you for accepting them.

182
00:23:31,209 --> 00:23:33,541
Come this way.

183
00:23:48,326 --> 00:23:50,590
Here you are.

184
00:23:51,196 --> 00:23:53,255
Please get on the boat.

185
00:23:53,465 --> 00:23:56,298
I'll never forget your kindness.

186
00:23:56,501 --> 00:23:59,527
Zushio, Anju, say goodbye.

187
00:23:59,738 --> 00:24:01,831
- Thank you very much.
- Farewell.

188
00:24:02,040 --> 00:24:08,172
Farewell. I'll be praying
for your safe voyage.

189
00:24:08,380 --> 00:24:09,677
Thank you very much.

190
00:24:09,881 --> 00:24:12,281
Now, lady. You go first.

191
00:24:23,595 --> 00:24:26,393
Anju-sama. Zushio-sama.
Go ahead and get in.

192
00:24:26,598 --> 00:24:30,034
Get back, I'll help the children.

193
00:24:30,235 --> 00:24:33,204
The children will ride separately.
We can't all fit in one boat.

194
00:24:33,405 --> 00:24:37,967
That won't do.
I need the children with me.

195
00:24:38,543 --> 00:24:41,205
- Please!
- Shut up!

196
00:24:41,413 --> 00:24:42,607
Mother!

197
00:24:42,814 --> 00:24:46,375
Priestess, are you sure
they are reliable?

198
00:24:46,585 --> 00:24:50,385
<i>You'll be taken to the right place!</i>

199
00:24:50,589 --> 00:24:54,719
- Mother!
- Mother!

200
00:24:55,594 --> 00:24:59,792
- Mother!
- Mother!

201
00:25:00,198 --> 00:25:04,567
I'll give you all the money.
Please go back.

202
00:25:04,769 --> 00:25:08,705
Please, go back. Please!

203
00:25:08,907 --> 00:25:11,034
Mother!

204
00:25:11,943 --> 00:25:14,070
Mother!

205
00:25:14,279 --> 00:25:16,611
Go back, please!

206
00:25:20,752 --> 00:25:22,913
Please, I beg you! Please!

207
00:25:23,321 --> 00:25:26,722
- Mother!
- Mother!

208
00:25:26,925 --> 00:25:29,792
Please! Go back! Please!

209
00:25:32,397 --> 00:25:34,160
Ubatake!

210
00:25:35,100 --> 00:25:36,897
Ubatake!

211
00:25:48,179 --> 00:25:50,147
Those kids over there.

212
00:25:58,790 --> 00:26:01,190
These kids? They're too young!

213
00:26:01,393 --> 00:26:05,921
- They're smart and will be useful.
- How much?

214
00:26:06,131 --> 00:26:08,964
Four and a half silver for one.
Eight silver for both.

215
00:26:09,167 --> 00:26:11,465
They look weak.

216
00:26:17,108 --> 00:26:19,599
I don't want any sick ones. No, thanks.

217
00:26:19,811 --> 00:26:22,712
Hey! Wait a minute! Hey!

218
00:26:23,915 --> 00:26:26,406
Stop all that sobbing!

219
00:26:26,618 --> 00:26:31,214
Your mother's already been sold to
Sado. Crying won't get you anywhere!

220
00:26:31,423 --> 00:26:36,326
That's enough! If you want
to keep crying, you'll get no food.

221
00:26:43,335 --> 00:26:48,830
Please, buy them.
I need to get rid of them.

222
00:26:49,040 --> 00:26:52,498
Go to Tango. Try Sansho the Bailiff.

223
00:26:52,777 --> 00:26:55,507
- Sansho the Bailiff?
- He's the richest man there.

224
00:26:55,714 --> 00:26:58,512
- He'll buy them from you.
- I see.

225
00:26:58,717 --> 00:27:01,880
You'll have a better chance than here.

226
00:27:12,464 --> 00:27:14,261
Hurry up!

227
00:27:25,710 --> 00:27:29,771
Hey! Don't stand around!

228
00:27:41,760 --> 00:27:44,024
The kids are here.

229
00:27:55,106 --> 00:27:57,267
Bow to the master.

230
00:27:57,475 --> 00:28:01,741
You paid seven silvers
for these weaklings?

231
00:28:01,946 --> 00:28:04,141
What can they do here?

232
00:28:04,349 --> 00:28:10,083
They're too weak to do rough work.
Maybe they can sweep the yard.

233
00:28:10,288 --> 00:28:16,284
No, I spent enough on them.
They need to work as hard as others.

234
00:28:17,696 --> 00:28:19,527
What are your names?

235
00:28:19,864 --> 00:28:23,732
- They won't say, master.
- Why not?

236
00:28:23,935 --> 00:28:28,963
Stubborn kids, eh? Take them away.

237
00:28:34,546 --> 00:28:36,707
Have no mercy on them!

238
00:28:45,290 --> 00:28:48,191
Walk! Walk!

239
00:28:48,393 --> 00:28:50,020
Kinpei!

240
00:28:51,863 --> 00:28:53,330
Kinpei.

241
00:28:53,531 --> 00:28:55,294
- Brother!
- Anju!

242
00:28:55,500 --> 00:28:57,092
You come this way!

243
00:28:57,302 --> 00:28:59,600
Brother!

244
00:29:03,108 --> 00:29:04,302
Anju!

245
00:29:04,509 --> 00:29:08,775
Where do you think you're going?
That way. Get going.

246
00:29:10,482 --> 00:29:12,643
Here. A newcomer.
Teach her some work.

247
00:29:12,851 --> 00:29:15,513
- She should be playing with dolls!
- What?

248
00:29:15,720 --> 00:29:19,212
- Are you serious?
- Shut up and get to work!

249
00:29:19,424 --> 00:29:22,359
This is unbelievable. Namiji.

250
00:29:28,533 --> 00:29:31,229
- Here, try holding this.
- Yes.

251
00:29:33,571 --> 00:29:35,903
- Can you walk?
- Yes.

252
00:29:36,808 --> 00:29:39,572
Damn that heartless demon!

253
00:29:47,452 --> 00:29:53,721
I don't know who sold you,
but you poor thing!

254
00:30:42,640 --> 00:30:45,234
Get up. Come on.

255
00:30:58,790 --> 00:31:00,621
Brother!

256
00:31:19,711 --> 00:31:20,643
This way!

257
00:31:22,614 --> 00:31:23,478
Wait!

258
00:31:23,715 --> 00:31:24,647
Get back here!

259
00:31:29,520 --> 00:31:35,982
Forgive me! Please! I beg you!

260
00:31:37,028 --> 00:31:42,159
I wasn't trying to escape!
I really wasn't!

261
00:31:42,767 --> 00:31:46,635
Those kids reminded me
of mine back home.

262
00:31:46,838 --> 00:31:48,396
I just went to the third gate.

263
00:31:48,773 --> 00:31:52,504
Fool!
That's as bad as trying to escape!

264
00:31:52,710 --> 00:31:55,679
Forgive me! Please, forgive me!

265
00:31:59,951 --> 00:32:04,854
- What are you going to do?
- Give her what's due, of course.

266
00:32:08,393 --> 00:32:10,361
That's Namiji.

267
00:32:10,995 --> 00:32:12,690
Are they going to kill her?

268
00:32:12,897 --> 00:32:17,027
Of course not. If they kill us,
they have one less worker.

269
00:32:17,235 --> 00:32:18,429
Then she will be confined?

270
00:32:18,636 --> 00:32:24,370
You don't know what happens?
Look! This is what happens!

271
00:32:25,109 --> 00:32:26,440
Forgive me!

272
00:32:27,478 --> 00:32:29,275
I won't do it again!

273
00:32:29,480 --> 00:32:33,177
Please forgive me!
I won't do it again!

274
00:32:33,484 --> 00:32:37,545
She's apologizing.
You don't have to punish her!

275
00:32:37,755 --> 00:32:42,590
They need to be taught a lesson.
Here, you do it, Taro.

276
00:32:44,495 --> 00:32:46,759
You spineless coward!

277
00:33:02,647 --> 00:33:04,581
Don't look.

278
00:33:06,384 --> 00:33:11,754
Eat your supper
and start your night work!

279
00:33:11,889 --> 00:33:13,049
Hurry up and eat!

280
00:33:23,401 --> 00:33:24,766
Get in here.

281
00:33:29,707 --> 00:33:32,232
Where did you two come from?

282
00:33:37,048 --> 00:33:41,280
Come here. Tell me.

283
00:33:42,453 --> 00:33:44,353
There's no need to be afraid.

284
00:33:52,563 --> 00:33:54,497
Do you have parents?

285
00:33:55,099 --> 00:33:56,430
They sold you?

286
00:33:56,634 --> 00:33:59,432
Father would never sell us!

287
00:33:59,804 --> 00:34:04,639
"Father," you say?
You're no peasant's kids.

288
00:34:04,842 --> 00:34:08,642
Why were you sold?
Tell me everything.

289
00:34:19,791 --> 00:34:22,123
Here, have some rice cake.

290
00:34:23,995 --> 00:34:25,860
It's roasted well.

291
00:34:40,878 --> 00:34:46,214
A messenger from the minister is
coming, and Taro decides to disappear!

292
00:34:46,417 --> 00:34:49,181
Hey, Kichiji!

293
00:34:49,921 --> 00:34:53,084
Where's Taro? Go find him!

294
00:34:53,291 --> 00:34:59,491
A guest will be here soon.
Get the women ready!

295
00:35:08,906 --> 00:35:10,601
And bring some <i>sake!</i>

296
00:35:11,642 --> 00:35:16,272
Even children as young as you
are sold and bought...

297
00:35:16,481 --> 00:35:19,780
...treated like animals,
and nobody questions it.

298
00:35:20,751 --> 00:35:22,912
What a horrible world!

299
00:35:28,793 --> 00:35:32,194
Tell me your father's words again.

300
00:35:33,164 --> 00:35:37,100
"A man is not a human being
without mercy.

301
00:35:37,301 --> 00:35:41,670
Even if you are hard on yourself,
be merciful to others."

302
00:35:55,052 --> 00:35:59,512
I want to get you back
to your parents, but Sado is far.

303
00:36:00,057 --> 00:36:02,958
Tsukushi is even farther than that.

304
00:36:03,161 --> 00:36:06,130
It is not a distance
that children can travel on their own.

305
00:36:07,765 --> 00:36:12,634
Wait until you grow up!
Whatever happens, you must endure it.

306
00:36:16,541 --> 00:36:21,274
I now see why
you keep your names secret...

307
00:36:21,846 --> 00:36:26,943
...but you will need something.
I will give you names.

308
00:36:27,752 --> 00:36:33,054
For you, Mutsu-Waka,
after your birthplace.

309
00:36:34,225 --> 00:36:40,095
You will be Shinobu,
"to endure through anything."

310
00:36:41,632 --> 00:36:43,031
- Understood?
- Yes.

311
00:36:48,439 --> 00:36:50,202
Taro-sama!

312
00:36:53,544 --> 00:36:54,602
There you are.

313
00:36:54,812 --> 00:36:57,007
A messenger from the minister
is about to arrive.

314
00:36:57,215 --> 00:36:58,705
You are needed back in the hall.

315
00:36:58,916 --> 00:37:04,115
- Tell my father you couldn't find me.
- He is an important guest from Kyoto!

316
00:37:07,925 --> 00:37:09,790
Come. Let's go.

317
00:37:14,665 --> 00:37:19,762
Such a sudden visit.
I thought you had come to scold us.

318
00:37:19,971 --> 00:37:26,103
Nonsense. What for?
We only have to thank you.

319
00:37:27,411 --> 00:37:31,245
You collect taxes promptly...

320
00:37:31,449 --> 00:37:34,509
...and provide more tributes
every year. It is a great help to us.

321
00:37:35,486 --> 00:37:38,011
I am honored, sir.

322
00:37:38,789 --> 00:37:44,193
You're the most trusted man
among all the bailiffs.

323
00:37:44,528 --> 00:37:49,329
The minister insisted that I visit
and study the methods you use...

324
00:37:49,533 --> 00:37:51,626
...in the handling of your people.

325
00:37:52,136 --> 00:37:56,163
Please, I do not deserve such praise.

326
00:37:56,374 --> 00:38:02,472
I am only doing my duty
in managing his lordship's manor.

327
00:38:02,680 --> 00:38:05,547
It is seldom done these days.

328
00:38:05,750 --> 00:38:08,583
The minister appreciates
your work so much...

329
00:38:08,786 --> 00:38:13,485
...he is thinking of inviting you
to Kyoto as a reward.

330
00:38:14,692 --> 00:38:16,922
- Is that true, sir?
- Yes.

331
00:38:17,895 --> 00:38:23,959
I cannot believe it.
I appreciate his kindness.

332
00:38:25,736 --> 00:38:28,933
Kichiji, bring the chest!

333
00:38:37,281 --> 00:38:41,445
This is a humble token
of my gratitude, sir.

334
00:38:41,786 --> 00:38:44,186
This is impressive. Thank you.

335
00:38:44,555 --> 00:38:47,820
This is my son, Taro.
Show your gratitude.

336
00:38:48,025 --> 00:38:53,429
You are lucky to have such a father.
Be a dutiful son.

337
00:38:55,066 --> 00:38:57,830
Girls, begin your dance!

338
00:40:20,317 --> 00:40:21,944
Are you asleep?

339
00:40:51,816 --> 00:40:53,807
Take care of yourselves.

340
00:41:04,495 --> 00:41:05,928
Open the gate.

341
00:41:06,130 --> 00:41:09,031
- Where to so late?
- It's none of your business.

342
00:41:40,197 --> 00:41:43,963
AFTER TEN YEARS,
THE YOUNG CHILDREN...

343
00:41:44,301 --> 00:41:47,930
...HAVE DEVELOPED INTO
STURDY YOUNG ADULTS...

344
00:41:48,272 --> 00:41:51,935
...IN SPITE OF THEIR LONG
HARDSHIP AND MISERY.

345
00:41:52,276 --> 00:41:55,973
THE WINTER FINDS ZUSHIO...

346
00:41:56,313 --> 00:42:00,272
...ALIAS MUTSU, 23 YEARS OLD.
ANJU, KNOWN AS SHINOBU, IS 18.

347
00:42:25,543 --> 00:42:27,773
Brother, wake up.

348
00:42:27,978 --> 00:42:30,674
- What?
- The alarm.

349
00:42:58,976 --> 00:43:03,242
That way! He ran that way!

350
00:43:08,619 --> 00:43:11,486
This way! This way!

351
00:43:12,423 --> 00:43:14,755
Come back here, you!

352
00:43:16,961 --> 00:43:18,952
- Over there!
- Get him!

353
00:43:20,030 --> 00:43:21,827
Why, you!

354
00:43:22,066 --> 00:43:24,091
Catch him!

355
00:43:25,302 --> 00:43:27,600
Get him! Get him!

356
00:43:35,746 --> 00:43:38,374
Let me go! Please!

357
00:43:38,582 --> 00:43:44,714
I've been working patiently
for 50 years!

358
00:43:44,922 --> 00:43:46,412
Let me go.

359
00:43:46,624 --> 00:43:51,425
I'm already 70.
My days are numbered!

360
00:43:51,629 --> 00:43:56,191
Let me die a free man!
I don't want to die here!

361
00:43:56,400 --> 00:43:59,460
Mutsu, you handle this.

362
00:44:20,891 --> 00:44:24,520
- Who did the branding?
- It was Mutsu-Waka.

363
00:44:24,728 --> 00:44:27,128
How cruel of him!

364
00:44:27,331 --> 00:44:29,094
He'll die a miserable death.

365
00:44:29,299 --> 00:44:34,532
Mutsu is a bad one.
Must be the son of a bandit.

366
00:44:48,986 --> 00:44:53,047
Don't worry,
you're not to blame for anything.

367
00:44:54,491 --> 00:44:58,518
- Teach this newcomer.
- Pleased to meet you.

368
00:45:05,803 --> 00:45:07,464
Take care of her.

369
00:45:31,795 --> 00:45:33,660
Look. Like this.

370
00:45:35,332 --> 00:45:36,993
Try it.

371
00:45:45,476 --> 00:45:48,343
- What's your name?
- Kohagi.

372
00:45:48,545 --> 00:45:51,139
- How old are you?
- Sixteen.

373
00:45:51,348 --> 00:45:54,249
- Are you a peasant's daughter?
- Yes.

374
00:45:54,785 --> 00:45:57,276
- Where were you sold from?
- Sado.

375
00:45:58,222 --> 00:45:59,587
Sado?

376
00:46:00,924 --> 00:46:05,020
Do you happen to know
a woman named Tamaki?

377
00:46:05,229 --> 00:46:06,526
No.

378
00:46:06,730 --> 00:46:11,167
She was sold 10 years ago.
She was 35 or 36 then.

379
00:46:11,368 --> 00:46:13,962
She must be 45 or 46 by now.

380
00:46:14,171 --> 00:46:18,699
I'm sorry. Sado is a big island.

381
00:46:31,755 --> 00:46:34,246
Are you in pain again, Namiji-san?

382
00:46:34,458 --> 00:46:38,224
I feel as though a heavy stone
is in my stomach.

383
00:46:38,428 --> 00:46:40,919
You're getting worse.

384
00:46:41,131 --> 00:46:44,328
I can't rest unless I die.

385
00:46:44,568 --> 00:46:47,765
We're not human beings.

386
00:46:50,674 --> 00:46:55,441
Why does the rest of the world
turn its back on us?

387
00:46:55,946 --> 00:47:00,315
What are you saying?
You're talking like a newcomer.

388
00:47:03,687 --> 00:47:08,124
I have to get back to work. You too.

389
00:47:14,698 --> 00:47:24,471
<i>Zushio, how I long for you!</i>
<i>Isn't life torture?</i>

390
00:47:30,547 --> 00:47:39,251
<i>Anju, how I long for you!</i>
<i>Isn't life torture?</i>

391
00:47:40,157 --> 00:47:51,796
<i>So miserable as I am sold away</i>

392
00:47:56,540 --> 00:48:02,308
<i>Boatman, quietly row away</i>

393
00:48:02,512 --> 00:48:05,538
Hey, what song are you singing?

394
00:48:07,451 --> 00:48:10,079
What is it called?

395
00:48:10,287 --> 00:48:13,779
It goes, "Zushio, how I long for you.
Anju, how I long for you."

396
00:48:13,991 --> 00:48:15,959
Who taught you that?

397
00:48:16,159 --> 00:48:18,184
It became a popular song in Sado.

398
00:48:18,395 --> 00:48:21,455
Who first sang such a sad song?

399
00:48:21,665 --> 00:48:23,064
A courtesan, they say.

400
00:48:23,267 --> 00:48:26,794
- A courtesan?
- Yes, named Nakagimi.

401
00:48:27,404 --> 00:48:31,670
Do you think she's still alive?

402
00:48:31,875 --> 00:48:34,844
I don't know.

403
00:48:35,045 --> 00:48:38,310
"Zushio, how I long for you.
Isn't life torture?

404
00:48:38,515 --> 00:48:42,281
Anju, how I long for you.
Isn't life torture?" Is that right?

405
00:48:42,719 --> 00:48:45,688
- Sing it again.
- Yes.

406
00:48:47,958 --> 00:48:57,128
<i>Zushio, how I long for you!</i>

407
00:49:03,407 --> 00:49:11,940
<i>Isn't life torture?</i>

408
00:49:13,283 --> 00:49:22,453
<i>Anju, how I long for you!</i>

409
00:49:28,699 --> 00:49:32,692
<i>Isn't life torture?</i>

410
00:49:32,903 --> 00:49:34,598
It's Mother!

411
00:49:38,542 --> 00:49:47,177
<i>Isn't life torture?</i>

412
00:49:56,994 --> 00:50:04,958
<i>Isn't life torture?</i>

413
00:50:33,397 --> 00:50:36,730
Wait! Please, wait!

414
00:50:38,035 --> 00:50:43,439
Take me too! Please, take me!

415
00:50:43,640 --> 00:50:46,370
This is all the money I have!

416
00:50:46,576 --> 00:50:51,036
Row off, quickly! Please!

417
00:50:55,252 --> 00:50:59,848
Nakagimi! Not again.
We're going back!

418
00:51:06,496 --> 00:51:08,589
She's impossible!

419
00:51:09,032 --> 00:51:11,193
Cut her tendon so she can't run away!

420
00:51:13,470 --> 00:51:17,702
Please, I won't do it again!
Please have mercy on me!

421
00:51:17,908 --> 00:51:19,341
Shut up!

422
00:51:32,456 --> 00:51:34,253
Please forgive me!

423
00:51:43,867 --> 00:51:48,327
Remember, girls.
Runaways are punished like this!

424
00:52:29,513 --> 00:52:34,678
Too bad, Nakagimi-san.
We can't see the mainland today.

425
00:53:03,914 --> 00:53:07,213
Zushio.

426
00:53:12,622 --> 00:53:16,251
Anju.

427
00:53:50,560 --> 00:53:58,695
<i>Zushio, how I long for you!</i>

428
00:53:58,868 --> 00:54:06,172
<i>Isn't life torture?</i>

429
00:54:06,743 --> 00:54:11,407
Anju, stop it! Stop singing.

430
00:54:11,615 --> 00:54:17,281
It's the first news about Mother
we've heard.

431
00:54:18,054 --> 00:54:20,022
Don't you care?

432
00:54:20,223 --> 00:54:24,125
Don't you think of Father
and Mother anymore?

433
00:54:24,728 --> 00:54:27,060
Don't you want to see them again?

434
00:54:27,264 --> 00:54:30,392
What's the use of wanting?

435
00:54:32,502 --> 00:54:35,528
If we escape, we'll find a way.

436
00:54:35,739 --> 00:54:42,110
How? We don't have any money.
How will we look for them?

437
00:54:42,312 --> 00:54:45,110
Just look at us. It's better
not to meet them like this.

438
00:54:45,315 --> 00:54:48,978
So we'll go to Kyoto
and become somebodies.

439
00:54:49,185 --> 00:54:52,154
Become somebodies?
Stop dreaming.

440
00:54:52,355 --> 00:54:56,792
Despite our births,
we're servants now. Slaves!

441
00:54:56,993 --> 00:54:58,790
Who'd bother with us?

442
00:55:00,764 --> 00:55:03,824
You'll be sold to a brothel.
I'll become a thief.

443
00:55:04,034 --> 00:55:07,993
Or we'll both be beggars.

444
00:55:08,204 --> 00:55:11,298
You already have the heart of a bandit!

445
00:55:11,508 --> 00:55:14,306
A soul lower than that of a beggar!

446
00:55:15,578 --> 00:55:21,175
How can you brand
an old man's forehead like that?

447
00:55:21,384 --> 00:55:24,148
How can you be so brutal?

448
00:55:25,021 --> 00:55:27,353
Did you forget Father's words?

449
00:55:27,557 --> 00:55:30,856
Don't you feel shame
before the goddess of mercy?

450
00:55:33,029 --> 00:55:34,656
Brother!

451
00:55:37,801 --> 00:55:39,826
How could you?

452
00:55:40,036 --> 00:55:43,472
It does me no good!

453
00:55:43,673 --> 00:55:49,270
It's better to be loyal to the bailiff
and get on his good side.

454
00:55:49,479 --> 00:55:53,279
You have changed.

455
00:56:19,943 --> 00:56:25,904
Mutsu, Namiji isn't going to make it.
Go dump her in the mountains.

456
00:56:40,163 --> 00:56:44,497
Namiji is like our sister.

457
00:56:44,701 --> 00:56:49,297
Please let her die here.

458
00:56:54,611 --> 00:56:57,341
- Take her, Mutsu.
- Yes.

459
00:56:58,415 --> 00:57:01,111
Don't take her, brother.

460
00:57:01,451 --> 00:57:05,751
She's still alive.
Don't give her to wild birds.

461
00:57:05,955 --> 00:57:07,923
It's the bailiff's orders.

462
00:57:44,360 --> 00:57:46,294
Another dead one?

463
00:57:47,597 --> 00:57:50,088
This one's still alive.

464
00:57:50,767 --> 00:57:53,133
- Take them.
- Yes, sir.

465
00:57:54,737 --> 00:57:57,706
Open the gate.

466
00:58:13,890 --> 00:58:15,721
Not you!

467
00:58:26,302 --> 00:58:32,764
When you're reincarnated,
be born to a good family!

468
00:58:34,911 --> 00:58:38,472
Be born to a rich family!

469
00:59:07,210 --> 00:59:09,804
Hey, hurry up.

470
00:59:19,122 --> 00:59:25,186
I tied this to the Buddha,
so hold it tight.

471
00:59:31,367 --> 00:59:34,666
And this is the goddess of mercy,
Kwannon.

472
00:59:34,871 --> 00:59:39,467
You'll be born fortunate
in your next life.

473
00:59:57,727 --> 00:59:58,921
Ready?

474
00:59:59,128 --> 01:00:05,465
That's too ruthless. Please let me
protect her from the frost.

475
01:00:05,668 --> 01:00:08,364
Make it quick.

476
01:00:08,571 --> 01:00:10,038
Brother, help me.

477
01:01:30,453 --> 01:01:36,790
Brother, doesn't this remind you of
the time we camped near Naoe Port?

478
01:01:39,195 --> 01:01:45,498
Mother had us gather straw and grass
like this, remember?

479
01:01:46,669 --> 01:01:50,628
<i>Zushio!</i>

480
01:01:50,840 --> 01:01:56,142
<i>Anju!</i>

481
01:01:57,213 --> 01:01:59,545
Oh, Mother is calling us!

482
01:02:04,854 --> 01:02:09,814
<i>Zushio!</i>

483
01:03:16,726 --> 01:03:20,127
Anju, let's run away.

484
01:03:20,329 --> 01:03:21,819
What?

485
01:03:22,165 --> 01:03:23,598
Let's escape!

486
01:03:30,306 --> 01:03:32,399
You mean it?

487
01:03:46,289 --> 01:03:47,586
Then hurry!

488
01:03:47,790 --> 01:03:50,020
- Go alone.
- What about you?

489
01:03:50,226 --> 01:03:52,660
We'll be caught if we're together.

490
01:03:52,862 --> 01:03:57,663
I'll delay them. Meanwhile,
run away as fast as you can.

491
01:04:00,603 --> 01:04:04,334
They say there is a temple
at Nakayama. You'll be safe there.

492
01:04:04,540 --> 01:04:08,306
I can't leave you. They'll torture you.

493
01:04:11,347 --> 01:04:14,043
They don't kill slaves very often.

494
01:04:14,250 --> 01:04:15,877
Don't worry.

495
01:04:16,686 --> 01:04:19,416
They'll catch us
if we run away together.

496
01:04:19,622 --> 01:04:22,147
If you go alone, you'll be all right.

497
01:04:23,826 --> 01:04:26,659
Don't worry about me.

498
01:04:29,398 --> 01:04:33,596
If you can, take Namiji-san with you.

499
01:04:37,840 --> 01:04:41,640
Go while I talk with the gatekeeper.

500
01:04:42,678 --> 01:04:45,977
The amulet is on Namiji's chest.

501
01:04:49,752 --> 01:04:51,310
Wait for me.

502
01:04:51,721 --> 01:04:55,555
I'll come back for you,
even if it's the last thing I do!

503
01:05:11,173 --> 01:05:13,801
My brother will do the rest.

504
01:05:14,677 --> 01:05:15,837
What?

505
01:05:16,045 --> 01:05:20,311
Thank you for waiting. My brother
will handle the rest. Let's go.

506
01:05:20,516 --> 01:05:25,977
I hope I don't end up like that.
Let's go, quickly.

507
01:05:48,978 --> 01:05:51,469
Come, Namiji-san, let's go.

508
01:06:21,978 --> 01:06:24,970
Your brother is taking a long time.

509
01:06:25,181 --> 01:06:27,240
He'll come soon.

510
01:06:55,478 --> 01:06:57,070
What happened?

511
01:06:58,914 --> 01:07:00,779
He's late.

512
01:07:02,485 --> 01:07:03,884
Hey.

513
01:07:04,820 --> 01:07:06,720
You go look.

514
01:07:38,521 --> 01:07:41,957
He's gone! He's gone!

515
01:07:42,458 --> 01:07:45,052
- He ran away!
- What?

516
01:07:46,796 --> 01:07:49,765
You slut! You must be behind this.

517
01:07:50,866 --> 01:07:54,734
Kayano, watch her! Get more men!

518
01:08:16,125 --> 01:08:18,559
Master! Bailiff!

519
01:08:18,761 --> 01:08:22,253
- What happened?
- What is it?

520
01:08:22,465 --> 01:08:25,400
- Mutsu the slave escaped!
- Escaped?

521
01:08:25,768 --> 01:08:28,828
- And Shinobu?
- She's at the gate.

522
01:08:29,038 --> 01:08:31,734
Torture her. She must know
where he's headed.

523
01:08:31,941 --> 01:08:36,708
Hurry and search the village!
Hurry up!

524
01:08:38,681 --> 01:08:43,243
You know where Mutsu went,
don't you?

525
01:08:49,525 --> 01:08:54,553
I believe you're determined
not to say at any cost...

526
01:08:54,763 --> 01:08:58,699
...but you'll be talking
after they torture you.

527
01:09:02,371 --> 01:09:04,635
No torture...

528
01:09:05,875 --> 01:09:09,902
...can make a dead person speak.

529
01:09:24,293 --> 01:09:29,128
It's too late for you to outrun them.

530
01:09:39,975 --> 01:09:43,741
Tie me up here and go
before it's too late.

531
01:09:43,946 --> 01:09:46,608
Thank you, Kayano-san.

532
01:09:55,824 --> 01:09:57,416
Now go.

533
01:10:04,033 --> 01:10:07,161
Hurry. Hurry.

534
01:10:07,937 --> 01:10:11,600
Farewell. Farewell.

535
01:10:12,875 --> 01:10:16,504
- Farewell.
- Farewell.

536
01:10:29,758 --> 01:10:32,625
Search throughout the gorge.

537
01:10:32,828 --> 01:10:34,853
Come on, run!

538
01:10:38,767 --> 01:10:40,564
Which way?

539
01:11:09,932 --> 01:11:16,394
<i>Zushio, how I long for you!</i>

540
01:11:24,246 --> 01:11:31,880
<i>Isn't life torture?</i>

541
01:11:34,089 --> 01:11:41,291
<i>Anju, how I long for you!</i>

542
01:11:50,406 --> 01:11:59,110
<i>Isn't life torture?</i>

543
01:12:58,540 --> 01:13:00,201
Move away!

544
01:13:03,345 --> 01:13:05,813
Check the back!

545
01:13:10,319 --> 01:13:13,982
Where is he? Don't lose him!

546
01:13:17,326 --> 01:13:18,793
Over here!

547
01:13:19,027 --> 01:13:20,995
Over there!

548
01:13:21,363 --> 01:13:24,127
That way!

549
01:13:28,871 --> 01:13:30,771
Damn it.

550
01:13:31,373 --> 01:13:33,068
Look! This way!

551
01:13:33,275 --> 01:13:34,469
What?

552
01:13:36,078 --> 01:13:39,013
Have you found him?

553
01:13:47,689 --> 01:13:49,748
Where did he go?

554
01:13:57,800 --> 01:14:00,564
We have been sent by the bailiff
in search of a runaway!

555
01:14:00,769 --> 01:14:03,795
He must be hiding here!
Hand him over!

556
01:14:04,006 --> 01:14:06,975
If you refuse, you will be punished
by the minister.

557
01:14:07,176 --> 01:14:12,443
You come bearing arms
as if a riot has broken out.

558
01:14:14,383 --> 01:14:17,750
Seeking one of your servants, eh?

559
01:14:19,154 --> 01:14:23,386
No one gets shelter here
without my permission.

560
01:14:23,759 --> 01:14:27,422
As I haven't given any,
he can't be here.

561
01:14:32,234 --> 01:14:36,603
And may I remind you
this is an imperial temple.

562
01:14:39,908 --> 01:14:41,500
Look.

563
01:14:42,511 --> 01:14:44,945
THE IMPERIAL TEMPLE
THE PROVINCE OF TANGO

564
01:14:46,114 --> 01:14:48,981
It is the imperial signature.

565
01:14:49,785 --> 01:14:52,948
Trespassers will be severely punished!

566
01:14:54,022 --> 01:14:56,889
Leave quietly. For your own good.

567
01:14:57,092 --> 01:14:59,117
I saw him!

568
01:14:59,328 --> 01:15:01,819
He went in that direction!

569
01:15:02,364 --> 01:15:07,063
Southward, along the wall!
Hurry! You'll probably catch him.

570
01:15:07,269 --> 01:15:10,761
Let's go!

571
01:15:15,077 --> 01:15:17,068
Go left!

572
01:15:20,315 --> 01:15:23,113
Go in the back alley!

573
01:16:12,968 --> 01:16:14,560
How is she doing?

574
01:16:15,037 --> 01:16:18,768
Thanks to your medicine,
she's gotten better.

575
01:16:18,974 --> 01:16:25,072
- Good. I'm glad to hear that.
- Thank you very much.

576
01:16:25,280 --> 01:16:27,714
I'm so glad.

577
01:16:41,763 --> 01:16:44,527
What are your plans?

578
01:16:45,500 --> 01:16:50,528
Taro-sama, I have a favor
to ask of you.

579
01:16:53,508 --> 01:16:57,672
Can you keep Namiji-san here?

580
01:16:57,879 --> 01:17:03,909
I would be happy to,
but what about you?

581
01:17:04,119 --> 01:17:06,417
I plan to go to Kyoto.

582
01:17:06,955 --> 01:17:10,015
Who is the most powerful man there?

583
01:17:12,127 --> 01:17:13,788
Well...

584
01:17:14,363 --> 01:17:19,357
...the chief advisor to the emperor,
I should say. But why?

585
01:17:19,568 --> 01:17:21,399
Taro-sama...

586
01:17:21,837 --> 01:17:26,934
...why did you leave
your father's house?

587
01:17:28,810 --> 01:17:31,677
Do you intend to appeal
to the chief advisor?

588
01:17:32,247 --> 01:17:33,544
Yes, sir.

589
01:17:39,321 --> 01:17:45,282
I had the same idea
and went to Kyoto too.

590
01:17:46,762 --> 01:17:50,926
But it wasn't as easy as I thought.

591
01:17:51,400 --> 01:17:54,597
My single-handed efforts proved futile.

592
01:17:57,606 --> 01:18:02,737
I found that humans
have little sympathy...

593
01:18:02,944 --> 01:18:07,813
...for things that don't
directly concern them.

594
01:18:08,550 --> 01:18:10,450
They're ruthless.

595
01:18:13,021 --> 01:18:16,787
Unless those hearts can be changed...

596
01:18:16,992 --> 01:18:20,393
...the world you dream of
cannot come true.

597
01:18:22,931 --> 01:18:29,336
If you wish to live honestly
with your conscience...

598
01:18:30,439 --> 01:18:34,466
...keep close to the Buddha.

599
01:18:36,578 --> 01:18:38,341
With all due respect...

600
01:18:39,114 --> 01:18:44,882
...this is something that I must do,
no matter what the cost.

601
01:18:47,723 --> 01:18:49,190
I see.

602
01:18:50,025 --> 01:18:56,328
Then do as you wish.
You have a difficult road ahead of you.

603
01:18:57,499 --> 01:19:00,093
I am prepared for that.

604
01:19:00,736 --> 01:19:02,067
Very well.

605
01:19:02,270 --> 01:19:08,072
I'll ask the head priest to write
a letter to the chief advisor.

606
01:19:08,276 --> 01:19:12,212
Thank you very much.
Thank you so very much.

607
01:22:11,793 --> 01:22:14,762
Please, my lord, if I may have a word!

608
01:22:14,963 --> 01:22:18,455
Please! Please, my lord!

609
01:22:19,000 --> 01:22:24,336
I am the son of the former deputy
governor of Mutsu! Please, my lord!

610
01:22:24,539 --> 01:22:26,473
- Get back!
- Please!

611
01:22:26,675 --> 01:22:30,509
I have here a letter from Priest Donmo
of the temple in Nakayama!

612
01:22:30,712 --> 01:22:34,910
I'm doing this
as I was refused at the gate!

613
01:22:35,116 --> 01:22:39,109
- Please! I beg you!
- Call the guards!

614
01:22:39,321 --> 01:22:41,380
- Please!
- Stay away!

615
01:22:41,589 --> 01:22:43,454
Please! Please!

616
01:22:43,658 --> 01:22:47,059
I beg you!

617
01:23:01,910 --> 01:23:05,937
Please, listen to me!
Please! Please!

618
01:23:07,048 --> 01:23:11,712
Please! I beg of you! Please!

619
01:23:30,805 --> 01:23:32,204
Where did you steal this from?

620
01:23:32,407 --> 01:23:36,366
I didn't steal it!
It is my family's treasure!

621
01:23:38,380 --> 01:23:41,349
Return it to me!

622
01:23:41,549 --> 01:23:43,710
That's my father's keepsake!

623
01:23:46,087 --> 01:23:48,555
Please give it back to me!

624
01:23:48,757 --> 01:23:53,990
Please, for God's sake,
give it back to me!

625
01:24:24,626 --> 01:24:25,957
Come out!

626
01:24:30,432 --> 01:24:34,300
Don't send me back to Sansho
the Bailiff! Please! Please!

627
01:24:34,502 --> 01:24:38,029
Don't worry.
His lordship has sent for you.

628
01:24:38,239 --> 01:24:40,002
You're a lucky fellow.

629
01:24:40,208 --> 01:24:43,541
Come out.
You must not keep him waiting.

630
01:25:16,177 --> 01:25:19,442
- I have brought him.
- Come this way.

631
01:25:40,034 --> 01:25:41,592
He is here, my lord.

632
01:25:43,671 --> 01:25:45,070
Good.

633
01:25:52,614 --> 01:25:54,081
Raise your head.

634
01:25:54,282 --> 01:25:56,011
The letter you bring...

635
01:25:56,217 --> 01:26:01,416
...claims you are the son
of Masauji Taira of Mutsu, is that true?

636
01:26:01,623 --> 01:26:03,648
Yes, your lordship.

637
01:26:03,858 --> 01:26:05,917
The statue you had
in your possession...

638
01:26:06,127 --> 01:26:09,324
...originally belonged to
one of my forefathers, Michinaga.

639
01:26:09,531 --> 01:26:15,026
He gave it to your family in recognition
of their good works. Did you know that?

640
01:26:15,236 --> 01:26:19,639
I was only told that it was a treasure
handed down in our family.

641
01:26:20,508 --> 01:26:24,103
My father left it with me
when he was sent to Tsukushi.

642
01:26:24,846 --> 01:26:27,872
Your Lordship!
Was what my father did a crime?

643
01:26:28,082 --> 01:26:31,051
Is it unlawful to love your people?

644
01:26:31,386 --> 01:26:37,347
No, but one must obey
his superior officer.

645
01:26:38,626 --> 01:26:44,565
However, your father argued
with arrogant military men.

646
01:26:44,766 --> 01:26:47,200
He was a man of extraordinary courage.

647
01:26:47,402 --> 01:26:49,927
You knew about that, my lord?

648
01:26:50,138 --> 01:26:54,404
Had I been in office,
things would have been different.

649
01:26:54,609 --> 01:26:57,908
Then will you pardon him now?

650
01:26:58,680 --> 01:27:02,172
It would make little difference now.

651
01:27:03,818 --> 01:27:08,619
Zushio, do not let this dishearten you.

652
01:27:10,124 --> 01:27:15,824
Your father has already departed
this transient life.

653
01:27:18,233 --> 01:27:21,100
When did it happen, my lord?

654
01:27:21,302 --> 01:27:24,533
After reading your letter,
I took the liberty to investigate.

655
01:27:24,739 --> 01:27:29,403
He passed away
during the spring of last year.

656
01:27:37,819 --> 01:27:43,849
I sympathize with you
and the hardships you have endured.

657
01:27:55,236 --> 01:27:58,728
In recognition of his achievement
and efforts...

658
01:27:58,940 --> 01:28:02,876
...I am arranging for you
to succeed your father's title.

659
01:28:03,778 --> 01:28:08,772
For me? For me, my lord?

660
01:28:08,983 --> 01:28:12,316
The post of governor
of Tango is vacant.

661
01:28:12,520 --> 01:28:15,080
I will give you that post.

662
01:28:15,290 --> 01:28:17,622
- Governor?
- Right.

663
01:28:20,995 --> 01:28:25,796
Masamichi Taira is created a peer
of the Junior Grade of the Fifth Rank.

664
01:28:43,718 --> 01:28:49,486
"Masamichi Taira, of the Fifth Rank, is
hereby appointed governor of Tango."

665
01:28:55,096 --> 01:28:59,430
This is the imperial prescript
of your post. Come closer.

666
01:29:05,873 --> 01:29:09,673
I have chosen a name
befitting a governor.

667
01:29:09,877 --> 01:29:13,574
From now on, call yourself
Masamichi ("Righteous Path") Taira.

668
01:29:13,848 --> 01:29:15,941
Visit your father's tomb.

669
01:29:16,751 --> 01:29:18,378
Thank you, my lord.

670
01:29:19,620 --> 01:29:24,648
My father may be dead, but
my mother and sister will be delighted.

671
01:29:24,859 --> 01:29:27,623
Now I can make a happy life for them.

672
01:29:27,829 --> 01:29:33,131
I can also liberate the slaves...

673
01:29:33,334 --> 01:29:35,825
...from the infernal house of Sansho.

674
01:29:36,037 --> 01:29:39,837
What? Liberate slaves?

675
01:29:40,041 --> 01:29:41,736
Nonsense.

676
01:29:41,943 --> 01:29:46,710
Yura Manor is the property
of the Minister of the Right.

677
01:29:46,914 --> 01:29:52,875
A governor isn't authorized
to interfere with a private manor.

678
01:29:53,955 --> 01:29:57,982
How do you expect to carry out
your duties without knowing that?

679
01:29:58,326 --> 01:30:01,318
Carefully reconsider your limitations.

680
01:30:03,264 --> 01:30:05,232
Understand?

681
01:30:11,105 --> 01:30:16,543
Imagine, the governor of Tango
coming all the way to Tsukushi.

682
01:30:16,744 --> 01:30:22,080
His lordship is the son
of Lord Masauji who died here.

683
01:30:22,283 --> 01:30:25,480
He came before going to his post.

684
01:30:25,686 --> 01:30:29,019
A truly dutiful son.

685
01:30:43,971 --> 01:30:50,240
My regret is that I could not come
while he was still alive.

686
01:31:12,567 --> 01:31:14,967
I see so many flowers.

687
01:31:23,211 --> 01:31:27,705
Have you been keeping them
on his grave like this?

688
01:31:27,915 --> 01:31:33,785
No, sir. They are from those
who remember his kindness.

689
01:31:33,988 --> 01:31:38,288
Your father was kind
to everyone he met...

690
01:31:38,493 --> 01:31:41,826
...especially the unfortunate peasants.

691
01:31:42,029 --> 01:31:45,988
Your father taught them
how to read and write...

692
01:31:46,200 --> 01:31:49,169
...and how to live a moral life.

693
01:32:20,768 --> 01:32:23,202
I am Judge Norimura, my lord.

694
01:32:23,404 --> 01:32:26,669
We congratulate you
on your new post...

695
01:32:26,908 --> 01:32:30,469
...and humbly welcome you
and wish you a smooth transition.

696
01:32:31,012 --> 01:32:33,003
Thank you for welcoming me.

697
01:32:59,440 --> 01:33:02,466
I'm Murotsuna, my lord.

698
01:33:03,077 --> 01:33:05,511
Narisada, my lord.

699
01:33:05,780 --> 01:33:08,476
Toneyasu, my lord.

700
01:33:08,983 --> 01:33:14,546
I want to do something in lieu
of announcing my arrival.

701
01:33:14,855 --> 01:33:17,722
All but Norimura and his staff may go.

702
01:33:26,968 --> 01:33:30,495
I want to issue a decree. Take note.

703
01:33:32,873 --> 01:33:37,367
In this province,
the sale of human beings...

704
01:33:37,578 --> 01:33:41,275
...is forbidden by penalty of the law.

705
01:33:43,384 --> 01:33:47,912
<i>The use of slaves shall be prohibited...</i>

706
01:33:48,122 --> 01:33:50,852
<i>... on both government lands</i>
<i>and private manors.</i>

707
01:33:52,793 --> 01:33:55,523
Is this an order from the capital?

708
01:33:55,730 --> 01:33:58,255
No, it is my own.

709
01:33:58,466 --> 01:34:03,096
Yours? Are you sure you want
to issue such a decree?

710
01:34:03,304 --> 01:34:05,169
Do you think I am joking?

711
01:34:05,373 --> 01:34:08,968
I am sure you have your reasons...

712
01:34:09,243 --> 01:34:14,078
...but you must admit this is reckless
even for your young age.

713
01:34:14,281 --> 01:34:16,772
Reckless? What is reckless about it?

714
01:34:16,984 --> 01:34:19,509
- I have more.
- One moment.

715
01:34:19,720 --> 01:34:24,214
A governor only has jurisdiction
over government land.

716
01:34:24,425 --> 01:34:27,053
Manors are private property, sir.

717
01:34:27,261 --> 01:34:30,389
Interfering with them
will bring serious consequences...

718
01:34:30,598 --> 01:34:35,058
...especially when the manor belongs
to the Minister of the Right.

719
01:34:35,269 --> 01:34:39,103
Its bailiff, Sansho,
is a difficult adversary.

720
01:34:39,306 --> 01:34:43,174
I want to liberate Sansho's slaves.

721
01:34:43,377 --> 01:34:44,844
What are you saying, my lord?

722
01:34:45,046 --> 01:34:50,678
He is an official
personally appointed by the minister.

723
01:34:50,885 --> 01:34:55,618
His slaves are the property
of the minister himself.

724
01:34:55,823 --> 01:34:59,691
As their guardian,
the bailiff will fight you!

725
01:34:59,894 --> 01:35:02,260
- I don't want to hear any more.
- That's not all, sir.

726
01:35:02,463 --> 01:35:04,090
Should this reach the capital...

727
01:35:04,298 --> 01:35:09,065
...the minister will undoubtedly move
to have you discharged.

728
01:35:09,270 --> 01:35:11,534
You may be exiled!

729
01:35:11,739 --> 01:35:16,802
Your very life might be in danger!

730
01:35:17,011 --> 01:35:23,211
I do not understand where you got
such an extraordinary idea...

731
01:35:23,417 --> 01:35:26,386
...but please give it up
for your own good.

732
01:35:26,587 --> 01:35:30,614
- Norimura, you wish to disobey me?
- No, my lord!

733
01:35:31,025 --> 01:35:32,890
Continue.

734
01:35:33,894 --> 01:35:40,163
The liberated slaves shall be granted
the choice of being sent home...

735
01:35:40,367 --> 01:35:43,131
...or staying on the land
as employees...

736
01:35:43,337 --> 01:35:47,398
...to be paid fairly in money or land.

737
01:35:47,608 --> 01:35:48,870
That is all.

738
01:35:49,076 --> 01:35:52,705
Publish this throughout the province.
Understood?

739
01:35:54,949 --> 01:35:56,416
Norimura.

740
01:36:00,888 --> 01:36:06,690
I want you to go to Sansho's
and fetch a girl named Shinobu.

741
01:36:06,894 --> 01:36:09,488
A girl named Shinobu, sir?

742
01:36:09,697 --> 01:36:12,257
- That's right.
- Yes, sir.

743
01:36:33,020 --> 01:36:36,717
- There is no such girl here.
- No? Are you sure?

744
01:36:36,924 --> 01:36:41,258
Even if she were, a local official
cannot make demands to see her.

745
01:36:41,462 --> 01:36:46,456
Remember, this is the manor
of the Minister of the Right.

746
01:36:46,667 --> 01:36:49,192
No governor can butt in here.

747
01:36:49,403 --> 01:36:52,930
Go while the going's still good!

748
01:36:55,776 --> 01:36:59,337
Off with you! Go away!

749
01:37:00,381 --> 01:37:01,575
Go!

750
01:37:19,433 --> 01:37:21,594
- Did you turn him away?
- Of course.

751
01:37:21,802 --> 01:37:27,468
The fool. Why would he want
Shinobu anyway?

752
01:37:28,075 --> 01:37:30,805
But don't let your guard down.
Stand on alert.

753
01:37:35,316 --> 01:37:37,409
What nonsense.

754
01:37:44,625 --> 01:37:46,684
I don't understand it at all.

755
01:37:58,839 --> 01:38:00,807
"The buying and selling
of human beings...

756
01:38:01,008 --> 01:38:07,140
...and use of slaves are prohibited
in this province of Tango.

757
01:38:07,348 --> 01:38:10,943
<i>Violators will be severely punished.</i>

758
01:38:11,151 --> 01:38:15,383
<i>Issued November 25 in the seventh</i>
<i>year of Kanji by the governor of Tango."</i>

759
01:38:15,589 --> 01:38:18,888
Who is this new governor?

760
01:38:19,093 --> 01:38:25,123
He must be absolutely crazy!
We're going to make him pay!

761
01:38:29,870 --> 01:38:34,034
Dispatch a courier to Kyoto.
Let the minister know of this at once.

762
01:38:34,241 --> 01:38:35,674
Yes, sir.

763
01:38:38,913 --> 01:38:42,644
Be sure the slaves don't hear this.

764
01:38:42,850 --> 01:38:48,015
Those morons are liable
to start meaningless trouble.

765
01:38:49,423 --> 01:38:55,453
And tear down all of the notices
as fast as you can!

766
01:39:06,040 --> 01:39:07,974
Go away!

767
01:39:11,045 --> 01:39:15,311
No buying and selling of slaves?
Knock it down.

768
01:39:28,295 --> 01:39:32,197
- What does it say?
- I can't read!

769
01:39:37,104 --> 01:39:39,197
Destroy it!

770
01:39:57,758 --> 01:40:03,822
- The governor's notice!
- We're free!

771
01:40:20,080 --> 01:40:21,604
Hold it there!

772
01:40:44,004 --> 01:40:47,269
Let's go!

773
01:40:54,281 --> 01:40:55,578
Ready my men!

774
01:40:55,783 --> 01:40:59,150
Please, sir! As noble as your idea is...

775
01:40:59,353 --> 01:41:01,753
You couldn't possibly understand!

776
01:41:01,955 --> 01:41:05,948
Think of those
who rot in that earthly hell!

777
01:41:06,160 --> 01:41:08,287
- Are we ready?
- Yes, sir.

778
01:41:35,823 --> 01:41:37,518
They have arrived, master.

779
01:41:38,625 --> 01:41:42,823
It is a privilege to welcome you.

780
01:41:43,030 --> 01:41:48,468
I'm afraid there is nothing to offer you,
as this is so sudden.

781
01:41:51,305 --> 01:41:53,739
It has been a while, bailiff.

782
01:41:59,113 --> 01:42:00,705
Mutsu-Waka!

783
01:42:01,949 --> 01:42:03,917
I am Masamichi, governor of Tango.

784
01:42:08,422 --> 01:42:13,883
You have changed.
I apologize for not recognizing you.

785
01:42:14,094 --> 01:42:17,461
Do make yourself at home, please.

786
01:42:17,664 --> 01:42:19,894
- Bring some drinks.
- Don't bother.

787
01:42:20,100 --> 01:42:21,727
I do not come as a friend.

788
01:42:22,436 --> 01:42:26,532
You and your men are under arrest.

789
01:42:29,643 --> 01:42:33,875
- What for? What have I done wrong?
- Silence!

790
01:42:34,081 --> 01:42:37,414
Destroying the governor's signpost
is crime enough.

791
01:42:38,685 --> 01:42:44,988
Oh, do you mean
those lawless notices? I see.

792
01:42:45,192 --> 01:42:50,528
Now I know how they got there.
However, this manor belongs to...

793
01:42:50,731 --> 01:42:54,292
- I already know!
- Then all the more reason...

794
01:42:54,635 --> 01:42:59,231
...your recklessness is sure
to rebound on you.

795
01:42:59,439 --> 01:43:01,930
I recommend you promptly
repeal your decree.

796
01:43:02,142 --> 01:43:06,545
If you do, I will not report this
to the minister.

797
01:43:09,216 --> 01:43:13,050
I don't know how you rose
to this position of yours...

798
01:43:13,253 --> 01:43:18,316
...but a slave becoming a governor,
that's a true fairy tale!

799
01:43:18,592 --> 01:43:22,858
- You should not spoil it.
- Is that all you have to say?

800
01:43:23,096 --> 01:43:26,463
You need not inquire about me.

801
01:43:26,667 --> 01:43:30,228
Your property shall be confiscated
and you will be exiled. Arrest him!

802
01:43:30,437 --> 01:43:32,871
Release me!

803
01:43:33,073 --> 01:43:35,405
Who do you think you're dealing with?

804
01:43:35,609 --> 01:43:37,907
Whose house do you think this is?

805
01:43:39,413 --> 01:43:45,648
Prepare yourself for the punishment
that will fall for attacking this manor!

806
01:43:45,852 --> 01:43:47,683
Let me go!

807
01:43:51,892 --> 01:43:53,860
Release me!

808
01:43:54,661 --> 01:43:56,686
I'm telling you to release me!

809
01:44:00,767 --> 01:44:04,066
Listen carefully, friends.

810
01:44:04,638 --> 01:44:10,508
In the province of Tango,
slave trade has been banned.

811
01:44:11,445 --> 01:44:14,380
In both government land
and private manors...

812
01:44:14,581 --> 01:44:17,812
...the use of slaves
has been prohibited.

813
01:44:20,020 --> 01:44:26,220
From this moment on, you are no longer
the property of Sansho the Bailiff.

814
01:44:27,227 --> 01:44:30,663
You are all now free!

815
01:44:33,967 --> 01:44:36,458
You may go home if you wish.

816
01:44:37,471 --> 01:44:40,634
You may stay here and work.

817
01:44:40,841 --> 01:44:43,503
You will be paid...

818
01:44:44,311 --> 01:44:48,213
...or given land as your own.

819
01:44:55,355 --> 01:44:56,754
<i>Nio.</i>

820
01:45:04,998 --> 01:45:06,795
Oh, Mutsu-Waka!

821
01:45:07,868 --> 01:45:14,364
My sins in branding you
can never be erased...

822
01:45:14,675 --> 01:45:20,443
...but I ask you to let this
make up for part of it.

823
01:45:27,321 --> 01:45:28,652
Anju.

824
01:45:29,723 --> 01:45:31,520
Did you hear me?

825
01:45:31,925 --> 01:45:35,292
Shinobu, I mean. Did you hear me?

826
01:45:36,697 --> 01:45:38,062
Hey.

827
01:45:39,032 --> 01:45:41,296
Where is my sister?

828
01:45:43,637 --> 01:45:45,127
Where is she?

829
01:45:45,839 --> 01:45:47,431
What happened?

830
01:45:48,241 --> 01:45:50,106
Tell me.

831
01:45:51,445 --> 01:45:54,972
She passed away.

832
01:45:55,182 --> 01:45:56,843
He killed her?

833
01:45:57,818 --> 01:45:59,786
No.

834
01:46:16,069 --> 01:46:19,470
Why didn't you wait for me?

835
01:46:21,274 --> 01:46:24,607
I truly believed you would.

836
01:46:26,713 --> 01:46:29,409
It was your great faith...

837
01:46:30,283 --> 01:46:33,844
...that gave me back my life.

838
01:46:36,957 --> 01:46:39,551
Why didn't you wait
for your brother's return?

839
01:47:58,605 --> 01:48:01,506
Sansho's house is on fire, sir.

840
01:48:01,708 --> 01:48:03,107
What?

841
01:48:25,999 --> 01:48:32,131
He and his family
have already been exiled, sir.

842
01:48:41,815 --> 01:48:44,283
To the Chief Advisor

843
01:48:50,790 --> 01:48:55,352
Submit this letter to the chief advisor.
It is my resignation.

844
01:48:55,562 --> 01:48:56,961
What?

845
01:49:00,000 --> 01:49:04,164
Perhaps you think it very strange...

846
01:49:04,538 --> 01:49:09,908
...but those who shared in my
suffering will appreciate my actions.

847
01:49:22,589 --> 01:49:25,615
I am going to Sado tomorrow.
Please make the preparations.

848
01:49:25,825 --> 01:49:27,258
Yes, sir.

849
01:49:45,412 --> 01:49:48,643
All aboard.

850
01:49:49,849 --> 01:49:53,250
The boat is leaving.

851
01:49:57,524 --> 01:49:59,890
Come on, hurry.

852
01:50:09,502 --> 01:50:12,630
You are not coming aboard?
What's the matter?

853
01:50:12,839 --> 01:50:19,074
I'm looking for a woman named
Nakagimi. Can you help me?

854
01:50:19,279 --> 01:50:21,747
Nakagimi? She must be a courtesan.

855
01:50:21,948 --> 01:50:27,853
There are brothels over there.
They can tell you.

856
01:51:02,822 --> 01:51:06,918
I want to see Nakagimi.
Is she one of you?

857
01:51:08,461 --> 01:51:11,191
- Yeah, she is.
- Where?

858
01:51:11,398 --> 01:51:13,161
That house.

859
01:51:15,201 --> 01:51:17,965
She's getting ready.

860
01:51:41,261 --> 01:51:43,058
Nakagimi-san?

861
01:51:51,504 --> 01:51:54,132
- Nakagimi-san?
- Who is it?

862
01:51:59,412 --> 01:52:03,508
Welcome. Come here.

863
01:52:04,184 --> 01:52:07,585
Are you really Nakagimi-san?

864
01:52:07,787 --> 01:52:12,520
Of course.
I'm the one and only Nakagimi.

865
01:52:12,759 --> 01:52:15,421
Come here.

866
01:52:15,628 --> 01:52:18,096
Well?

867
01:52:21,101 --> 01:52:22,762
What's the matter?

868
01:52:23,503 --> 01:52:26,165
Come have a good time.

869
01:52:27,240 --> 01:52:30,869
Why are you leaving?

870
01:52:33,179 --> 01:52:36,012
You cheapskate!

871
01:52:37,317 --> 01:52:40,377
Are you penniless?

872
01:52:40,887 --> 01:52:42,787
You idiot!

873
01:52:43,690 --> 01:52:45,681
You were rejected!

874
01:52:54,100 --> 01:52:55,795
What's wrong?

875
01:52:56,269 --> 01:53:00,899
It wasn't her. I'm looking for
a woman over 40.

876
01:53:01,107 --> 01:53:04,770
Oh, you must mean
the former Nakagimi-san.

877
01:53:04,978 --> 01:53:09,278
- Do you know her?
- She's dead now, I think.

878
01:53:10,150 --> 01:53:14,018
She was found dead by the cape.

879
01:53:14,220 --> 01:53:16,950
Or was it that
she jumped into the sea?

880
01:53:17,157 --> 01:53:18,920
You're all wrong.

881
01:53:19,125 --> 01:53:23,960
She was killed by
the big tsunami two years ago.

882
01:53:24,297 --> 01:53:28,791
Are you a relative or something?

883
01:53:29,602 --> 01:53:31,331
Where did it happen?

884
01:53:33,006 --> 01:53:35,531
Beyond that cape over there.

885
01:54:45,378 --> 01:54:51,613
Excuse me. I heard that this area
was hit by a tsunami two years ago.

886
01:54:51,818 --> 01:54:53,376
That's right.

887
01:54:53,586 --> 01:55:00,355
The village lost nine or 10
to the vicious waves.

888
01:55:00,960 --> 01:55:04,794
Many bodies haven't
been discovered yet.

889
01:55:07,500 --> 01:55:12,802
Why do you want to hear
about that tsunami?

890
01:55:22,115 --> 01:55:30,147
<i>Isn't life torture?</i>

891
01:55:38,598 --> 01:55:48,200
<i>Zushio, how I long for you!</i>

892
01:56:18,404 --> 01:56:26,903
<i>Anju, how I long for you!</i>

893
01:56:48,835 --> 01:56:55,297
<i>Isn't life torture?</i>

894
01:57:00,413 --> 01:57:09,151
<i>Isn't life torture?</i>

895
01:57:15,395 --> 01:57:25,236
<i>Anju, how I long for you!</i>

896
01:57:32,145 --> 01:57:33,806
Mother!

897
01:57:39,118 --> 01:57:41,086
It's me, Zushio.

898
01:57:42,955 --> 01:57:45,287
You wretched being.

899
01:57:45,491 --> 01:57:50,656
You've come to try and fool me again.

900
01:58:03,076 --> 01:58:05,340
Go away.

901
01:58:05,711 --> 01:58:07,076
Mother.

902
01:58:09,082 --> 01:58:15,021
You can't fool me anymore.

903
01:58:57,296 --> 01:58:59,059
Mother.

904
01:59:04,537 --> 01:59:05,936
Here.

905
01:59:47,180 --> 01:59:51,640
It is the Kwannon
that Father gave me.

906
02:00:08,901 --> 02:00:10,528
Zushio?

907
02:00:25,017 --> 02:00:27,645
Are you truly?

908
02:00:27,987 --> 02:00:30,319
Do you recognize me?

909
02:00:31,490 --> 02:00:34,391
I came for you, Mother.

910
02:00:39,699 --> 02:00:41,496
Zushio.

911
02:00:43,903 --> 02:00:46,303
Zushio.

912
02:00:57,650 --> 02:01:01,313
Are you alone?

913
02:01:05,291 --> 02:01:07,623
Anju is with you, right?

914
02:01:08,394 --> 02:01:13,161
Anju, where is she?

915
02:01:13,966 --> 02:01:17,163
Please bring her. Right away.

916
02:01:17,370 --> 02:01:19,600
Anju has...

917
02:01:19,805 --> 02:01:22,501
Anju has gone to join Father.

918
02:01:25,611 --> 02:01:27,476
Your father?

919
02:01:28,247 --> 02:01:30,579
Is he doing well?

920
02:01:34,053 --> 02:01:37,545
No, Mother. It's just you and I.

921
02:01:37,757 --> 02:01:41,056
We're all alone now.

922
02:02:04,684 --> 02:02:09,883
I could have come for you...

923
02:02:10,089 --> 02:02:12,785
...as a governor...

924
02:02:14,360 --> 02:02:20,822
...but I gave up my title
in order to follow Father's teachings.

925
02:02:22,301 --> 02:02:25,327
Please, Mother, forgive me!

926
02:02:38,784 --> 02:02:42,345
What nonsense do you speak of?

927
02:02:42,555 --> 02:02:48,323
I don't know what you have done...

928
02:02:51,464 --> 02:02:55,696
...but I know that you followed
your father's teachings.

929
02:02:57,937 --> 02:03:00,405
And that is why...

930
02:03:02,575 --> 02:03:09,003
...we have been able to meet again.

931
02:04:11,444 --> 02:04:18,407
THE END
