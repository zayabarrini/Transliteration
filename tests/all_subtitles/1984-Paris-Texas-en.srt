1
00:04:57,474 --> 00:05:00,602
What the hell?

2
00:05:06,550 --> 00:05:08,450
Hey.

3
00:05:13,524 --> 00:05:16,982
<i>You know which side of the border you're on?</i>

4
00:05:17,094 --> 00:05:19,528
<i>You got a name, boy?</i>

5
00:05:20,764 --> 00:05:23,460
Guess...

6
00:05:23,567 --> 00:05:26,434
somethin' must have
cut your tongue off.

7
00:05:28,672 --> 00:05:30,640
Either that, or...

8
00:05:32,743 --> 00:05:37,612
you've got somethin'... to hide.

9
00:05:37,715 --> 00:05:41,378
Ah.

10
00:05:41,485 --> 00:05:43,385
Never can tell.

11
00:05:46,190 --> 00:05:50,126
You hear me plain enough.

12
00:05:54,531 --> 00:05:56,431
Ah.

13
00:05:58,736 --> 00:06:00,727
"Walter R. Henderson."

14
00:06:03,407 --> 00:06:05,534
<i>Now, I want to ask you</i>
<i>one last question.</i>

15
00:06:07,845 --> 00:06:10,837
You see this here card?

16
00:06:10,948 --> 00:06:12,916
Is it you?

17
00:06:14,218 --> 00:06:16,914
Or a relative of yours?

18
00:06:19,156 --> 00:06:22,489
Well, I'm gonna call up this number...

19
00:06:22,593 --> 00:06:26,085
and see if they can tell me who you are.

20
00:06:26,196 --> 00:06:30,155
I ain't got beds enough
to be puttin' up mutes.

21
00:06:37,875 --> 00:06:41,538
<i>Operator, I need a line out, please.</i>

22
00:06:43,881 --> 00:06:46,816
<i>Los Angeles, California.</i>

23
00:06:46,917 --> 00:06:48,885
<i>Area code--</i>

24
00:06:56,927 --> 00:06:59,418
Uh, what?

25
00:06:59,530 --> 00:07:03,694
Well, can you -- Can you tell me the exact
location of your hospital down there?

26
00:07:05,402 --> 00:07:07,734
Uh, where the hell's that?

27
00:07:09,573 --> 00:07:12,508
Oh, okay. All right.
Yeah, um --

28
00:07:12,609 --> 00:07:15,442
Okay, I'll be there.
I'll get there as fast as I can.

29
00:07:15,546 --> 00:07:19,073
Just --Will you tell him
that I'm coming, okay? Okay.

30
00:07:24,855 --> 00:07:27,551
Steven, I think you will have to change that.

31
00:07:27,658 --> 00:07:28,625
This section right here?

32
00:07:28,725 --> 00:07:30,454
Yeah, because it's in the copy.

33
00:07:30,561 --> 00:07:33,086
<i>Anne, honey?</i>

34
00:07:33,197 --> 00:07:37,065
<i>- I just got the strangest phone call.</i>
- Who from?

35
00:07:37,167 --> 00:07:41,103
From some hospital in South Texas --
a place called Terlingua.

36
00:07:42,706 --> 00:07:44,606
They say they found Travis.

37
00:07:44,708 --> 00:07:46,539
Oh, no.

38
00:07:46,643 --> 00:07:49,043
What are you going to do?

39
00:07:49,146 --> 00:07:52,377
- Well, I'll go down and-and get him.
- Oh, Walt.

40
00:07:52,483 --> 00:07:54,951
What am I gonna do?
I can't leave him down there.

41
00:07:58,722 --> 00:08:00,519
What about Hunter?

42
00:08:00,624 --> 00:08:02,649
What am I supposed to tell him?

43
00:08:02,759 --> 00:08:06,251
Uh, well, just tell him
I had to go on a business trip.

44
00:08:06,363 --> 00:08:08,388
I mean about Travis.

45
00:08:14,271 --> 00:08:16,501
Well.

46
00:08:16,607 --> 00:08:18,905
I guess you better
tell him the truth.

47
00:08:40,163 --> 00:08:42,028
10 to Van Horn.

48
00:08:42,132 --> 00:08:44,566
90... to Alpine.

49
00:08:44,668 --> 00:08:46,568
118 south.

50
00:08:48,639 --> 00:08:50,539
Terlingua.

51
00:09:21,171 --> 00:09:23,366
You must be the brother of the mute.

52
00:09:24,908 --> 00:09:26,808
- Mute?
<i>- Ja.</i>

53
00:09:27,978 --> 00:09:31,379
They couldn't squeeze
the time of day out of him.

54
00:09:33,050 --> 00:09:35,712
Must be in a kind of jam, huh?

55
00:09:37,187 --> 00:09:39,655
I don't know.
I haven't seen him in over four years.

56
00:09:40,691 --> 00:09:42,784
Is that right?

57
00:09:42,893 --> 00:09:47,262
Well, a lot can happen to a man
in four years, I guess.

58
00:09:48,298 --> 00:09:52,291
All kinds of trouble -- expensive trouble.

59
00:09:52,402 --> 00:09:54,165
What do you mean?

60
00:09:54,271 --> 00:09:56,296
<i>Well, down here...</i>

61
00:09:56,406 --> 00:09:59,375
a man gets himself
into a fix sometimes.

62
00:09:59,476 --> 00:10:02,377
<i>And it costs a little to get him out.</i>

63
00:10:02,479 --> 00:10:04,447
You understand what I mean.

64
00:10:05,515 --> 00:10:07,949
I don't understand you.

65
00:10:08,051 --> 00:10:10,884
I wish you'd get to the point,
'cause I'd like to see my brother.

66
00:10:13,023 --> 00:10:14,923
All right, sir.

67
00:10:15,025 --> 00:10:18,324
<i>But first I would like</i>
<i>to ask you something.</i>

68
00:10:18,428 --> 00:10:22,660
Did your brother ever get hisself
into a car wreck?

69
00:10:26,470 --> 00:10:30,270
Uh, car wreck.
No, uh, not that I know of.

70
00:10:30,374 --> 00:10:34,538
<i>Then he must be mixing</i>
<i>with some hard company.</i>

71
00:10:34,645 --> 00:10:39,048
I'd like to see my brother now,
if you don't mind.

72
00:10:40,450 --> 00:10:44,045
- He disappeared.
- You mean he's not here?

73
00:10:44,154 --> 00:10:46,054
After I came all this way?

74
00:10:46,156 --> 00:10:49,455
He's been gone since early this morning.

75
00:10:50,927 --> 00:10:54,226
<i>We have his possessions nevertheless.</i>

76
00:10:54,331 --> 00:10:57,767
Saved them.

77
00:10:57,868 --> 00:11:00,200
We'd be glad to turn 'em over to you...

78
00:11:00,303 --> 00:11:04,967
<i>as soon as you take care</i>
<i>of our little reward.</i>

79
00:12:38,168 --> 00:12:39,635
Travis?

80
00:12:42,672 --> 00:12:44,640
Travis. Hey.

81
00:12:48,411 --> 00:12:50,879
Don't you recognize me?
It's Walt.

82
00:12:58,655 --> 00:13:00,555
It's your brother--Walt.

83
00:13:18,575 --> 00:13:22,944
What the hell happened to you anyway?
You look like 40 miles of rough road.

84
00:13:33,824 --> 00:13:35,917
Come on. Let's get in the car. Trav?

85
00:13:37,627 --> 00:13:39,527
Come on.

86
00:13:42,032 --> 00:13:43,932
Yeah.

87
00:13:49,005 --> 00:13:50,905
Come on.

88
00:14:31,681 --> 00:14:33,945
Here, Trav. Here's your stuff.

89
00:14:35,986 --> 00:14:37,954
I got that back at that clinic back there.

90
00:14:39,890 --> 00:14:43,883
Sure picked a hell of a spot to land in.
I don't blame you for running out of it.

91
00:14:48,965 --> 00:14:52,128
Um, look, Trav...

92
00:14:52,235 --> 00:14:54,669
we got quite a bit of travelin' to do here.

93
00:14:54,771 --> 00:14:57,069
You're not gonna clam up
the whole way, are you?

94
00:14:58,341 --> 00:15:00,036
I mean, it'll get kind of lonely.

95
00:15:04,581 --> 00:15:06,549
Trav?

96
00:15:08,118 --> 00:15:12,020
Would you mind telling me where you
disappeared to for the last four years?

97
00:15:17,260 --> 00:15:19,626
Uh, have you seen Jane or talked to her?

98
00:15:22,766 --> 00:15:25,963
<i>Gee, Anne and I, we sort of gave up on you.</i>

99
00:15:26,069 --> 00:15:29,869
We actually--
We thought you were dead, boy.

100
00:16:06,209 --> 00:16:08,109
It's pretty, uh --

101
00:16:19,055 --> 00:16:21,023
Okay.

102
00:16:29,299 --> 00:16:31,290
Well --

103
00:16:31,401 --> 00:16:33,596
Yeah.

104
00:16:35,739 --> 00:16:38,537
Well, gee, Trav,
maybe you wanna get cleaned up...

105
00:16:38,641 --> 00:16:40,802
you know, take a shower or something?

106
00:16:40,910 --> 00:16:44,107
Um, I think I'll go back into town
and get you some new clothes.

107
00:16:44,214 --> 00:16:46,205
You could use a new set of clothes,
couldn't you?

108
00:16:48,385 --> 00:16:50,285
Wh-What size shoes you wear?

109
00:16:51,988 --> 00:16:54,149
Right. We'll see.

110
00:16:58,028 --> 00:16:59,928
I'm probably one size bigger, huh?

111
00:17:02,365 --> 00:17:05,198
So, where'd you find that beard?

112
00:17:05,301 --> 00:17:08,429
It's pretty snazzy.

113
00:17:10,707 --> 00:17:13,938
Okay. I'll zip into town
and zip right back.

114
00:17:15,445 --> 00:17:17,345
I won't be gone long.

115
00:17:24,654 --> 00:17:27,088
You'll be okay, won't you, Trav?

116
00:17:29,626 --> 00:17:32,186
Yeah, I'll -- I'll be right back.

117
00:19:23,806 --> 00:19:25,774
Damn it.

118
00:20:23,633 --> 00:20:26,693
You mind telling me
where you're headed, Trav?

119
00:20:30,273 --> 00:20:32,537
What's out there?

120
00:20:38,581 --> 00:20:40,549
There's nothin' out there.

121
00:20:43,152 --> 00:20:45,120
Don't you trust me or somethin'? Huh?

122
00:20:48,758 --> 00:20:51,750
I'm just trying to help you, Trav.
That's all.

123
00:20:57,000 --> 00:20:59,161
Now come on. It's all right.

124
00:20:59,269 --> 00:21:02,466
Come on with me in the car. Huh?

125
00:22:08,204 --> 00:22:11,105
Kind of feels good
to be in new clothes, huh?

126
00:22:34,097 --> 00:22:36,964
- Hello.
- Hi. Hunter? It's Daddy.

127
00:22:38,000 --> 00:22:41,731
- I thought you'd be in bed already.
- I'm watching TV.

128
00:22:41,838 --> 00:22:45,069
Guess who I'm visiting here in Texas.

129
00:22:46,175 --> 00:22:49,235
- Who?
- Your father.

130
00:22:49,345 --> 00:22:51,313
Do you remember your father?

131
00:22:52,648 --> 00:22:54,980
<i>- No.</i>
<i>- Not at all?</i>

132
00:22:55,084 --> 00:22:57,917
<i>I remember he was kind of skinny.</i>

133
00:22:58,020 --> 00:23:01,114
<i>- He was?</i>
<i>- I think he was.</i>

134
00:23:01,224 --> 00:23:03,988
<i>- Well, guess what.</i>
<i>-I don't know.</i>

135
00:23:04,093 --> 00:23:06,186
<i>I'm gonna bring him home to visit.</i>

136
00:23:21,043 --> 00:23:22,943
Travis.

137
00:23:25,348 --> 00:23:28,977
Do you remember your little boy? Hunter.

138
00:23:31,988 --> 00:23:34,354
<i>Well, he's with us.</i>

139
00:23:34,457 --> 00:23:37,722
<i>He's been living with Anne and me</i>
<i>ever since you disappeared.</i>

140
00:23:39,495 --> 00:23:43,226
We didn't know what else to do,
so we just kept him.

141
00:23:45,334 --> 00:23:47,734
<i>One day, he was just standing at the door.</i>

142
00:23:48,771 --> 00:23:52,832
All he could tell us was that
someone brought him there in a car.

143
00:23:54,143 --> 00:23:56,907
<i>He didn't know</i>
<i>what had happened to you or Jane.</i>

144
00:23:58,147 --> 00:24:01,878
<i>We tried everything we could think of</i>
<i>to find you or Jane.</i>

145
00:24:01,984 --> 00:24:04,111
<i>We tried to locate her.</i>
<i>She'd vanished too.</i>

146
00:24:05,521 --> 00:24:07,682
We didn't know what else to do.

147
00:24:13,095 --> 00:24:15,154
<i>Travis...</i>

148
00:24:15,264 --> 00:24:17,391
<i>I don't know</i>
<i>what kind of trouble you got into.</i>

149
00:24:18,835 --> 00:24:20,860
<i>I don't know what happened.</i>

150
00:24:22,338 --> 00:24:24,966
But, damn it, I'm your brother, man.

151
00:24:26,642 --> 00:24:28,667
You can talk to me.

152
00:24:32,014 --> 00:24:34,107
<i>I’m tired of doing all the talking.</i>

153
00:25:17,593 --> 00:25:19,493
Fill it with unleaded, please.

154
00:25:22,031 --> 00:25:24,431
You know, I'm gettin' a little sick
of this silence routine.

155
00:25:24,534 --> 00:25:27,594
You can talk.

156
00:25:36,646 --> 00:25:38,773
I can be silent too, you know.

157
00:25:41,918 --> 00:25:44,478
I'd just as soon that both of us keep our mouths
shut for the whole rest of the trip.

158
00:25:44,587 --> 00:25:47,681
<i>- Paris.</i>
- You know --What?

159
00:25:49,625 --> 00:25:51,593
Paris.

160
00:25:56,265 --> 00:25:58,165
Paris?

161
00:25:58,267 --> 00:25:59,928
Paris?

162
00:26:01,737 --> 00:26:04,262
Did you ever go to Paris?

163
00:26:05,408 --> 00:26:09,174
- No.
- Could we go there now?

164
00:26:11,614 --> 00:26:13,514
It's a little out of the way.

165
00:26:16,919 --> 00:26:19,683
<i>Uh, no, I've never even been to Europe.</i>

166
00:26:19,789 --> 00:26:21,916
<i>Anne keeps wanting to go there.</i>

167
00:26:22,024 --> 00:26:24,117
<i>'Cause, well, she's from France,</i>
<i>you remember?</i>

168
00:26:25,361 --> 00:26:29,354
<i>But we never seem to find the time</i>
<i>'cause my company keeps me kind of busy.</i>

169
00:26:44,647 --> 00:26:46,615
Let's go, Trav.

170
00:26:49,585 --> 00:26:52,452
- What's the matter?
- Where we going?

171
00:26:52,555 --> 00:26:54,580
We're gonna fly to I.A.

172
00:26:54,690 --> 00:26:56,920
You're not afraid of flying, are you?

173
00:26:57,026 --> 00:26:59,119
We're... leaving the ground?

174
00:26:59,228 --> 00:27:02,356
- Yeah.
- Why?

175
00:27:02,465 --> 00:27:04,865
Because it's too far to drive.

176
00:27:04,967 --> 00:27:07,231
It would take an extra two days.
I can't afford the time, Trav.

177
00:27:07,336 --> 00:27:09,497
- Why?
- Be --

178
00:27:09,605 --> 00:27:11,630
Look, it's just easier to fly, Trav.

179
00:27:11,741 --> 00:27:14,676
It's faster. Come on.

180
00:27:33,362 --> 00:27:35,330
<i>Let's get you home, okay?</i>

181
00:27:35,431 --> 00:27:38,195
<i>I’m gonna get you home, get you settled,</i>
<i>and then you can do whatever you want.</i>

182
00:27:38,300 --> 00:27:39,858
<i>Let me out, or I'll jump.</i>

183
00:27:39,969 --> 00:27:43,166
<i>Sir, we can't stop the plane</i>
<i>every time somebody gets terrified.</i>

184
00:27:43,272 --> 00:27:46,537
<i>You don't get on a plane</i>
<i>and then refuse to leave the ground.</i>

185
00:27:46,642 --> 00:27:49,941
<i>You don't do things like that.</i>
<i>This isn't the wilderness.</i>

186
00:27:50,046 --> 00:27:52,139
<i>You're living with people now. Okay?</i>

187
00:27:52,248 --> 00:27:53,738
<i>You should've hired a private plane.</i>

188
00:27:53,849 --> 00:27:55,942
Do you realize how many people
you're detaining?

189
00:27:56,052 --> 00:27:57,952
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

190
00:27:58,054 --> 00:27:59,988
I'm sorry. I'm sorry. Okay?

191
00:28:00,089 --> 00:28:02,922
- Okay, I'm fine now.
- Bye now.

192
00:28:03,025 --> 00:28:05,687
This is getting a little ridiculous, Travis.

193
00:28:07,163 --> 00:28:09,597
Are you gonna leave me?

194
00:28:09,699 --> 00:28:11,667
No, I'm not gonna leave you.

195
00:28:12,902 --> 00:28:15,166
It's all right if you leave me.

196
00:28:15,271 --> 00:28:17,262
I don't know, honey, no.

197
00:28:17,373 --> 00:28:19,603
He just -- He just panicked or something.

198
00:28:21,143 --> 00:28:23,373
Well, it won't do any good
to try another plane.

199
00:28:23,479 --> 00:28:26,937
<i>It wasn't the plane.</i>
<i>He'll just get off again.</i>

200
00:28:27,049 --> 00:28:29,483
Well, we're just gonna
have to drive it. That's all.

201
00:28:29,585 --> 00:28:33,419
<i>Message for Joy Stockwell. Joy Stockwell.</i>
- Yeah, it'll take a good two days.

202
00:28:33,522 --> 00:28:35,888
<i>Austin will arrive at any minute.</i>

203
00:28:35,991 --> 00:28:39,483
<i>I don't understand why you have to have</i>
<i>the very same car you had before.</i>

204
00:28:39,595 --> 00:28:41,222
They're all alike.

205
00:28:41,330 --> 00:28:45,562
All the cars we have here are 'birds,
Olds, Chevies or whatever.

206
00:28:45,668 --> 00:28:47,659
I'm not even sure I can locate
the same car you had before.

207
00:28:47,770 --> 00:28:51,206
I know, I know. Uh, my brother
left something in the car.

208
00:28:51,307 --> 00:28:53,298
We're hoping we can search the car
and find it.

209
00:28:53,409 --> 00:28:56,810
Oh, well, I'll just contact our lost and found
department for you if that's the case.

210
00:28:56,912 --> 00:28:59,608
No, no. We have to have the very same car.

211
00:28:59,715 --> 00:29:02,343
Well, I can't do that.
There's no way I can trace that car for you.

212
00:29:02,451 --> 00:29:05,978
<i>- Why not? You got the license number</i>
<i>right on your form there.</i>
<i>- Well, yes, but--</i>

213
00:29:06,088 --> 00:29:07,988
Just give us the license number.
<i>We'll</i> find it.

214
00:29:08,090 --> 00:29:11,457
But I can't allow you on the lot, sir.

215
00:29:11,560 --> 00:29:13,187
Why not? We're already on it.

216
00:29:13,295 --> 00:29:15,763
I just have to ask you
to come back to the office with me.

217
00:29:18,000 --> 00:29:20,161
Travis!

218
00:29:20,269 --> 00:29:22,066
What?

219
00:29:22,171 --> 00:29:24,662
I don't think we're gonna get
the very same car.

220
00:29:24,774 --> 00:29:28,266
<i>But I can rent you a model</i>
<i>that's just like the one you had before, sir.</i>

221
00:29:29,445 --> 00:29:32,608
We need the same car, Walt.
How are we gonna go in another car?

222
00:29:34,416 --> 00:29:36,316
Give us the number,
will you, please?

223
00:29:37,386 --> 00:29:39,354
Come on. Pretty please.

224
00:29:40,923 --> 00:29:44,359
All right. That number is 667 DJ P.

225
00:29:44,460 --> 00:29:45,290
Six - Remember that?

226
00:29:45,394 --> 00:29:47,362
- 667 DJ P.
- That's right.

227
00:29:47,463 --> 00:29:49,954
- It's -- It's got a bump on the hood.
- Yes, it does.

228
00:30:05,447 --> 00:30:08,211
- What's that?
- What?

229
00:30:08,317 --> 00:30:10,842
That --what you got in your hand.

230
00:30:10,953 --> 00:30:13,683
- A picture.
- Oh? Picture of what?

231
00:30:14,723 --> 00:30:17,021
A picture...

232
00:30:17,126 --> 00:30:20,721
of, uh, Paris.

233
00:30:20,830 --> 00:30:22,627
Paris? Really?

234
00:30:22,731 --> 00:30:25,165
Yes. Picture of a piece of Paris.

235
00:30:25,267 --> 00:30:27,633
Where'd you get a picture of Paris?

236
00:30:27,736 --> 00:30:29,704
- Can I see it?
- Yes.

237
00:30:31,207 --> 00:30:33,937
This is it? This is Paris?

238
00:30:34,043 --> 00:30:36,273
Looks just like Texas to me.

239
00:30:36,378 --> 00:30:38,175
It is.

240
00:30:38,280 --> 00:30:41,010
Paris, Texas?

241
00:30:41,116 --> 00:30:43,584
- It's right here on the map.
- There's really a place called Paris, Texas?

242
00:30:43,686 --> 00:30:45,654
It's right here.

243
00:30:47,957 --> 00:30:50,926
Well, how come you got a picture
of a vacant lot in Paris, Texas?

244
00:30:51,961 --> 00:30:53,861
It's mine.

245
00:30:53,963 --> 00:30:56,955
I know that, but how come you got it?

246
00:30:57,066 --> 00:31:01,162
Uh, I purchased it in-in the mail...

247
00:31:01,270 --> 00:31:03,295
a long time ago.

248
00:31:03,405 --> 00:31:05,669
You bought a picture of a vacant lot
in the mail?

249
00:31:05,774 --> 00:31:08,504
No. I bought the land.

250
00:31:09,578 --> 00:31:11,205
- Oh, you bought that lot.
- Yes.

251
00:31:11,313 --> 00:31:13,281
Oh. Let me see it again.

252
00:31:15,217 --> 00:31:16,616
There's nothin' on it.

253
00:31:16,719 --> 00:31:19,051
Empty.

254
00:31:20,356 --> 00:31:23,723
Why in hell would you want to buy
a vacant lot in Paris, Texas, for Chrissake?

255
00:31:26,295 --> 00:31:28,195
Um...

256
00:31:34,670 --> 00:31:36,570
I forgot.

257
00:31:38,274 --> 00:31:40,936
Here, Trav.

258
00:31:46,949 --> 00:31:50,544
Do you remember
what Mama's very first name was?

259
00:31:50,653 --> 00:31:53,554
- Mary.
- No, I know.

260
00:31:53,656 --> 00:31:57,251
I mean, uh, her--
before she found Daddy.

261
00:31:57,359 --> 00:31:59,953
- Her maiden name?
- Yeah.

262
00:32:00,062 --> 00:32:02,496
You don't remember her maiden name?

263
00:32:02,598 --> 00:32:04,657
No.

264
00:32:04,767 --> 00:32:07,327
Zaquine.

265
00:32:07,436 --> 00:32:10,405
Zaquine. Yeah, Spanish.

266
00:32:10,506 --> 00:32:13,304
- Her father was.
- Yeah?

267
00:32:19,748 --> 00:32:21,716
I don't believe it.

268
00:32:23,252 --> 00:32:25,243
You finally decided to eat.

269
00:32:26,288 --> 00:32:28,415
Eating and talking.

270
00:32:28,524 --> 00:32:31,322
Before you know it, you'll be back
in the land of the living, Trav.

271
00:32:35,731 --> 00:32:37,756
You want me to drive?

272
00:32:37,866 --> 00:32:40,699
Sure. You think you remember how?

273
00:32:40,803 --> 00:32:42,771
My body remembers.

274
00:32:47,743 --> 00:32:50,678
You can sleep while I drive.

275
00:32:50,779 --> 00:32:52,576
Okay.

276
00:33:06,695 --> 00:33:09,220
Well, Trav...

277
00:33:09,331 --> 00:33:11,822
think maybe you're ready to...

278
00:33:11,934 --> 00:33:14,425
tell me what the hell happened to you
over the last four years?

279
00:33:16,772 --> 00:33:18,740
No, not yet.

280
00:33:54,176 --> 00:33:55,473
Travis?

281
00:33:55,577 --> 00:33:57,545
What?

282
00:34:11,460 --> 00:34:16,989
Where are we, Travis? What happened?

283
00:34:17,099 --> 00:34:19,567
Why'd we get off the highway?

284
00:34:19,668 --> 00:34:21,602
Jesus Christ.

285
00:34:21,703 --> 00:34:24,365
I can't even sleep for five minutes
without some crisis.

286
00:34:24,473 --> 00:34:26,441
Why'd you turn off?

287
00:34:29,511 --> 00:34:32,480
I don't know where I turned off.
Didn't have a name.

288
00:34:35,017 --> 00:34:38,418
That's great. That's just dandy.

289
00:34:38,520 --> 00:34:42,217
Here we are in the middle of the Mojave Desert
in a place that doesn't have a name.

290
00:34:44,560 --> 00:34:46,528
I can find the highway again.

291
00:35:07,950 --> 00:35:11,010
Trav, I need to talk to you
a little bit about Hunter.

292
00:35:11,120 --> 00:35:13,088
How old is he now?

293
00:35:13,188 --> 00:35:16,646
He's eight in January.

294
00:35:16,758 --> 00:35:18,749
- He's seven then.
- Yeah.

295
00:35:19,928 --> 00:35:23,762
See, what I wanna talk about is, uh --

296
00:35:23,866 --> 00:35:28,997
Well, he's -- he's like part of the family now.

297
00:35:30,906 --> 00:35:33,340
Anne and me are like his parents now.

298
00:35:34,510 --> 00:35:37,775
- Anne's your wife.
- Yeah. You remember her, don't you?

299
00:35:37,880 --> 00:35:40,849
No. Does he think that you're his father?

300
00:35:42,784 --> 00:35:46,720
Well --Anne told him you were coming.

301
00:35:48,490 --> 00:35:50,253
Well, who does he think I am?

302
00:35:50,359 --> 00:35:54,523
I -- I told him you're his father.

303
00:35:55,631 --> 00:35:57,963
But, see --

304
00:35:58,066 --> 00:36:00,591
Well, you've been gone a long time, Trav.

305
00:36:00,702 --> 00:36:03,398
How long have I been gone?
Do you know?

306
00:36:04,940 --> 00:36:07,170
Four years.

307
00:36:07,276 --> 00:36:09,870
Is four years a long time?

308
00:36:11,780 --> 00:36:14,271
Well, it is for a little boy.

309
00:36:16,218 --> 00:36:17,913
It's half his life.

310
00:36:19,955 --> 00:36:21,855
Half a boy's life.

311
00:36:25,594 --> 00:36:28,757
- I remember now.
<i>- What?</i>

312
00:36:32,201 --> 00:36:35,466
- Why I bought that land.
<i>- Oh. Why?</i>

313
00:36:35,571 --> 00:36:39,302
Well, Mama once told me that, uh...

314
00:36:39,408 --> 00:36:43,174
that's where she and Daddy
first, uh, made love.

315
00:36:44,479 --> 00:36:48,210
<i>- Oh. ln Paris, Texas?</i>
- Yeah.

316
00:36:48,317 --> 00:36:50,308
<i>- She told you that?</i>
- Yeah.

317
00:36:52,487 --> 00:36:54,387
So...

318
00:36:55,757 --> 00:36:59,056
I figured that that's where I -- I began.

319
00:36:59,161 --> 00:37:02,927
<i>I-I mean me, Travis Clay Henderson.</i>

320
00:37:03,031 --> 00:37:05,829
<i>They named me that.</i>

321
00:37:05,934 --> 00:37:07,834
<i>I started out there.</i>

322
00:37:09,504 --> 00:37:12,234
<i>- Paris, Texas, huh?</i>
<i>- Yeah.</i>

323
00:37:16,311 --> 00:37:18,541
So, you think maybe
you were conceived there?

324
00:37:20,215 --> 00:37:23,446
<i>- Yeah.</i>
- Well, you could be right, Travis.

325
00:37:25,287 --> 00:37:27,517
Daddy always had a joke about it.

326
00:37:28,557 --> 00:37:31,185
<i>What was the joke?</i>

327
00:37:31,293 --> 00:37:35,855
He, uh -- He would introduce Mama
as the girl he met in Paris.

328
00:37:36,898 --> 00:37:41,335
And then he'd wait, uh,
before he said "Texas"...

329
00:37:41,436 --> 00:37:46,100
till everybody thought that... he meant --

330
00:37:46,208 --> 00:37:49,507
He would wait before he said "Texas"
till everybody thought --

331
00:37:49,611 --> 00:37:53,103
after everybody thought he was
talking about Paris, France.

332
00:37:53,215 --> 00:37:55,513
He-He always laughed real hard about it.

333
00:37:58,820 --> 00:38:01,618
<i>So you live in</i> Los Angeles, <i>huh?</i>

334
00:38:01,723 --> 00:38:06,251
Well, we live in the suburbs,
but I got my business in town.

335
00:38:06,361 --> 00:38:08,352
<i>Yeah? What's your business?</i>

336
00:38:08,463 --> 00:38:10,795
I make billboard signs for advertising.

337
00:38:11,933 --> 00:38:15,664
<i>Oh, yeah. So</i> you're <i>the one</i>
<i>who makes those, huh?</i>

338
00:38:15,771 --> 00:38:18,604
<i>I love those.</i>
<i>Some of them are beautiful.</i>

339
00:38:18,707 --> 00:38:21,437
I'm not the only one in the world
that makes 'em, Trav.

340
00:38:45,267 --> 00:38:47,735
Trav? This way.

341
00:38:47,836 --> 00:38:50,862
Nice, huh? Just been in here three months.

342
00:38:50,972 --> 00:38:54,601
I really like it, but I took a beating
on the financing, I tell ya.

343
00:38:54,710 --> 00:38:57,941
Like everybody else nowadays, I guess.

344
00:39:03,885 --> 00:39:07,651
Hi, baby.
Mmm, everything okay here?

345
00:39:07,756 --> 00:39:10,247
Oh, sure. We just missed you a lot.

346
00:39:10,359 --> 00:39:13,351
Yeah. I missed you too.

347
00:39:13,462 --> 00:39:15,487
- Come on in.
- Travis.

348
00:39:20,602 --> 00:39:22,536
My God.

349
00:39:22,637 --> 00:39:26,334
We were beginning to wonder
if we'd ever see you again.

350
00:39:26,441 --> 00:39:29,001
It's been so long.

351
00:39:29,111 --> 00:39:31,545
Did you have a good trip?

352
00:39:31,646 --> 00:39:33,614
Yeah, it was fine.

353
00:39:36,718 --> 00:39:38,618
Hunter?

354
00:39:49,531 --> 00:39:53,763
Hunter, this is Travis.

355
00:40:07,616 --> 00:40:09,516
Hi.

356
00:40:11,787 --> 00:40:13,982
Hi.

357
00:40:22,564 --> 00:40:26,000
I bet it was really hot coming across
the Mojave Desert.

358
00:40:28,437 --> 00:40:30,667
Yes.

359
00:40:30,772 --> 00:40:32,967
Too bad you had to drive.

360
00:40:33,074 --> 00:40:35,565
<i>What happened?</i>

361
00:40:35,677 --> 00:40:39,135
<i>Well, Travis just, uh, didn't feel like flying.</i>

362
00:40:39,247 --> 00:40:41,044
Oh, I don't blame you.

363
00:40:41,149 --> 00:40:46,177
I can't stand airplanes anymore,
especially since we live in this house.

364
00:40:46,288 --> 00:40:49,655
<i>All we hear is planes</i>
<i>day in and day out.</i>

365
00:40:49,758 --> 00:40:52,158
I like 'em.

366
00:40:59,067 --> 00:41:01,399
You used to fly, didn't you, Travis?

367
00:41:03,538 --> 00:41:05,768
No.

368
00:41:06,908 --> 00:41:11,538
Oh. I thought I remembered Jane
telling me once...

369
00:41:11,646 --> 00:41:16,674
<i>that you flew to Dallas together...</i>
<i>or somewhere.</i>

370
00:41:16,785 --> 00:41:19,083
Um --

371
00:41:19,187 --> 00:41:21,087
Maybe I'm mistaken.

372
00:41:41,710 --> 00:41:46,841
<i>Honey, he hasn't slept in a bed</i>
<i>since we started for here. I swear to God.</i>

373
00:41:46,948 --> 00:41:49,280
I don't think that's even necessary.

374
00:41:49,384 --> 00:41:51,682
Where has he been sleeping then?

375
00:41:51,786 --> 00:41:54,687
Well, he doesn't sleep.

376
00:41:54,789 --> 00:41:57,053
He has to sleep somewhere.

377
00:41:57,158 --> 00:42:01,254
Okay, but I don't think
he's even gonna use it.

378
00:42:01,363 --> 00:42:03,388
He's got to get tired sometime.

379
00:42:07,469 --> 00:42:10,438
Oh. There is a towel for you, Travis.

380
00:42:10,539 --> 00:42:13,702
And some underwear
and socks from Walt.

381
00:42:13,808 --> 00:42:15,969
- Oh.
- Good night.

382
00:42:16,077 --> 00:42:18,568
Good night.

383
00:42:18,680 --> 00:42:20,648
Thank you.

384
00:42:22,017 --> 00:42:25,145
Okay.

385
00:42:25,253 --> 00:42:27,813
Get some shut-eye.

386
00:42:27,923 --> 00:42:30,187
Okay.

387
00:42:30,292 --> 00:42:32,192
- Sweet dreams.
- All right.

388
00:43:41,429 --> 00:43:43,397
You polished them.

389
00:43:45,567 --> 00:43:48,331
That's very nice of you, Travis.

390
00:43:49,471 --> 00:43:51,939
Would you like to come in
and have some breakfast?

391
00:43:54,275 --> 00:43:56,175
Aren't you hungry?

392
00:43:57,212 --> 00:44:00,340
We are going to have strawberry waffles.

393
00:44:00,448 --> 00:44:02,814
Do you like them?

394
00:44:02,917 --> 00:44:04,817
Do you want some?

395
00:44:13,862 --> 00:44:17,730
<i>Well, there is hot coffee on the stove</i>
<i>if you want some.</i>

396
00:44:20,735 --> 00:44:22,703
Look at that truck.

397
00:45:00,875 --> 00:45:02,467
Hi.

398
00:45:37,846 --> 00:45:40,713
- Decided to rough it, huh?
- Yeah.

399
00:45:42,083 --> 00:45:43,983
What'd you do -- spit-shine these?

400
00:45:44,085 --> 00:45:45,985
I can get you a job at the airport
doing that.

401
00:45:47,722 --> 00:45:52,216
Hey. You wanna trade these new boots
for those old boots?

402
00:45:52,327 --> 00:45:54,454
Yeah, you can wear 'em.

403
00:45:56,831 --> 00:45:58,731
Thank you.

404
00:46:24,759 --> 00:46:26,693
<i>Travis?</i>

405
00:46:26,795 --> 00:46:30,390
<i>I have to rush off</i>
<i>to get Hunter to school on time.</i>

406
00:46:30,498 --> 00:46:32,489
We will be back this afternoon.

407
00:46:32,600 --> 00:46:35,535
Walt's office number
is on the dining room table.

408
00:46:35,637 --> 00:46:37,605
See you later.

409
00:46:37,705 --> 00:46:39,502
- Okay.
<i>- Bye.</i>

410
00:47:13,975 --> 00:47:15,875
- Anne?
<i>- Yeah?</i>

411
00:47:15,977 --> 00:47:19,310
I was just thinking. Maybe, uh, I can
meet Hunter after school...

412
00:47:19,414 --> 00:47:21,746
and we could walk home together
if he wants to.

413
00:47:21,850 --> 00:47:24,717
Oh, that sounds like a great idea, Travis.

414
00:47:26,287 --> 00:47:29,723
<i>Walk home?</i>
<i>I don't wanna walk home, Mom.</i>

415
00:47:31,059 --> 00:47:34,153
- Why?
- Nobody walks. Everybody drives.

416
00:47:34,262 --> 00:47:36,389
- Come on, Hunter.
- No.

417
00:47:36,497 --> 00:47:38,294
It won't hurt you to walk home
once in your life.

418
00:47:38,399 --> 00:47:42,096
- No, no. I don't want to.
<i>- I don't wanna walk, Mom. Everybody else--</i>

419
00:47:42,203 --> 00:47:44,296
- Travis, I insist. He'll wait for you out in front.
- Everybody will see me.

420
00:47:44,405 --> 00:47:47,602
<i>Walt can tell you how to get there.</i>
<i>It's not far.</i>

421
00:47:47,709 --> 00:47:50,109
And get in the car, Hunter.
We are late as it is.

422
00:47:54,983 --> 00:47:56,883
<i>You're mean.</i>

423
00:48:43,264 --> 00:48:45,630
Awesome!

424
00:48:51,773 --> 00:48:53,673
<i>I flunked kindergarten.</i>

425
00:48:59,047 --> 00:49:01,447
- Can I come with you?
- Sure.

426
00:49:39,821 --> 00:49:42,187
<i>I’m really sorry about this, Travis.</i>

427
00:49:43,725 --> 00:49:46,694
It's not easy for him, Anne.

428
00:49:52,934 --> 00:49:54,993
Anne, it's okay. He's in here.

429
00:50:03,044 --> 00:50:04,944
What are you doin'?

430
00:50:05,046 --> 00:50:07,241
Driving.

431
00:50:07,348 --> 00:50:11,307
- Where to?
-Just driving.

432
00:50:11,419 --> 00:50:14,047
You're not hiding out in there, are you?

433
00:50:14,155 --> 00:50:16,123
No.

434
00:50:20,995 --> 00:50:24,931
Hunter, Travis is your real dad.
You know that, don't you?

435
00:50:27,201 --> 00:50:31,035
Dad, when are they gonna make spaceships
like they make cars?

436
00:50:33,908 --> 00:50:36,741
Hunter, I'm asking you a question.
Can you answer it?

437
00:50:36,844 --> 00:50:38,937
What?

438
00:50:42,050 --> 00:50:47,420
Well, Travis went to meet you at school,
and he wanted to walk you home.

439
00:50:47,522 --> 00:50:50,355
Nobody walks.

440
00:50:50,458 --> 00:50:52,619
That's not the point.

441
00:50:52,727 --> 00:50:57,824
<i>Travis is your real dad,</i>
<i>and he wants to talk to you.</i>

442
00:51:00,802 --> 00:51:02,997
Why? What about?

443
00:51:04,972 --> 00:51:08,271
Okay, come on.
Let's go have dinner. Come on.

444
00:51:18,019 --> 00:51:20,010
Hey, Trav, do you remember the time...

445
00:51:20,121 --> 00:51:23,181
that Anne and me came down to visit you
about five years ago?

446
00:51:24,892 --> 00:51:27,326
No.

447
00:51:27,428 --> 00:51:30,522
You and Jane were down in Texas,
right there on the coast.

448
00:51:30,631 --> 00:51:35,193
<i>Hunter was about three.</i>
<i>Don't you remember that?</i>

449
00:51:38,806 --> 00:51:42,298
- No.
- I remember. We went fishing.

450
00:51:43,244 --> 00:51:48,147
<i>Yeah. I took some Super 8 on that trip.</i>
<i>And I put it all together.</i>

451
00:51:48,249 --> 00:51:49,910
I thought maybe you might like
to see some of it.

452
00:51:50,017 --> 00:51:52,144
Wh-What is it?

453
00:51:52,253 --> 00:51:54,380
Movies. You know, Super 8.

454
00:51:54,489 --> 00:51:56,047
Oh.

455
00:51:56,157 --> 00:51:59,490
<i>Walt, maybe Travis doesn't want--</i>

456
00:51:59,594 --> 00:52:02,222
What?

457
00:52:03,097 --> 00:52:06,999
Well, maybe he'd like to wait a while
before he looks at it.

458
00:52:07,101 --> 00:52:10,502
Well, it's up to him.

459
00:52:10,605 --> 00:52:12,630
I just thought maybe
you'd like to see some of it.

460
00:52:12,740 --> 00:52:15,038
Movies? Sure.

461
00:52:15,143 --> 00:52:17,236
<i>Great. There's some great stuff in it.</i>

462
00:52:17,345 --> 00:52:19,370
Some great shots of Hunter in it.

463
00:52:19,480 --> 00:52:21,505
I've already seen it.

464
00:52:21,616 --> 00:52:24,608
Well, you have to see it again.

465
00:52:24,719 --> 00:52:27,586
- Come on. Help me set up the projector.
- Okay.

466
00:53:55,209 --> 00:53:59,373
- That's me driving.
- I know. You're gonna be good.

467
00:57:04,064 --> 00:57:06,055
Time for bed now, Hunter.

468
00:57:06,167 --> 00:57:09,261
Aw, Mom.

469
00:57:09,370 --> 00:57:11,338
Don't complain. It's past 10.00.

470
00:57:13,874 --> 00:57:15,774
- Good night, Dad.
- Good night, baby.

471
00:57:15,876 --> 00:57:17,571
Mmm.

472
00:57:22,049 --> 00:57:24,017
Good night, Dad.

473
00:57:29,356 --> 00:57:32,325
Do you think he still loves her?

474
00:57:32,426 --> 00:57:35,361
How would I know that, Hunter?

475
00:57:35,463 --> 00:57:37,431
I think he does.

476
00:57:38,866 --> 00:57:42,563
- How can you tell?
- Well, the way he looked at her.

477
00:57:42,670 --> 00:57:45,036
You mean when he saw her
in the movie?

478
00:57:45,139 --> 00:57:48,199
Yeah, but that's not her.

479
00:57:48,309 --> 00:57:50,777
What do you mean?

480
00:57:50,878 --> 00:57:52,846
That's only her in a movie...

481
00:57:54,381 --> 00:57:57,077
a long time ago...

482
00:57:57,184 --> 00:58:00,950
in a galaxy far, far away.

483
00:58:37,391 --> 00:58:41,191
- What are you looking for?
- Uh, I'm looking for...

484
00:58:41,295 --> 00:58:43,729
uh, <i>the</i> father.

485
00:58:43,831 --> 00:58:48,530
- Your father?
- No, no. Just a father. Any father.

486
00:58:48,636 --> 00:58:50,627
What does a father look like?

487
00:58:50,738 --> 00:58:53,730
There are many different kinds
of fathers, señor Travis.

488
00:58:53,841 --> 00:58:55,900
Well, I just -- I just need one.

489
00:58:56,010 --> 00:58:59,810
- You think you're gonna find him in there?
- Well, I don't know where else to look.

490
00:58:59,914 --> 00:59:03,315
Oh, I see. You want to look like a father.

491
00:59:03,417 --> 00:59:05,112
- Yeah.
- Mmm.

492
00:59:05,219 --> 00:59:07,119
<i>Ahora.</i> Tell me.

493
00:59:07,221 --> 00:59:10,122
Do you want to be a rich father?

494
00:59:10,224 --> 00:59:12,522
Uh, no.

495
00:59:12,626 --> 00:59:14,719
- A poor one?
- No.

496
00:59:14,828 --> 00:59:16,819
<i>Rues, ¿cómo pues?</i>

497
00:59:16,931 --> 00:59:20,890
- Uh, in between.
- No, no. There is no in between, huh?

498
00:59:21,001 --> 00:59:23,333
You either have to be a rich father
or a poor one.

499
00:59:23,437 --> 00:59:25,337
- Rich.
- <i>Bueno.</i>

500
00:59:25,439 --> 00:59:27,407
<i>Un momento. A ver.</i>

501
00:59:28,576 --> 00:59:30,737
<i>Ahora, sí.</i> Okay.

502
00:59:31,779 --> 00:59:33,770
<i>A ver.</i> Huh?

503
00:59:38,218 --> 00:59:40,277
<i>-¿Qué tal? ¿Eh?</i>
<i>- Está bueno.</i>

504
00:59:40,387 --> 00:59:42,855
Okay. One thing you must remember.

505
00:59:42,957 --> 00:59:45,255
To be a rich father, señor Travis...

506
00:59:45,359 --> 00:59:48,328
you must look to the sky
and never at the ground, eh?

507
00:59:48,429 --> 00:59:50,420
<i>Mire.</i>

508
00:59:50,531 --> 00:59:52,089
Little higher.

509
00:59:52,199 --> 00:59:54,133
<i>Eso.</i> Mm-hmm.

510
00:59:54,234 --> 00:59:56,225
<i>Ahora. Camine.</i>

511
01:00:00,207 --> 01:00:03,074
<i>No. Este--</i>

512
01:00:03,177 --> 01:00:05,145
You must walk stiff, señor Travis.

513
01:00:09,216 --> 01:00:11,480
<i>Con confianza. ¿Me entiende?</i>

514
01:00:11,585 --> 01:00:13,712
<i>Um, con respeto.</i>

515
01:00:13,821 --> 01:00:15,948
- Uh, dignity.
<i>- Eso.</i>

516
01:00:16,056 --> 01:00:18,490
<i>Con dignidad.</i>

517
01:00:18,592 --> 01:00:20,492
<i>Ahora.</i>

518
01:00:28,202 --> 01:00:30,170
Mm-hmm.

519
01:00:32,573 --> 01:00:34,564
You got it.

520
01:00:54,428 --> 01:00:56,396
Who is that guy?
You know him?

521
01:00:57,431 --> 01:00:59,695
Yeah. He's my father's brother.

522
01:01:02,302 --> 01:01:06,068
No. They're both brothers.

523
01:01:06,173 --> 01:01:09,540
No. they're both --
They're both fathers.

524
01:01:11,912 --> 01:01:13,903
No. Aw, forget it.

525
01:01:14,014 --> 01:01:16,983
- But both whose father?
- My father.

526
01:01:17,084 --> 01:01:19,416
How-How can you have two fathers?

527
01:01:19,520 --> 01:01:22,512
Just lucky, I guess.

528
01:01:22,623 --> 01:01:25,114
- Well, bye.
- Bye.

529
01:03:17,037 --> 01:03:18,937
<i>That's my dad's suit.</i>

530
01:03:20,207 --> 01:03:21,640
I mean Walt.

531
01:03:21,742 --> 01:03:23,710
That's okay if you call him "Dad."

532
01:03:24,878 --> 01:03:27,847
Yeah, I borrowed it from him.
He said it was okay.

533
01:03:33,287 --> 01:03:35,187
What are those pictures?

534
01:03:35,289 --> 01:03:37,189
That's my dad --

535
01:03:38,325 --> 01:03:40,555
and your grandfather.

536
01:03:44,164 --> 01:03:47,258
- What was his name?
- Travis.

537
01:03:47,367 --> 01:03:50,495
- Same as yours.
- Mm-hmm.

538
01:03:50,604 --> 01:03:52,504
Where is he now?

539
01:03:53,740 --> 01:03:57,904
He died... couple of years after this picture.

540
01:03:58,011 --> 01:03:59,911
In that car.

541
01:04:00,013 --> 01:04:02,174
- Oh. He's dead.
- Mm-hmm.

542
01:04:03,383 --> 01:04:06,284
But can you feel that he's dead?

543
01:04:06,386 --> 01:04:08,081
What do you mean?

544
01:04:08,188 --> 01:04:11,783
You know when he was walking around
and talking, right?

545
01:04:11,892 --> 01:04:15,157
- Yeah.
- So can you feel that he's gone?

546
01:04:17,064 --> 01:04:18,691
Yeah, sometimes.

547
01:04:18,799 --> 01:04:20,767
I know he's dead.

548
01:04:21,935 --> 01:04:24,369
I never felt like you were dead.

549
01:04:24,471 --> 01:04:28,703
I could always feel you walking around
and talking someplace.

550
01:04:28,809 --> 01:04:32,040
- Yeah?
- I feel Mom too.

551
01:04:32,145 --> 01:04:34,136
- You do?
- Don't you?

552
01:04:35,582 --> 01:04:37,482
Yeah.

553
01:04:40,254 --> 01:04:42,313
That's me when I was in the navy.

554
01:04:42,422 --> 01:04:44,515
<i>Hmm. You were a general?</i>

555
01:04:44,625 --> 01:04:46,991
No. That's when I was --

556
01:04:47,094 --> 01:04:48,527
That's when I was in the band.

557
01:04:48,629 --> 01:04:51,257
- Oh.
- The high school band.

558
01:04:52,733 --> 01:04:54,462
Now, here's you.
I like this picture.

559
01:04:54,568 --> 01:04:58,470
That -- Look at that.
That is really wild.

560
01:04:58,572 --> 01:05:01,769
<i>It’s weird when it-- when it--</i>
<i>when there's water in between.</i>

561
01:05:01,875 --> 01:05:04,935
And then it turns into nothing.
Then it goes -- pshh.

562
01:05:05,045 --> 01:05:07,513
Yeah. That's a great picture.

563
01:05:07,614 --> 01:05:10,048
And this is my mom.

564
01:05:11,785 --> 01:05:13,753
Your grandmother.

565
01:05:18,525 --> 01:05:20,425
I don't know.

566
01:05:23,797 --> 01:05:27,824
It just seems like everything
has changed between us so fast --

567
01:05:27,935 --> 01:05:30,426
ever since Travis came.

568
01:05:30,537 --> 01:05:32,232
What's changed?

569
01:05:34,074 --> 01:05:35,974
I'm just afraid.

570
01:05:37,511 --> 01:05:41,003
- Afraid of Travis?
- No.

571
01:05:41,114 --> 01:05:43,014
Then what?

572
01:05:45,118 --> 01:05:48,315
Of what will happen to us
if we lose Hunter.

573
01:05:50,657 --> 01:05:53,490
We're not gonna lose Hunter.

574
01:05:53,593 --> 01:05:56,824
Then why do you keep
pushing them together?

575
01:05:56,930 --> 01:05:59,990
It's almost as if you wanted him to leave.

576
01:06:00,100 --> 01:06:03,695
<i>- Who?</i>
- Hunter.

577
01:06:03,804 --> 01:06:06,272
You know what I'm talking about.

578
01:06:06,373 --> 01:06:09,900
You keep promoting
this father-son business between them.

579
01:06:10,010 --> 01:06:12,137
It's not "business."

580
01:06:12,245 --> 01:06:16,045
Travis is his father,
and Hunter is his son.

581
01:06:16,149 --> 01:06:20,176
<i>That's a fact. We've known that all along.</i>

582
01:06:21,388 --> 01:06:24,824
<i>- Travis happens to be my brother.</i>
<i>-I know he is.</i>

583
01:06:24,925 --> 01:06:27,655
<i>Well, what's this promotion bullshit?</i>

584
01:06:27,761 --> 01:06:32,528
<i>You want us to go on pretending</i>
<i>that we're the parents of my brother's son?</i>

585
01:06:32,632 --> 01:06:34,793
<i>How long do you expect Hunter to buy that?</i>

586
01:06:34,901 --> 01:06:37,301
<i>I was never pretending.</i>

587
01:06:37,404 --> 01:06:41,238
<i>I love him, just like he was</i>
<i>my own flesh and blood.</i>

588
01:06:42,609 --> 01:06:44,577
<i>So do I.</i>

589
01:06:54,821 --> 01:06:58,120
- Hi, Anne.
- Hi, Travis.

590
01:06:58,225 --> 01:07:00,989
You don't sleep much, do you?

591
01:07:10,037 --> 01:07:12,631
Travis.

592
01:07:12,739 --> 01:07:14,900
There is something I have to tell you.

593
01:07:15,008 --> 01:07:20,378
I was not going to, because somehow
it makes things easier that nobody knows.

594
01:07:21,715 --> 01:07:24,684
I never even told Walt or Hunter.

595
01:07:26,253 --> 01:07:28,221
Well, what is it?

596
01:07:30,424 --> 01:07:33,621
After Hunter came to live with us...

597
01:07:33,727 --> 01:07:37,788
Jane used to call asking about him.

598
01:07:39,199 --> 01:07:43,533
<i>She made me promise</i>
<i>not to tell anyone she was calling.</i>

599
01:07:43,637 --> 01:07:45,605
<i>Did she ask about me?</i>

600
01:07:48,208 --> 01:07:50,733
Yes, in the beginning.

601
01:07:54,881 --> 01:07:57,645
Where did she call from?

602
01:07:57,751 --> 01:07:59,685
Places in Texas.

603
01:07:59,786 --> 01:08:01,686
What places?

604
01:08:05,058 --> 01:08:06,958
Let me finish, Travis.

605
01:08:09,796 --> 01:08:14,028
After what happened
between you and Jane...

606
01:08:14,134 --> 01:08:16,625
she decided Hunter should be with us.

607
01:08:18,472 --> 01:08:21,134
She said she couldn't be a mother
to him anymore.

608
01:08:29,249 --> 01:08:32,377
She stopped being a mother to him
a long time before that.

609
01:08:45,365 --> 01:08:49,665
Travis, I don't want to feel
I'm hiding something.

610
01:08:56,710 --> 01:08:58,735
She was young.

611
01:09:03,717 --> 01:09:07,084
She wanted something.
I just couldn't figure out what it was.

612
01:09:14,494 --> 01:09:17,725
I just didn't realize
how much rage I had.

613
01:09:26,006 --> 01:09:29,373
A little more than a year ago,
she stopped calling.

614
01:09:29,476 --> 01:09:31,706
I haven't heard from her since then.

615
01:09:32,846 --> 01:09:34,746
Nothing?

616
01:09:36,049 --> 01:09:38,415
Not a word.

617
01:09:38,518 --> 01:09:40,418
But on the last call...

618
01:09:41,555 --> 01:09:44,718
she asked me to open a bank account
for Hunter.

619
01:09:45,992 --> 01:09:47,459
A bank account?

620
01:09:47,561 --> 01:09:50,359
All I know about Jane now is...

621
01:09:51,531 --> 01:09:56,491
she goes to this bank
on the fifth of each month...

622
01:09:56,603 --> 01:09:59,071
and wires money for Hunter.

623
01:10:03,410 --> 01:10:06,174
Jane still sends him money?

624
01:10:06,279 --> 01:10:09,009
Sometimes a hundred dollars.

625
01:10:09,115 --> 01:10:12,278
Sometimes 50 or five.

626
01:10:12,385 --> 01:10:14,910
For Hunter's future.

627
01:10:15,021 --> 01:10:17,216
I had the bank trace the wire.

628
01:10:18,458 --> 01:10:20,426
It comes from a bank in Houston.

629
01:10:20,527 --> 01:10:22,119
What bank?

630
01:10:23,763 --> 01:10:26,994
I wrote it down if you want it.

631
01:10:30,036 --> 01:10:34,097
- What's the date today?
- The first of November.

632
01:10:38,945 --> 01:10:41,675
"I don't think we should do that anymore."
"You're right."

633
01:10:43,950 --> 01:10:47,681
"Heh. I meant the other thing." "Oh."

634
01:11:06,339 --> 01:11:11,208
<i>You will all be caught with your diapers down!</i>

635
01:11:11,311 --> 01:11:13,541
<i>That is a promise!</i>

636
01:11:13,647 --> 01:11:18,175
<i>I make you this promise</i>
<i>on my mother's head!</i>

637
01:11:18,285 --> 01:11:24,053
<i>For right here, today,</i>
<i>standing on the very head of my mother...</i>

638
01:11:24,157 --> 01:11:27,183
<i>which is now on God's green earth...</i>

639
01:11:27,294 --> 01:11:31,025
<i>which everybody who wasn't born</i>
<i>in a fuckin' sewer...</i>

640
01:11:31,131 --> 01:11:35,932
<i>ought to know and understand</i>
<i>to the very marrow of their bones!</i>

641
01:11:37,437 --> 01:11:40,838
<i>They will invade you in your beds!</i>

642
01:11:40,940 --> 01:11:44,671
<i>They will snatch you from your hot tubs!</i>

643
01:11:44,778 --> 01:11:49,613
<i>They will pluck you right out</i>
<i>of your fancy sports cars!</i>

644
01:11:49,716 --> 01:11:51,911
<i>There is nowhere...</i>

645
01:11:53,953 --> 01:11:59,414
<i>absolutely nowhere</i>
<i>in this godforsaken valley--</i>

646
01:11:59,526 --> 01:12:04,463
<i>I’m talking about from the range</i>
<i>of my voice right here...</i>

647
01:12:04,564 --> 01:12:09,934
<i>clear out to the goddamn Mojave Desert</i>
<i>and beyond that--</i>

648
01:12:10,036 --> 01:12:12,630
<i>clear out past Barstow...</i>

649
01:12:13,740 --> 01:12:17,767
<i>and everywhere else in the valley</i>
<i>all the way to Arizona.</i>

650
01:12:17,877 --> 01:12:21,643
None of that area
will be called a safety zone!

651
01:12:21,748 --> 01:12:23,909
There will be no safety zone!

652
01:12:24,017 --> 01:12:27,919
I can guarantee you the safety zone
will be eliminated!

653
01:12:28,021 --> 01:12:30,353
Eradicated!

654
01:12:30,457 --> 01:12:35,724
You will all be extradited
to the land of no return!

655
01:12:35,829 --> 01:12:38,992
It's a navigation to nowhere!

656
01:12:39,099 --> 01:12:42,068
And if you think that's going to be fun...

657
01:12:42,168 --> 01:12:45,137
you've got another thing comin'.

658
01:12:46,406 --> 01:12:48,806
I may be a slime bucket...

659
01:12:48,908 --> 01:12:50,808
but believe me...

660
01:12:50,910 --> 01:12:53,811
<i>I know what the hell I’m talking about!</i>

661
01:12:53,913 --> 01:12:56,040
<i>I’m not crazy!</i>

662
01:12:56,149 --> 01:12:58,982
<i>And don't say I didn't warn you!</i>

663
01:12:59,085 --> 01:13:02,418
<i>I warned you! I warned all of you!</i>

664
01:13:13,533 --> 01:13:15,933
Thought you were afraid of heights.

665
01:13:16,035 --> 01:13:19,266
No, I'm not afraid of heights.
I'm afraid of falling.

666
01:13:19,372 --> 01:13:23,274
- Oh, yeah? Well, just don't look down.
- No.

667
01:13:23,376 --> 01:13:27,938
Uh, too bad things don't look the same
on the ground.

668
01:13:28,047 --> 01:13:29,947
What do you mean?

669
01:13:30,049 --> 01:13:33,450
Well, things are clearer up here.

670
01:13:34,754 --> 01:13:36,654
<i>Might clear things up.</i>

671
01:13:36,756 --> 01:13:39,657
<i>Yeah, I had a talk with Anne last night.</i>

672
01:13:39,759 --> 01:13:41,659
<i>Yeah, she's pretty upset.</i>

673
01:13:41,761 --> 01:13:43,729
Yeah, I know.

674
01:13:45,398 --> 01:13:47,298
I'm gonna leave.

675
01:13:47,400 --> 01:13:49,300
- What?
- I'm leaving.

676
01:13:49,402 --> 01:13:52,303
Hey, I didn't tell you this
in order to make you leave.

677
01:13:52,405 --> 01:13:54,396
- I'm not trying to get rid of you, Travis.
- I know that.

678
01:13:54,507 --> 01:13:58,739
What good is that gonna do?
That's not gonna solve anything.

679
01:13:58,845 --> 01:14:00,813
I'm gonna find Jane.

680
01:14:02,482 --> 01:14:04,177
How are you gonna do that?

681
01:14:04,284 --> 01:14:06,582
It's been four years.
She's completely disappeared.

682
01:14:06,686 --> 01:14:08,950
I tried to find her.
I tried everything. I couldn't find her.

683
01:14:09,055 --> 01:14:11,683
Yeah, well, I haven't tried yet.
I can find her.

684
01:14:11,791 --> 01:14:15,090
- What makes you so sure?
- I just know.

685
01:14:15,195 --> 01:14:18,096
- Can we go down now?
- No!

686
01:14:18,198 --> 01:14:22,259
Goddamn it!
You tell me what happened, Travis!

687
01:14:22,368 --> 01:14:24,734
I'm sick of this fuckin' mystery.

688
01:14:24,838 --> 01:14:28,274
I've been treating you like a spoiled kid
ever since I picked you up in the desert.

689
01:14:28,374 --> 01:14:31,502
Now you tell me
what happened with you and Jane!

690
01:14:32,545 --> 01:14:34,445
Shit!

691
01:14:34,547 --> 01:14:37,107
I know. It's none of my business.

692
01:14:38,318 --> 01:14:41,719
<i>Uh, I’m gonna need to take, uh...</i>

693
01:14:41,821 --> 01:14:44,790
<i>money, credit cards.</i>

694
01:14:44,891 --> 01:14:46,791
<i>All right, sure. You can have 'em.</i>

695
01:14:46,893 --> 01:14:49,726
<i>- You know you'll get it back.</i>
<i>- Forget that. You can have it.</i>

696
01:14:49,829 --> 01:14:52,297
<i>I’m gonna find her, Walt.</i>

697
01:15:17,490 --> 01:15:19,458
Hunter!

698
01:15:28,701 --> 01:15:30,498
Is that your car?

699
01:15:34,040 --> 01:15:37,441
Yep. Come on.

700
01:15:37,544 --> 01:15:39,739
Radical!

701
01:15:53,493 --> 01:15:55,620
This is not bad stuff.

702
01:15:57,196 --> 01:15:59,596
Anne puts it in lunch every day.

703
01:15:59,699 --> 01:16:02,600
<i>La vache qui rit.</i> Sticky.

704
01:16:02,702 --> 01:16:04,670
<i>La vache</i> what?

705
01:16:06,272 --> 01:16:08,240
<i>Rit. Rit.</i>

706
01:16:08,341 --> 01:16:10,468
<i>Rit. Rit.</i>

707
01:16:11,544 --> 01:16:13,512
I like it.

708
01:16:14,981 --> 01:16:17,211
- Dad?
- Yeah?

709
01:16:17,317 --> 01:16:19,785
Where'd you go all that time?

710
01:16:22,422 --> 01:16:24,322
Mexico.

711
01:16:24,424 --> 01:16:26,392
How come?

712
01:16:27,660 --> 01:16:30,322
I didn't know where else to go.

713
01:16:30,430 --> 01:16:33,126
Where did Mom go?

714
01:16:34,233 --> 01:16:36,133
I don't know.

715
01:16:36,235 --> 01:16:38,635
But right now, she's somewhere in Houston.

716
01:16:38,738 --> 01:16:41,002
That's where the space center is.

717
01:16:41,107 --> 01:16:43,075
Yeah.

718
01:16:44,777 --> 01:16:47,678
That's what I wanted to talk to you about.

719
01:16:47,780 --> 01:16:50,681
- I gotta go away now.
- Why?

720
01:16:50,783 --> 01:16:53,081
Because I'm gonna find her.

721
01:16:53,186 --> 01:16:55,347
What about me? You just found me.

722
01:16:55,455 --> 01:16:57,355
Can I come with?

723
01:17:01,094 --> 01:17:02,994
What about Walt and Anne?

724
01:17:03,096 --> 01:17:06,327
You mean we'd never come back here?

725
01:17:06,432 --> 01:17:08,491
Well, sure, but...

726
01:17:08,601 --> 01:17:10,933
I don't know when.

727
01:17:19,545 --> 01:17:21,513
I want to come with.

728
01:17:24,517 --> 01:17:27,953
I wanna find her too.
When do we go?

729
01:17:32,458 --> 01:17:34,358
Right now.

730
01:17:34,460 --> 01:17:36,587
Then come on. Let's go.

731
01:17:36,696 --> 01:17:39,597
First we gotta stop
and get supplies for the trip.

732
01:17:39,699 --> 01:17:41,667
Okay.

733
01:17:55,882 --> 01:17:59,716
We gotta buy jackets, T-shirts,
toothbrushes -- stuff like that.

734
01:17:59,819 --> 01:18:01,719
Maybe even walkie-talkies.

735
01:18:01,821 --> 01:18:03,721
Walkie-talkies? What for?

736
01:18:03,823 --> 01:18:05,791
Just in case.

737
01:18:15,001 --> 01:18:17,629
- Do you know what?
- What?

738
01:18:19,605 --> 01:18:21,505
This whole galaxy...

739
01:18:21,607 --> 01:18:23,507
the whole universe...

740
01:18:23,609 --> 01:18:27,909
used to be compressed
into a tiny spot this big.

741
01:18:28,014 --> 01:18:31,313
- And --And do you know what happened?
- What?

742
01:18:31,417 --> 01:18:34,181
It went --
and blew up.

743
01:18:34,287 --> 01:18:39,725
All the spar-- Everything went flying
all over the place and formed space.

744
01:18:39,826 --> 01:18:43,762
- It was just gas. It was floating around.
- The Earth was?

745
01:18:43,863 --> 01:18:46,525
Yeah. The Earth was really gas.

746
01:18:46,632 --> 01:18:50,090
And --And the sun formed,
and it was so hot that --

747
01:18:50,203 --> 01:18:54,435
that the Earth
just formed into one hard, big ball...

748
01:18:54,540 --> 01:18:58,135
- Yeah?
- of oceans -- nothing but ocean.

749
01:18:58,244 --> 01:19:00,371
- Yeah?
- So there was sea animals.

750
01:19:00,480 --> 01:19:05,179
Then under the water, a volcano went --

751
01:19:05,284 --> 01:19:10,984
And the hot lava hit the water
and formed rock to make land.

752
01:19:22,835 --> 01:19:25,235
You know how to make a collect call?

753
01:19:25,338 --> 01:19:28,501
- You dial the operator and tell her that you're --
- I know.

754
01:19:28,608 --> 01:19:31,168
Good. Then call Walt and Anne.

755
01:19:31,277 --> 01:19:33,177
Why?

756
01:19:33,279 --> 01:19:36,715
Because -- So they don't worry about you,
so they know where you are.

757
01:19:36,816 --> 01:19:39,717
- What am I gonna say?
-Just tell 'em the truth.

758
01:19:39,819 --> 01:19:43,721
Tell 'em, uh, that you're with me
and that we're going to Texas.

759
01:19:43,823 --> 01:19:45,723
They're gonna flip out.

760
01:19:45,825 --> 01:19:48,726
I know. But you can handle it.

761
01:19:48,828 --> 01:19:51,592
- Okay?
- Why can't you do it?

762
01:19:51,697 --> 01:19:54,097
I can't do it.

763
01:19:54,200 --> 01:19:55,895
Why?

764
01:19:56,002 --> 01:19:58,493
Because it has to be you.

765
01:20:01,207 --> 01:20:03,107
Gee.

766
01:20:03,209 --> 01:20:05,541
Why can't he do it? I mean --

767
01:20:12,051 --> 01:20:13,951
- Hello?
- Hi, Dad.

768
01:20:14,053 --> 01:20:15,953
Hunter. Where are you?

769
01:20:16,055 --> 01:20:18,956
You know what time it is?
I've been calling everywhere looking for you.

770
01:20:19,058 --> 01:20:22,084
Travis got a truck. He was talking about --

771
01:20:22,195 --> 01:20:24,459
Yeah, yeah.
Hunter, just listen to me now.

772
01:20:24,564 --> 01:20:26,464
Where are you exactly?

773
01:20:26,566 --> 01:20:28,966
In San Bernardino.

774
01:20:29,068 --> 01:20:31,468
San Bernardino?

775
01:20:31,571 --> 01:20:34,472
Hunter, what do you mean
you're in San Bernardino?

776
01:20:34,574 --> 01:20:36,974
- Let me talk to him.
- Wait, honey. How did --

777
01:20:37,076 --> 01:20:38,976
- Let me talk to him.
- All right, all right.

778
01:20:39,078 --> 01:20:40,978
Hunter?

779
01:20:41,080 --> 01:20:42,980
Are you all right?

780
01:20:43,082 --> 01:20:44,982
Yeah.

781
01:20:45,084 --> 01:20:47,985
- What are you doing?
- I'm on a trip, Mom.

782
01:20:48,087 --> 01:20:49,987
- With Travis?
- Yeah.

783
01:20:50,089 --> 01:20:52,489
We bought some walkie-talkies,
and I --

784
01:20:52,592 --> 01:20:55,891
- Where are you going?
- We're on our way to Texas.

785
01:20:57,029 --> 01:20:58,860
Tell me where you are, Hunter.

786
01:20:58,965 --> 01:21:00,865
Just tell me where you are.

787
01:21:00,967 --> 01:21:02,867
We're at a gas station.

788
01:21:02,969 --> 01:21:04,869
What's the name of it?

789
01:21:04,971 --> 01:21:07,462
- Texaco.
- Oh, my God.

790
01:21:08,574 --> 01:21:13,068
<i>Hunter, you tell Travis to turn around...</i>

791
01:21:13,179 --> 01:21:15,943
<i>and come back here right now.</i>

792
01:21:16,048 --> 01:21:17,948
<i>Do you understand me?</i>

793
01:21:18,050 --> 01:21:20,018
<i>Let me talk to him.</i>

794
01:21:21,120 --> 01:21:22,849
What should I do?

795
01:21:22,955 --> 01:21:25,617
Just... hang up.

796
01:21:28,127 --> 01:21:30,288
Bye, Mom. Gotta go now.

797
01:21:31,564 --> 01:21:33,532
Hunter.

798
01:21:35,001 --> 01:21:36,969
Hunter!

799
01:21:53,152 --> 01:21:55,052
Did they flip out?

800
01:21:55,154 --> 01:21:57,054
Yeah, she did.

801
01:21:57,156 --> 01:21:59,989
- You're not sorry you came, are you?
- No.

802
01:22:00,092 --> 01:22:02,993
Well, you can go back to them
anytime you want.

803
01:22:03,095 --> 01:22:06,758
- You just tell me. Okay?
- I don't wanna go back.

804
01:22:06,866 --> 01:22:10,324
Well, I know, but just in case
you change your mind.

805
01:22:56,082 --> 01:22:59,074
I'm so used to calling her "Mom."

806
01:23:00,453 --> 01:23:02,353
Anne?

807
01:23:02,455 --> 01:23:04,423
Yeah.

808
01:23:09,362 --> 01:23:11,694
She sounded so sad.

809
01:23:14,700 --> 01:23:16,861
I know.

810
01:23:19,672 --> 01:23:22,641
What do you think Mom will look like now?

811
01:23:27,046 --> 01:23:29,014
I don't know.

812
01:23:31,650 --> 01:23:33,550
Do you remember her?

813
01:23:33,652 --> 01:23:35,552
Not really.

814
01:23:35,654 --> 01:23:38,452
Only from that little movie we saw.

815
01:23:47,666 --> 01:23:49,395
You look happy then.

816
01:23:50,503 --> 01:23:52,471
Yeah.

817
01:23:56,842 --> 01:23:59,902
Mm-mmm. You keep that.

818
01:24:17,963 --> 01:24:19,863
Night.

819
01:24:19,965 --> 01:24:21,933
Night.

820
01:25:00,973 --> 01:25:05,535
<i>Dad, if a guy put a baby down...</i>

821
01:25:05,644 --> 01:25:09,045
<i>traveled at the speed of light</i>
<i>for an hou--</i>

822
01:25:09,148 --> 01:25:12,049
If he traveled at the speed of light...

823
01:25:12,151 --> 01:25:15,052
he would --
he would come back in an hour.

824
01:25:15,154 --> 01:25:20,114
He would be an hour older,
but the little baby would be a very old man.

825
01:25:21,460 --> 01:25:23,360
Oh, yeah?

826
01:25:23,462 --> 01:25:26,431
Well, how long would it take him
to get to Houston?

827
01:25:28,367 --> 01:25:31,632
Uh, if-- if they were to travel --

828
01:25:31,737 --> 01:25:33,898
I'd say about three seconds.

829
01:25:35,241 --> 01:25:38,210
Uh, over.
I didn't get that last part.

830
01:25:40,012 --> 01:25:44,278
It would take them three seconds
to get from California to Houston...

831
01:25:44,383 --> 01:25:46,681
<i>on light speed.</i>

832
01:25:55,394 --> 01:25:58,227
<i>- This is Houston?</i>
<i>- Yep.</i>

833
01:25:58,330 --> 01:26:01,561
<i>How are we gonna find her</i>
<i>in a big city like this?</i>

834
01:26:01,667 --> 01:26:04,067
<i>- I know where she'll be.</i>
<i>- Where?</i>

835
01:26:04,170 --> 01:26:07,867
<i>A bank. She's going to deposit some money</i>
<i>in a certain bank today.</i>

836
01:26:11,343 --> 01:26:13,573
<i>This is a bank?</i>

837
01:26:13,679 --> 01:26:16,079
<i>What kind of bank is this?</i>

838
01:26:16,182 --> 01:26:18,082
<i>Looks like a drive-in.</i>

839
01:26:18,184 --> 01:26:21,085
<i>I’ve never seen a bank like that.</i>

840
01:26:21,187 --> 01:26:23,417
<i>Me neither.</i>

841
01:26:23,522 --> 01:26:26,923
<i>There'll be so many cars,</i>
<i>we'll never find her.</i>

842
01:26:27,026 --> 01:26:29,256
<i>Oh yeah, we will. Come on.</i>

843
01:26:29,361 --> 01:26:33,092
<i>W-We'll split up,</i>
<i>and then we'll cover more ground. Okay?</i>

844
01:26:33,199 --> 01:26:35,599
<i>Yeah. We could use the walkie-talkies.</i>

845
01:26:35,701 --> 01:26:37,601
<i>Hey. Now you're goin'.</i>

846
01:26:37,703 --> 01:26:40,433
<i>- I’ll let you out here.</i>
<i>- Okay.</i>

847
01:26:47,346 --> 01:26:49,405
Can you hear me, Dad? Over.

848
01:26:49,515 --> 01:26:51,415
Loud and clear.

849
01:26:51,517 --> 01:26:54,008
<i>Good.</i>

850
01:27:19,311 --> 01:27:21,336
Hunter in position one. Over.

851
01:27:21,447 --> 01:27:25,315
Travis in position two.
We got it covered.

852
01:27:25,417 --> 01:27:28,511
I told you these weren't toys.
Over.

853
01:27:28,621 --> 01:27:31,021
10-4. Over and out.

854
01:29:10,189 --> 01:29:13,090
Dad! She's just leaving the bank!

855
01:29:13,192 --> 01:29:15,092
Get over here!

856
01:29:15,194 --> 01:29:17,822
Dad, can you hear me?
Can you hear me?

857
01:29:23,202 --> 01:29:27,161
She's leaving the bank! Get over here!

858
01:29:27,272 --> 01:29:29,297
<i>Dad?</i>

859
01:29:29,408 --> 01:29:31,933
<i>Come on, Dad!</i>

860
01:29:32,044 --> 01:29:35,502
Wake up! Wake up! She's leaving!

861
01:29:35,614 --> 01:29:37,946
<i>She's leaving the bank!</i>

862
01:29:38,050 --> 01:29:39,642
Dad! Wake up!

863
01:29:40,753 --> 01:29:43,017
Wh-Where is sh --

864
01:29:43,122 --> 01:29:45,750
I-I'm on my way!

865
01:29:46,859 --> 01:29:49,350
Oh, no!

866
01:30:07,813 --> 01:30:09,713
She went that way!

867
01:30:09,815 --> 01:30:12,215
- Which way did she go?
- That way!

868
01:30:12,317 --> 01:30:15,218
You sure it's her?
Come on, come on, come on!

869
01:30:15,320 --> 01:30:17,288
Let's go!

870
01:30:32,738 --> 01:30:36,139
<i>Hunter, did you really</i>
<i>get a good look at her, or what?</i>

871
01:30:36,241 --> 01:30:38,801
<i>It must have been her. I know it was her.</i>

872
01:30:38,911 --> 01:30:41,812
<i>Oh, God, I hope we haven't lost her.</i>

873
01:30:41,914 --> 01:30:45,008
<i>Can't this piece of junk go faster?</i>

874
01:30:45,117 --> 01:30:48,018
<i>There's 10,000 cars here, Hunter.</i>
<i>How are we gonna find her?</i>

875
01:30:48,120 --> 01:30:51,351
- Which one is it?
- Go faster, Dad! Go faster!

876
01:30:51,457 --> 01:30:53,857
What col --W-What color--
The car was red, right?

877
01:30:53,959 --> 01:30:57,326
Yeah. A little red Chevy.

878
01:30:57,429 --> 01:30:59,397
Well --

879
01:31:00,966 --> 01:31:03,867
You see anything?
I don't know which one it looks like, Hunter.

880
01:31:03,969 --> 01:31:06,199
You'll have to help me.
Look. Can you see it?

881
01:31:06,305 --> 01:31:08,273
<i>No, not yet.</i>

882
01:31:10,709 --> 01:31:13,906
<i>- I see her! I see her!</i>
<i>- Where? Where?</i>

883
01:31:14,012 --> 01:31:16,572
Over in that lane! In that lane!

884
01:31:16,682 --> 01:31:18,707
- Which lane?
- The right one!

885
01:31:18,817 --> 01:31:21,445
<i>All right, all right.</i>
<i>Settle down. I see it.</i>

886
01:31:23,188 --> 01:31:24,883
<i>Okay.</i>

887
01:31:24,990 --> 01:31:27,686
Is that her? Look at --
See if it's her. Can you tell?

888
01:31:29,695 --> 01:31:32,391
<i>- I can't tell.</i>
<i>- Wait a minute.</i>

889
01:31:32,498 --> 01:31:36,958
There's two red cars now.
Which one is it?

890
01:31:37,069 --> 01:31:39,469
<i>- Huh?</i>
<i>- Uh, the right-- The left one!</i>

891
01:31:39,571 --> 01:31:41,300
- You sure?
- Yeah. The left one.

892
01:31:41,406 --> 01:31:45,035
Okay.

893
01:31:48,247 --> 01:31:51,216
<i>- You sure this is the one now?</i>
<i>- Yeah.</i>

894
01:31:55,621 --> 01:31:57,452
I hope you're right, Hunter.

895
01:31:57,556 --> 01:32:01,322
If we're following the wrong car,
we're gonna have to wait a whole other month.

896
01:32:01,426 --> 01:32:03,792
- I'll be eight then.
- You'll be what?

897
01:32:03,896 --> 01:32:05,796
I'll be eight then!

898
01:32:11,537 --> 01:32:13,937
<i>Let's get closer. We could wave!</i>

899
01:32:14,039 --> 01:32:16,803
No, no, no. We don't wanna get too close.

900
01:32:16,909 --> 01:32:19,742
We might scare her,
and she'd have a wreck or somethin'.

901
01:32:21,446 --> 01:32:23,346
<i>- Okay?</i>
<i>- Okay.</i>

902
01:32:23,448 --> 01:32:25,416
<i>I guess so.</i>

903
01:32:33,725 --> 01:32:35,693
Well --

904
01:32:35,794 --> 01:32:38,354
<i>I wonder where she's going.</i>

905
01:32:38,463 --> 01:32:41,694
<i>Maybe to work. What do you think?</i>

906
01:32:41,800 --> 01:32:43,768
<i>Yeah. Could be.</i>

907
01:33:54,306 --> 01:33:57,241
Looks like a girl's car to me.

908
01:33:57,342 --> 01:33:59,242
Could it be hers?

909
01:34:01,346 --> 01:34:04,110
Could be. Get in the truck,
and I'll tell you my plan.

910
01:34:04,216 --> 01:34:05,683
Okay.

911
01:34:13,191 --> 01:34:15,591
Roll the windows up, lock the doors.

912
01:34:15,694 --> 01:34:20,097
And if anybody talks to you, tell 'em
your daddy's inside and he'll be right back.

913
01:34:20,198 --> 01:34:22,098
- Okay?
- Okay.

914
01:34:22,200 --> 01:34:24,168
- You okay?
- Yep.

915
01:34:49,695 --> 01:34:52,163
<i>Could y'all put some ice on it?</i>
<i>I’m still rehearsing.</i>

916
01:34:52,264 --> 01:34:54,892
<i>Sergeant Jojo, call for you, Booth 22.</i>

917
01:34:55,000 --> 01:34:57,298
<i>Sergeant Jojo, Booth 22.</i>

918
01:34:57,402 --> 01:35:00,371
<i>Okay, new bit, new bit.</i>
<i>You guys are gonna love this.</i>

919
01:35:00,472 --> 01:35:03,771
<i>The girls here spend so much time with a guy</i>
<i>that most of them live alone.</i>

920
01:35:03,875 --> 01:35:06,241
<i>But it's tough living alone in a city like this.</i>

921
01:35:06,344 --> 01:35:07,936
<i>A lot of violent things happen here.</i>

922
01:35:08,046 --> 01:35:12,244
<i>Stuff like--like rape, like murder.</i>
<i>Especially from the police force.</i>

923
01:35:14,152 --> 01:35:17,417
<i>Uh, Tupperware parties -- violent things.</i>

924
01:35:17,522 --> 01:35:19,649
<i>And when you live alone,</i>
<i>you gotta think about...</i>

925
01:35:19,758 --> 01:35:21,658
<i>"Do I need some kind</i>
<i>of protection at home?"</i>

926
01:35:21,760 --> 01:35:25,560
<i>And if you're a girl, you can live with a guy</i>
<i>or you can live with a dog.</i>

927
01:35:25,664 --> 01:35:28,098
<i>That's a tough decision, let me tell you.</i>

928
01:35:28,200 --> 01:35:30,828
<i>- What normal-thinking adult wants to live...</i>
<i>- Nurse Bibs, you’re needed in Booth 7.</i>

929
01:35:30,936 --> 01:35:33,905
<i>- with something that hates to take a bath...</i>
<i>- Nurse Bibs, Booth 7.</i>

930
01:35:34,005 --> 01:35:38,135
<i>and that throws up on the carpet,</i>
<i>that chews on your underwear.</i>

931
01:35:38,243 --> 01:35:40,711
<i>Dogs, on the other hand, are real cute.</i>

932
01:35:40,812 --> 01:35:43,110
<i>They got cute little noses, cute little tails.</i>

933
01:35:43,215 --> 01:35:45,615
- Again?
- A lot of sick people out there.

934
01:35:45,717 --> 01:35:49,448
<i>- This looks like the dog act to me.</i>
<i>- Yeah, right.</i>

935
01:35:49,554 --> 01:35:53,320
Let's hear some rock 'n' roll.
Hey, how's it going?

936
01:35:53,425 --> 01:35:56,189
<i>Let's hear you play.</i>
<i>Give us something good.</i>

937
01:35:56,294 --> 01:35:58,489
<i>You're getting better all the time!</i>

938
01:36:11,576 --> 01:36:14,409
<i>-♪ There was a little girl♪</i>
<i>- Sir?</i>

939
01:36:14,513 --> 01:36:17,744
<i>-♪ Who lives in the wild♪</i>
- Sir, you're in the wrong place.

940
01:36:17,849 --> 01:36:21,148
<i>-♪ Who loved to complain!♪</i>
- It's too early.

941
01:36:21,253 --> 01:36:23,687
<i>All the girls are downstairs.</i>

942
01:36:23,789 --> 01:36:26,485
<i>Guys, this is the--</i>

943
01:36:26,591 --> 01:36:29,253
<i>Release get it right 'cause I’m getting--</i>
<i>I’m getting cranky.</i>

944
01:36:42,340 --> 01:36:44,535
<i>♪ There was a little girl!</i>

945
01:36:44,643 --> 01:36:47,237
<i>Mother Dana, call for you, Booth 19.</i>

946
01:36:47,345 --> 01:36:50,041
<i>Mother Dana, Booth 19.</i>

947
01:37:20,178 --> 01:37:22,078
<i>Hello?</i>

948
01:38:26,011 --> 01:38:27,979
Yeah. Who do you want?

949
01:38:28,079 --> 01:38:33,039
I want to see a blonde girl with kind of
short, straight hair, about 25 years old.

950
01:38:33,151 --> 01:38:37,110
Okay. She's coming down.
Stay on the line.

951
01:38:54,773 --> 01:38:57,071
Hello, honey.

952
01:38:59,277 --> 01:39:01,177
Oh, mercy.

953
01:39:01,279 --> 01:39:05,739
You know, 23 -- I've worked 23
of the 24 booths in this place.

954
01:39:05,850 --> 01:39:07,818
Uh --

955
01:39:07,919 --> 01:39:09,887
Poolside makes 24.

956
01:39:09,988 --> 01:39:12,957
So, what can I do for you today, hmm?

957
01:39:15,060 --> 01:39:17,085
I've got an idea.

958
01:39:17,195 --> 01:39:19,663
How about water polo?

959
01:39:20,899 --> 01:39:23,333
Having fun. Lots of fun.

960
01:39:24,803 --> 01:39:28,170
No? Uh, well, tell you what.

961
01:39:28,273 --> 01:39:31,174
Why don't you just tell, uh, Nurse Bibs
where the pain is?

962
01:39:31,276 --> 01:39:34,643
- Maybe I can find a cure, hmm?
- Why don't you look at me?

963
01:39:34,746 --> 01:39:36,714
I <i>am</i> looking at you.

964
01:39:36,815 --> 01:39:39,613
No, but I'm over here.
Can't you see me?

965
01:39:39,718 --> 01:39:43,711
Listen, sweetheart, if I could see you,
I wouldn't be working here.

966
01:39:43,822 --> 01:39:47,121
Well, what do you see?

967
01:39:47,225 --> 01:39:49,193
I see what you see.

968
01:39:49,294 --> 01:39:54,095
Nurse Bibs.
Nurse Bibs and a rubber horse.

969
01:39:54,199 --> 01:39:57,100
Oh. Oh, I see.

970
01:39:57,202 --> 01:40:00,968
Th-Thank you, Nurse Bibs.

971
01:40:01,072 --> 01:40:02,972
Thank you.

972
01:41:12,377 --> 01:41:15,505
<i>Hi.</i>

973
01:41:18,183 --> 01:41:20,151
<i>Are you out there?</i>

974
01:41:21,886 --> 01:41:26,346
<i>Well, I see your light's still on,</i>
<i>so I guess you must be out there.</i>

975
01:41:26,458 --> 01:41:28,358
<i>Hmm?</i>

976
01:41:30,895 --> 01:41:33,864
<i>It’s okay if you don't wanna talk, you know.</i>

977
01:41:33,965 --> 01:41:36,991
<i>I don't wanna talk either sometimes.</i>

978
01:41:37,102 --> 01:41:40,071
<i>I just like to stay silent.</i>

979
01:41:46,911 --> 01:41:49,379
<i>Do you mind if I sit down?</i>

980
01:41:58,356 --> 01:42:00,881
Do you mind if I sit down?

981
01:42:03,361 --> 01:42:05,829
<i>No.</i>

982
01:42:07,599 --> 01:42:09,499
Thanks.

983
01:42:09,601 --> 01:42:14,163
My legs get a little tired
from standing all the time.

984
01:42:16,741 --> 01:42:19,938
Is this your first visit here?

985
01:42:20,044 --> 01:42:24,344
<i>- Yes.</i>
- Oh!

986
01:42:24,449 --> 01:42:28,215
Well, this whole thing
must seem kind of strange to you, huh?

987
01:42:28,319 --> 01:42:32,119
You realize that I can't see you
even though you can see me?

988
01:42:32,223 --> 01:42:36,023
Well, that takes a little gettin' used to.

989
01:42:36,127 --> 01:42:38,027
Oh.

990
01:42:38,129 --> 01:42:41,587
<i>Am I--Am I looking at your face now?</i>

991
01:42:50,041 --> 01:42:53,010
<i>Oh, God. It don't matter.</i>

992
01:42:53,111 --> 01:42:55,875
<i>Oh.</i>

993
01:43:05,990 --> 01:43:08,220
If, um --

994
01:43:08,326 --> 01:43:11,591
If there's anything you wanna talk about,
I'll just listen.

995
01:43:11,696 --> 01:43:13,596
All right?

996
01:43:13,698 --> 01:43:17,156
<i>I’m a real good listener.</i>

997
01:43:30,014 --> 01:43:32,710
Is there somethin' --

998
01:43:32,817 --> 01:43:36,480
I don't know.
Is there somethin' I can do for you?

999
01:43:45,230 --> 01:43:48,199
Do you mind if I take off my sweater?

1000
01:43:49,934 --> 01:43:52,061
I'll just take off my sweater.

1001
01:43:52,170 --> 01:43:54,695
<i>No, no. No. Don't.</i>

1002
01:43:54,806 --> 01:43:57,138
<i>Please. Please leave it on.</i>

1003
01:44:04,882 --> 01:44:06,782
I'm sorry.

1004
01:44:10,888 --> 01:44:14,346
<i>I just don't know exactly what it is you want.</i>

1005
01:44:15,927 --> 01:44:18,395
I don't want anything.

1006
01:44:20,365 --> 01:44:23,391
<i>Well, why'd you come here then?</i>

1007
01:44:32,110 --> 01:44:34,578
I -- I want to talk to you.

1008
01:44:55,166 --> 01:44:58,135
Is there something you want to tell me?

1009
01:45:01,172 --> 01:45:03,197
<i>No.</i>

1010
01:45:07,679 --> 01:45:10,648
You can tell me. I can keep a secret.

1011
01:45:19,857 --> 01:45:24,920
<i>This, uh--ls that all you do is just talk?</i>

1012
01:45:29,367 --> 01:45:31,392
Well, yeah.

1013
01:45:33,004 --> 01:45:35,199
Yeah, mostly.

1014
01:45:35,306 --> 01:45:37,206
And listen.

1015
01:45:41,379 --> 01:45:43,847
<i>What else do you do?</i>

1016
01:45:54,158 --> 01:45:57,025
<i>- Why are you laughing?</i>
- I'm sorry.

1017
01:46:02,166 --> 01:46:04,600
I'm sorry.

1018
01:46:04,702 --> 01:46:07,170
<i>So what else do you do?</i>

1019
01:46:09,173 --> 01:46:11,073
Nothin' really.

1020
01:46:13,911 --> 01:46:17,005
Oh, well, we're not allowed
to see the customers out here.

1021
01:46:18,950 --> 01:46:21,510
Where do you see them then?

1022
01:46:21,619 --> 01:46:23,587
Do you go home with them?

1023
01:46:24,989 --> 01:46:26,957
No, sir, we don't.

1024
01:46:29,327 --> 01:46:33,127
We're not allowed to have any
outside relationships with the customers.

1025
01:46:33,231 --> 01:46:36,200
Yeah, but you can really see 'em
if you want to, can't you?

1026
01:46:36,300 --> 01:46:39,269
I mean, you can go home with 'em
if you want to. All these places say that.

1027
01:46:39,370 --> 01:46:43,830
How much extra money do you make? How much --
How much money do you make on the side?

1028
01:46:55,386 --> 01:46:59,823
I'm sorry, sir. I think you'll maybe
want to talk to one of the other girls.

1029
01:46:59,924 --> 01:47:02,188
I'll see if I can find one for you.

1030
01:47:02,293 --> 01:47:04,761
No. No, no, no!

1031
01:47:04,862 --> 01:47:06,830
Please. Please.

1032
01:47:08,433 --> 01:47:10,401
Please don't go.

1033
01:47:15,006 --> 01:47:18,203
I just don't think
I'm the one you want to talk to.

1034
01:47:20,645 --> 01:47:23,011
Please.

1035
01:47:23,114 --> 01:47:25,412
Please don't go. I'm sorry.

1036
01:47:34,125 --> 01:47:36,650
All right.

1037
01:47:42,366 --> 01:47:46,769
I'm, um -- I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

1038
01:47:51,742 --> 01:47:54,734
That's okay.

1039
01:48:03,154 --> 01:48:05,145
<i>You know, I--</i>

1040
01:48:05,256 --> 01:48:08,714
<i>I know how hard it is to talk</i>
<i>to strangers sometimes.</i>

1041
01:48:14,065 --> 01:48:15,965
<i>Just relax.</i>

1042
01:48:17,468 --> 01:48:19,868
<i>Relax and tell me what's on your mind.</i>

1043
01:48:22,240 --> 01:48:24,140
I'll listen...

1044
01:48:26,244 --> 01:48:28,144
to you.

1045
01:48:32,683 --> 01:48:35,151
I don't mind listening.

1046
01:48:43,094 --> 01:48:45,722
I do it all the time.

1047
01:49:06,817 --> 01:49:09,012
She was there, wasn't she?

1048
01:49:47,558 --> 01:49:49,458
<i>What's that?</i>

1049
01:49:54,932 --> 01:49:56,832
A vacant lot.

1050
01:49:56,934 --> 01:50:01,564
<i>I bought that land when we were all together,</i>
<i>with your mom.</i>

1051
01:50:04,609 --> 01:50:07,578
I thought we might live there someday.

1052
01:50:09,981 --> 01:50:11,676
Where?

1053
01:50:11,782 --> 01:50:14,979
<i>Paris, Texas.</i>

1054
01:50:15,086 --> 01:50:16,986
Where's that?

1055
01:50:18,322 --> 01:50:20,984
It's close to the Red River.

1056
01:50:25,396 --> 01:50:27,762
<i>Do you like it?</i>

1057
01:50:27,865 --> 01:50:30,390
You mean we'd live on dirt?

1058
01:50:45,583 --> 01:50:48,552
Why do you drink that stuff?
It stinks.

1059
01:50:50,521 --> 01:50:53,979
- Wait a minute. Where are you going?
- To the truck.

1060
01:51:14,712 --> 01:51:16,703
Have another one?

1061
01:51:57,688 --> 01:51:59,588
Come on, Dad.

1062
01:52:25,349 --> 01:52:28,147
This is not a place to bring a fancy woman.

1063
01:52:31,255 --> 01:52:36,022
Would you say? If you had a fancy woman,
would you bring her in a place like this?

1064
01:52:36,127 --> 01:52:38,561
What's a fancy woman?

1065
01:52:55,412 --> 01:52:58,609
Oh! God.

1066
01:52:58,716 --> 01:53:00,877
My mother--

1067
01:53:02,253 --> 01:53:04,153
<i>Not your mother...</i>

1068
01:53:04,255 --> 01:53:06,917
but my mother...

1069
01:53:07,024 --> 01:53:09,584
was not a fancy woman.

1070
01:53:09,693 --> 01:53:12,059
She was --

1071
01:53:17,468 --> 01:53:22,064
She never wanted to be a fancy woman.
She never even pretended to be a fancy woman.

1072
01:53:22,173 --> 01:53:24,903
Then what was she?

1073
01:53:25,009 --> 01:53:27,534
<i>She was just plain.</i>

1074
01:53:29,814 --> 01:53:31,782
Just plain and good.

1075
01:53:31,882 --> 01:53:34,715
<i>She was very good.</i>

1076
01:53:34,819 --> 01:53:36,719
<i>But my daddy--</i>

1077
01:53:39,323 --> 01:53:42,190
See, my daddy had, uh --

1078
01:53:42,293 --> 01:53:44,284
He had this idea --

1079
01:53:44,395 --> 01:53:48,491
he had this idea in his head
that was kind of--

1080
01:53:48,599 --> 01:53:52,399
kind of-- kind of a sickness.

1081
01:53:52,503 --> 01:53:54,403
<i>What idea?</i>

1082
01:53:54,505 --> 01:53:56,939
He had this idea about her...

1083
01:53:57,041 --> 01:53:58,941
<i>and...</i>

1084
01:54:00,444 --> 01:54:03,140
<i>he looked at her...</i>

1085
01:54:03,247 --> 01:54:05,715
but he didn't see her.

1086
01:54:08,252 --> 01:54:11,881
<i>He--He saw this idea.</i>

1087
01:54:15,726 --> 01:54:19,594
And he told people that she was from Paris.

1088
01:54:21,265 --> 01:54:23,995
It was a big joke...

1089
01:54:24,101 --> 01:54:26,001
but he started telling everybody
all the time...

1090
01:54:26,103 --> 01:54:28,071
and finally it wasn't a joke anymore.
He st --

1091
01:54:31,575 --> 01:54:33,702
He started believing it.

1092
01:54:35,179 --> 01:54:38,307
And he actually believed it.

1093
01:54:41,619 --> 01:54:43,644
And she --

1094
01:54:43,754 --> 01:54:46,086
Oh, God.

1095
01:54:46,190 --> 01:54:48,988
She would get so embarrassed.

1096
01:54:50,794 --> 01:54:52,785
She --

1097
01:54:52,897 --> 01:54:55,195
She was so --

1098
01:54:57,401 --> 01:54:59,699
She was so shy.

1099
01:55:48,285 --> 01:55:50,253
<i>Vámonos, muchacho.</i>

1100
01:56:19,116 --> 01:56:21,016
Left, Dad.

1101
01:56:35,699 --> 01:56:37,997
Hunter, it's me.

1102
01:56:41,238 --> 01:56:44,696
I was afraid I'd never be able
to say the right words to you...

1103
01:56:44,808 --> 01:56:47,072
in person...

1104
01:56:47,177 --> 01:56:51,113
so I'm trying to do it like this.

1105
01:56:54,118 --> 01:56:57,178
When I first saw you this time...

1106
01:56:58,255 --> 01:57:00,155
at Walt's...

1107
01:57:01,492 --> 01:57:04,950
I was hoping for all kinds of things.

1108
01:57:06,897 --> 01:57:10,526
I was hoping to show you
that I was your father.

1109
01:57:12,669 --> 01:57:14,796
You showed me I was.

1110
01:57:18,342 --> 01:57:21,311
But the biggest thing I hoped for...

1111
01:57:23,514 --> 01:57:25,482
can't come true.

1112
01:57:27,851 --> 01:57:30,319
I know that now.

1113
01:57:32,022 --> 01:57:34,513
You belong together with your mother.

1114
01:57:36,860 --> 01:57:39,624
<i>You belong together with your mother.</i>

1115
01:57:41,265 --> 01:57:44,428
<i>It was me that tore you apart...</i>

1116
01:57:44,535 --> 01:57:47,993
<i>and I owe it to you to bring you back together.</i>

1117
01:57:49,473 --> 01:57:51,964
But I can't stay with you.

1118
01:57:52,076 --> 01:57:55,637
<i>I could never heal up what happened.</i>

1119
01:57:55,746 --> 01:57:59,182
That's just the way it is.

1120
01:57:59,283 --> 01:58:02,650
I can't even hardly remember what happened.

1121
01:58:02,753 --> 01:58:05,119
It's like a gap.

1122
01:58:05,222 --> 01:58:07,918
But it left me alone in a way that...

1123
01:58:08,025 --> 01:58:10,391
I haven't gotten over.

1124
01:58:10,494 --> 01:58:14,021
And right now, I'm afraid.

1125
01:58:15,766 --> 01:58:18,894
I'm afraid of walking away again.

1126
01:58:19,002 --> 01:58:21,470
I'm afraid of what I might find.

1127
01:58:23,006 --> 01:58:25,668
But I'm even more afraid of...

1128
01:58:25,776 --> 01:58:29,075
not facing this fear.

1129
01:58:29,179 --> 01:58:31,647
I love you, Hunter.

1130
01:58:32,816 --> 01:58:35,546
I love you more than my life.

1131
01:58:46,597 --> 01:58:48,497
Hey.

1132
01:58:48,599 --> 01:58:50,499
Hey.

1133
01:58:55,038 --> 01:58:57,734
Can I tell you something?

1134
01:58:59,309 --> 01:59:02,005
Sure. Anything you like.

1135
01:59:03,547 --> 01:59:05,447
It's kind of long.

1136
01:59:06,550 --> 01:59:08,848
I got plenty of time.

1137
01:59:32,276 --> 01:59:34,642
I knew these people.

1138
01:59:34,745 --> 01:59:36,645
What people?

1139
01:59:37,948 --> 01:59:39,916
These two people.

1140
01:59:45,022 --> 01:59:47,490
They were in love with each other.

1141
01:59:50,027 --> 01:59:52,723
The girl was... very young...

1142
01:59:52,829 --> 01:59:56,458
about 17 or 18, I guess.

1143
01:59:57,935 --> 02:00:01,393
And the guy was... quite a bit older.

1144
02:00:02,973 --> 02:00:06,067
He was kind of raggedy and wild.

1145
02:00:07,211 --> 02:00:09,645
And she was very beautiful, you know?

1146
02:00:11,682 --> 02:00:13,582
Yeah.

1147
02:00:13,684 --> 02:00:17,814
<i>And together they turned everything</i>
<i>into a kind of an adventure...</i>

1148
02:00:19,122 --> 02:00:21,989
<i>and she liked that.</i>

1149
02:00:22,092 --> 02:00:25,892
<i>Just an ordinary trip</i>
<i>down to the grocery store was...</i>

1150
02:00:25,996 --> 02:00:28,988
<i>full of adventure.</i>

1151
02:00:29,099 --> 02:00:32,865
And they were always laughing
at stupid things.

1152
02:00:32,970 --> 02:00:36,064
He liked to make her laugh.

1153
02:00:36,173 --> 02:00:38,141
And...

1154
02:00:39,710 --> 02:00:42,406
<i>they didn't much care for anything else...</i>

1155
02:00:42,512 --> 02:00:46,380
<i>because all they wanted to do</i>
<i>was be with each other.</i>

1156
02:00:48,185 --> 02:00:50,653
<i>They were always together.</i>

1157
02:00:50,754 --> 02:00:53,382
Sounds like they were very happy.

1158
02:00:53,490 --> 02:00:56,288
Yes, they were.

1159
02:00:56,393 --> 02:00:59,191
They were real happy.

1160
02:00:59,296 --> 02:01:02,595
And he -- he loved her more than...

1161
02:01:05,135 --> 02:01:07,262
he ever felt possible.

1162
02:01:10,340 --> 02:01:14,868
He couldn't stand being away from her,
uh, during the day when he went to work.

1163
02:01:20,317 --> 02:01:23,309
<i>So he'd quit...</i>

1164
02:01:23,420 --> 02:01:26,048
<i>just to be home with her.</i>

1165
02:01:26,156 --> 02:01:30,286
<i>Then he'd get another job</i>
<i>when the money ran out...</i>

1166
02:01:30,394 --> 02:01:32,919
<i>and then he'd quit again.</i>

1167
02:01:33,030 --> 02:01:35,828
<i>But pretty soon, she started to worry.</i>

1168
02:01:40,237 --> 02:01:43,035
- About what?
<i>- Money, I guess.</i>

1169
02:01:43,140 --> 02:01:45,040
<i>- Not having enough.</i>
- Mmm.

1170
02:01:45,142 --> 02:01:47,474
<i>Not knowing</i>
<i>when the next check was coming in.</i>

1171
02:01:49,646 --> 02:01:52,444
Yep, I know that feeling.

1172
02:01:52,549 --> 02:01:57,248
<i>So he started to get kind of torn inside.</i>

1173
02:02:00,957 --> 02:02:03,323
How do you mean?

1174
02:02:03,427 --> 02:02:06,487
<i>Well, he knew he had to work to support her...</i>

1175
02:02:06,596 --> 02:02:09,565
<i>but he couldn't stand</i>
<i>being away from her either.</i>

1176
02:02:11,268 --> 02:02:13,168
I see.

1177
02:02:13,270 --> 02:02:16,728
<i>And the more he was away from her,</i>
<i>the crazier he got...</i>

1178
02:02:17,908 --> 02:02:20,877
<i>except now he got really crazy.</i>

1179
02:02:24,348 --> 02:02:26,873
He started imagining all kinds of things.

1180
02:02:28,652 --> 02:02:30,552
Like what?

1181
02:02:32,222 --> 02:02:36,420
He started thinking
that she was seeing other men on the sly.

1182
02:02:37,794 --> 02:02:40,592
He'd come home from work
and accuse her of...

1183
02:02:40,697 --> 02:02:43,165
spending the day with somebody else.

1184
02:02:43,266 --> 02:02:45,962
He'd yell at her and break things in the trailer.

1185
02:02:48,505 --> 02:02:50,405
The trailer.

1186
02:02:55,579 --> 02:02:58,013
Yes.

1187
02:02:58,115 --> 02:03:00,583
They lived in a trailer home.

1188
02:03:15,365 --> 02:03:19,461
Excuse me, sir,
but were you in to visit me the other day?

1189
02:03:19,569 --> 02:03:21,867
I don't mean to pry.

1190
02:03:23,607 --> 02:03:26,167
No.

1191
02:03:26,276 --> 02:03:28,176
Oh.

1192
02:03:29,679 --> 02:03:33,308
I thought I recognized your voice for a minute.

1193
02:03:34,785 --> 02:03:37,754
No. Wasn't me.

1194
02:03:39,189 --> 02:03:41,089
Mm-hmm.

1195
02:03:43,160 --> 02:03:45,128
Please go on.

1196
02:03:47,564 --> 02:03:51,898
Anyway, he started to drink real bad...

1197
02:03:52,002 --> 02:03:55,130
and he'd stay out late to test her.

1198
02:03:56,973 --> 02:03:59,840
What do you mean "test her"?

1199
02:03:59,943 --> 02:04:02,571
To see if she'd get jealous.

1200
02:04:03,613 --> 02:04:06,241
Mm-hmm.

1201
02:04:08,051 --> 02:04:11,851
He wanted her to get jealous, but she didn't.

1202
02:04:11,955 --> 02:04:14,355
She just worried about him...

1203
02:04:14,458 --> 02:04:16,926
but that got him even madder.

1204
02:04:18,195 --> 02:04:20,561
Why?

1205
02:04:20,664 --> 02:04:22,996
Because...

1206
02:04:23,099 --> 02:04:26,500
he thought if she never got jealous of him
that she didn't really care about him.

1207
02:04:28,205 --> 02:04:32,574
<i>Jealousy was a sign of her love for him.</i>

1208
02:04:32,676 --> 02:04:35,110
<i>And then one night--</i>

1209
02:04:35,212 --> 02:04:39,308
<i>one night she told him that she was pregnant.</i>

1210
02:04:39,416 --> 02:04:42,283
<i>She was about three or four months pregnant...</i>

1211
02:04:42,385 --> 02:04:44,615
<i>and he didn't even know.</i>

1212
02:04:44,721 --> 02:04:47,918
<i>And then suddenly everything changed.</i>

1213
02:04:48,024 --> 02:04:51,983
<i>He stopped drinking and got a steady job.</i>

1214
02:04:52,095 --> 02:04:57,032
<i>He was convinced that she loved him now</i>
<i>because she was carrying his child.</i>

1215
02:04:57,133 --> 02:05:01,069
<i>And he was going to dedicate himself</i>
<i>to making a home for her.</i>

1216
02:05:02,272 --> 02:05:04,968
<i>But a funny thing started to happen.</i>

1217
02:05:05,075 --> 02:05:06,667
What?

1218
02:05:06,776 --> 02:05:09,176
<i>He didn't even notice it at first.</i>

1219
02:05:09,279 --> 02:05:11,873
<i>She started to change.</i>

1220
02:05:11,982 --> 02:05:16,885
<i>From the day the baby was born, she began</i>
<i>to get irritated with everything around her.</i>

1221
02:05:16,987 --> 02:05:19,717
<i>She got mad at everything.</i>

1222
02:05:19,823 --> 02:05:23,281
<i>Even the baby seemed to be an injustice to her.</i>

1223
02:05:23,393 --> 02:05:26,362
<i>He kept trying</i>
<i>to make everything all right for her--</i>

1224
02:05:26,463 --> 02:05:30,763
<i>buy her things,</i>
<i>take her out to dinner once a week.</i>

1225
02:05:30,867 --> 02:05:33,597
<i>But nothing seemed to satisfy her.</i>

1226
02:05:33,703 --> 02:05:37,366
<i>For two years,</i>
<i>he struggled to pull them back together...</i>

1227
02:05:37,474 --> 02:05:40,807
<i>like they were when they first met...</i>

1228
02:05:40,911 --> 02:05:45,371
<i>but finally he knew</i>
<i>that it was never gonna work out.</i>

1229
02:05:46,850 --> 02:05:48,943
<i>So he hit the bottle again.</i>

1230
02:05:49,052 --> 02:05:52,078
<i>But this time, it got mean.</i>

1231
02:05:52,188 --> 02:05:54,713
<i>This time, when he came home late at night...</i>

1232
02:05:54,824 --> 02:05:58,123
<i>she wasn't worried about him or jealous.</i>

1233
02:05:58,228 --> 02:06:00,560
<i>She was just enraged.</i>

1234
02:06:02,098 --> 02:06:06,535
<i>She accused him of holding her captive</i>
<i>by making her have a baby.</i>

1235
02:06:08,438 --> 02:06:11,407
<i>She told him that she dreamed about escaping.</i>

1236
02:06:11,508 --> 02:06:15,376
<i>That was all she dreamed about--escape.</i>

1237
02:06:15,478 --> 02:06:19,312
<i>She saw herself at night,</i>
<i>running naked down a highway...</i>

1238
02:06:19,416 --> 02:06:21,509
<i>running across fields...</i>

1239
02:06:21,618 --> 02:06:23,586
<i>running down riverbeds.</i>

1240
02:06:23,687 --> 02:06:25,587
<i>Always running.</i>

1241
02:06:25,689 --> 02:06:29,989
<i>And always, just when she was</i>
<i>about to get away, he'd be there.</i>

1242
02:06:30,093 --> 02:06:33,392
<i>He would stop her somehow.</i>

1243
02:06:33,496 --> 02:06:36,124
<i>He would just appear and stop her.</i>

1244
02:06:39,035 --> 02:06:43,563
<i>And when she told him these dreams,</i>
<i>he believed them.</i>

1245
02:06:43,673 --> 02:06:47,473
<i>He knew she had to be stopped,</i>
<i>or she'd leave him forever.</i>

1246
02:06:47,577 --> 02:06:50,239
<i>So he tied a cowbell to her ankle...</i>

1247
02:06:50,347 --> 02:06:54,306
<i>so he could hear at night</i>
<i>if she tried to get out of bed.</i>

1248
02:06:54,417 --> 02:06:58,285
<i>But she learned how to muffle the bell</i>
<i>by stuffing a sock into it...</i>

1249
02:06:58,388 --> 02:07:01,380
<i>and inching her way out of the bed...</i>

1250
02:07:01,491 --> 02:07:03,391
<i>and into the night.</i>

1251
02:07:04,628 --> 02:07:06,493
<i>He caught her one night</i>
<i>when the sock fell out...</i>

1252
02:07:06,596 --> 02:07:09,121
<i>and he heard her trying to run to the highway.</i>

1253
02:07:09,232 --> 02:07:11,860
<i>He caught her,</i>
<i>dragged her back to the trailer...</i>

1254
02:07:11,968 --> 02:07:14,994
<i>and tied her to the stove with his belt.</i>

1255
02:07:16,873 --> 02:07:21,503
<i>He just left her there and went back to bed...</i>

1256
02:07:21,611 --> 02:07:25,479
<i>and lay there, listening to her scream.</i>

1257
02:07:25,582 --> 02:07:29,814
<i>Then he listened to his son scream.</i>

1258
02:07:29,919 --> 02:07:32,387
<i>He was surprised at himself because...</i>

1259
02:07:32,489 --> 02:07:35,287
<i>he didn't feel anything anymore.</i>

1260
02:07:36,926 --> 02:07:39,895
<i>All he wanted to do was sleep.</i>

1261
02:07:41,831 --> 02:07:44,026
And for the first time...

1262
02:07:44,134 --> 02:07:46,898
he wished he were far away...

1263
02:07:50,040 --> 02:07:54,841
lost in a deep, vast country
where nobody knew him...

1264
02:07:54,944 --> 02:07:57,572
somewhere without language...

1265
02:07:57,681 --> 02:08:00,377
or streets.

1266
02:08:00,483 --> 02:08:04,442
And he dreamed about this place
without knowing its name.

1267
02:08:04,554 --> 02:08:07,887
And when he woke up, he was on fire.

1268
02:08:10,894 --> 02:08:14,853
There were blue flames
burning the sheets of his bed.

1269
02:08:14,964 --> 02:08:17,626
He ran through the flames...

1270
02:08:17,734 --> 02:08:21,226
toward the only two people he loved...

1271
02:08:21,337 --> 02:08:23,237
but they were gone.

1272
02:08:25,909 --> 02:08:29,868
<i>His arms were burning,</i>
<i>and he threw himself outside and--</i>

1273
02:08:31,614 --> 02:08:34,242
<i>and rolled on the wet ground.</i>

1274
02:08:36,519 --> 02:08:38,487
Then he ran.

1275
02:08:39,756 --> 02:08:42,224
He never looked back at the fire.

1276
02:08:44,794 --> 02:08:46,955
He just ran.

1277
02:08:52,869 --> 02:08:55,497
<i>He ran until the sun came up...</i>

1278
02:08:56,740 --> 02:08:59,834
<i>and he couldn't run any further.</i>

1279
02:09:01,044 --> 02:09:03,512
<i>Then when the sun went down...</i>

1280
02:09:03,613 --> 02:09:05,581
<i>he ran again.</i>

1281
02:09:11,488 --> 02:09:15,390
<i>For five days, he ran like this...</i>

1282
02:09:15,492 --> 02:09:18,325
<i>until every sign of man...</i>

1283
02:09:21,097 --> 02:09:23,065
<i>had disappeared.</i>

1284
02:09:34,177 --> 02:09:36,077
Travis.

1285
02:10:18,655 --> 02:10:21,886
If you turn the light off in there,
will you be able to see me?

1286
02:10:30,333 --> 02:10:32,301
I don't know.

1287
02:10:36,840 --> 02:10:38,808
I never tried.

1288
02:10:57,627 --> 02:10:59,754
Can you see me?

1289
02:11:01,297 --> 02:11:03,993
Yeah.

1290
02:11:04,100 --> 02:11:06,227
Do you recognize me?

1291
02:11:08,338 --> 02:11:10,238
Oh, Travis.

1292
02:11:17,714 --> 02:11:20,182
I brought Hunter with me.

1293
02:11:32,328 --> 02:11:34,626
Don't you want to see him?

1294
02:11:36,733 --> 02:11:38,633
Yeah.

1295
02:11:47,310 --> 02:11:51,804
I wanted to see him so bad
that I didn't even dare imagine him anymore.

1296
02:11:57,954 --> 02:12:00,752
Anne kept sendin' me pictures of him...

1297
02:12:03,760 --> 02:12:06,228
until I asked her to stop.

1298
02:12:12,468 --> 02:12:15,494
I couldn't stand the... pain...

1299
02:12:15,605 --> 02:12:18,574
of seeing him grow up and missin' it.

1300
02:12:27,483 --> 02:12:30,452
Why didn't you keep him with you, Jane?

1301
02:12:33,623 --> 02:12:35,591
I couldn't, Travis.

1302
02:12:39,762 --> 02:12:42,731
I didn't have what I knew he needed.

1303
02:12:49,405 --> 02:12:53,034
I didn't want to use him
to fill all my emptiness.

1304
02:12:58,448 --> 02:13:00,746
Well, he needs you now, Jane...

1305
02:13:00,850 --> 02:13:02,818
and he wants to see you.

1306
02:13:02,919 --> 02:13:04,887
He does?

1307
02:13:07,357 --> 02:13:09,257
Yes.

1308
02:13:13,429 --> 02:13:15,897
He's -- He's waiting for you.

1309
02:13:15,999 --> 02:13:17,899
Where?

1310
02:13:20,436 --> 02:13:22,904
Downtown...

1311
02:13:23,006 --> 02:13:24,974
in a hotel.

1312
02:13:26,876 --> 02:13:28,776
The Meridian.

1313
02:13:30,780 --> 02:13:32,680
Room 1520.

1314
02:13:37,620 --> 02:13:39,520
1520.

1315
02:13:40,656 --> 02:13:43,454
You're not going, are you?

1316
02:13:58,174 --> 02:14:00,642
I can't see you, Jane.

1317
02:14:02,545 --> 02:14:04,513
Don't go yet.

1318
02:14:08,885 --> 02:14:10,853
Don't go yet.

1319
02:14:29,138 --> 02:14:31,038
I --

1320
02:14:33,309 --> 02:14:36,938
I used to make up long speeches to you
after you left.

1321
02:14:42,018 --> 02:14:44,680
I used to talk to you all the time...

1322
02:14:44,787 --> 02:14:47,085
even though I was alone.

1323
02:14:50,460 --> 02:14:53,918
I walked around for months talking to you.

1324
02:14:58,034 --> 02:15:00,502
Now I don't know what to say.

1325
02:15:05,108 --> 02:15:08,077
It was easier when I just imagined you.

1326
02:15:16,018 --> 02:15:18,987
I even imagined you talking back to me.

1327
02:15:23,626 --> 02:15:26,527
We'd have long conversations...

1328
02:15:28,097 --> 02:15:30,065
the two of us.

1329
02:15:33,736 --> 02:15:36,204
It was almost like you were there.

1330
02:15:40,543 --> 02:15:42,511
I could hear you.

1331
02:15:42,612 --> 02:15:44,580
I could see you, smell you.

1332
02:15:46,682 --> 02:15:48,650
I could hear your voice.

1333
02:15:51,721 --> 02:15:54,349
Sometimes your voice would wake me up.

1334
02:15:57,226 --> 02:15:59,194
It would wake me up in the middle of the night...

1335
02:15:59,295 --> 02:16:01,525
just like you were there in the room with me.

1336
02:16:10,072 --> 02:16:11,972
Then...

1337
02:16:14,844 --> 02:16:16,812
it slowly faded.

1338
02:16:18,948 --> 02:16:21,416
I couldn't picture you anymore.

1339
02:16:25,054 --> 02:16:28,285
I tried to talk out loud to you like I used to...

1340
02:16:28,391 --> 02:16:30,859
but there was nothin' there.

1341
02:16:34,297 --> 02:16:36,629
I couldn't hear you.

1342
02:16:41,938 --> 02:16:43,838
Then...

1343
02:16:48,711 --> 02:16:50,679
I just gave up.

1344
02:16:57,153 --> 02:16:59,280
Everything stopped.

1345
02:17:01,090 --> 02:17:02,990
You...

1346
02:17:06,796 --> 02:17:08,923
just disappeared.

1347
02:17:15,104 --> 02:17:17,334
Now I'm working here.

1348
02:17:22,912 --> 02:17:25,710
I hear your voice all the time.

1349
02:17:30,052 --> 02:17:33,954
Every man...

1350
02:17:34,056 --> 02:17:36,251
has your voice.

1351
02:17:54,977 --> 02:17:58,435
I'll tell Hunter... that you're coming.

1352
02:18:03,419 --> 02:18:05,944
- Travis?
- What?

1353
02:18:09,792 --> 02:18:11,760
I'll be there.

1354
02:18:16,465 --> 02:18:18,365
Good.

1355
02:18:23,339 --> 02:18:25,239
Meridian Hotel.

1356
02:18:25,341 --> 02:18:27,241
Yeah.

1357
02:18:30,846 --> 02:18:34,543
Room 1520.

1358
02:19:43,419 --> 02:19:46,183
<i>Yeah!</i>

1359
02:19:46,288 --> 02:19:49,018
<i>"Why, you little"--</i>

1360
02:19:49,125 --> 02:19:52,117
<i>Yeah!</i>

1361
02:19:52,228 --> 02:19:56,028
<i>Yeah.</i>

1362
02:21:23,986 --> 02:21:26,477
Your hair, it's wet.

1363
02:21:35,564 --> 02:21:37,759
Oh!
