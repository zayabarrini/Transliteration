1
00:01:02,331 --> 00:01:05,266
I'm going out on a date!

2
00:01:05,668 --> 00:01:08,536
You're going to have no fun!

3
00:01:08,872 --> 00:01:11,864
It's Sunday but you're stuck here!

4
00:01:13,144 --> 00:01:16,704
No date for you! You're out of luck!

5
00:01:48,213 --> 00:01:49,145
Quiet!

6
00:03:22,213 --> 00:03:23,442
What's so funny?

7
00:03:53,246 --> 00:03:59,310
Blue crab soup, broiled eels, fried
octopus, fried rice...

8
00:03:59,552 --> 00:04:05,982
Marinated beef, shabu-shabu,
shark's fin soup...

9
00:04:13,968 --> 00:04:15,162
Welcome!

10
00:04:26,814 --> 00:04:28,715
Sorry, we're closing

11
00:04:29,284 --> 00:04:29,807
Excuse me?

12
00:04:30,052 --> 00:04:31,417
Lunch is over

13
00:04:32,054 --> 00:04:33,419
You're closing?

14
00:04:34,290 --> 00:04:35,551
Please try somewhere else

15
00:04:35,724 --> 00:04:37,625
What about these people?

16
00:04:37,694 --> 00:04:41,528
We just finished serving lunch,
we can't take any more orders

17
00:04:44,867 --> 00:04:46,495
Let's just go

18
00:04:48,971 --> 00:04:53,375
It's an NBA game...
Michael Jordan!

19
00:04:53,476 --> 00:04:55,468
Please try somewhere else,
I'm sorry

20
00:04:59,049 --> 00:05:01,244
Hey, I'm watching that!

21
00:05:04,288 --> 00:05:05,756
What?

22
00:05:15,500 --> 00:05:16,761
Enjoy your meal!

23
00:05:18,770 --> 00:05:19,429
Come on

24
00:05:21,906 --> 00:05:22,964
Let's go

25
00:05:47,533 --> 00:05:48,091
Come in

26
00:05:50,404 --> 00:05:52,395
What're you doing there in the cold?

27
00:06:03,819 --> 00:06:04,842
What do you want to eat?

28
00:06:05,687 --> 00:06:06,746
Anything

29
00:06:07,389 --> 00:06:08,287
Anything?

30
00:06:13,595 --> 00:06:14,561
I'll have... Jajang noodles

31
00:06:15,029 --> 00:06:17,590
Jajang noodles? Sounds great!

32
00:06:22,505 --> 00:06:23,436
Want to watch TV?

33
00:06:38,221 --> 00:06:40,486
Hi, this is Mangwon auto shop

34
00:06:40,857 --> 00:06:43,121
Two orders of Jajang noodles,
one of fried dumplings...

35
00:06:43,694 --> 00:06:46,355
One mixed seafood, a bottle of
Gaoliang, and make it fast!

36
00:06:57,976 --> 00:07:02,106
Hello, Mangwon auto shop...
Oh hi, sister-in-law

37
00:07:03,347 --> 00:07:10,083
No, he isn't here, it's Sunday

38
00:07:11,724 --> 00:07:14,454
Who knows where he went?

39
00:07:16,195 --> 00:07:18,993
You should keep a better eye on him

40
00:07:19,499 --> 00:07:21,797
Something's fishy about him lately

41
00:07:30,543 --> 00:07:35,811
The money? Oh, that ...

42
00:07:39,386 --> 00:07:42,015
That's what I was trying to tell you

43
00:07:45,360 --> 00:07:46,554
That hurt!

44
00:07:49,397 --> 00:07:53,424
Yeah, but I didn't want to wake you

45
00:07:54,537 --> 00:07:55,867
Of course I know what I did!

46
00:07:58,573 --> 00:08:00,667
That's so upsetting

47
00:08:00,810 --> 00:08:02,538
''That's so upsetting''

48
00:08:02,644 --> 00:08:04,237
If you say that, I feel bad

49
00:08:04,346 --> 00:08:06,279
''If you say that, I feel bad''

50
00:08:07,950 --> 00:08:10,885
What? That's not what I meant...

51
00:08:13,490 --> 00:08:18,189
Fuck! Now it's cut off!

52
00:08:25,235 --> 00:08:27,226
Why are you angry with me?

53
00:08:28,104 --> 00:08:29,366
What did I do?

54
00:08:30,373 --> 00:08:31,466
You got angry with me!

55
00:08:36,214 --> 00:08:37,841
How dare you?

56
00:08:40,719 --> 00:08:42,743
What's upset you all of a sudden?

57
00:08:46,925 --> 00:08:48,551
Why are you like this?

58
00:09:06,145 --> 00:09:07,737
The Jajang noodles are here

59
00:09:14,555 --> 00:09:17,421
I'll tell you about the dream
I had last night

60
00:09:18,691 --> 00:09:32,504
I was in your room,
dancing with Your Highness

61
00:09:33,608 --> 00:09:37,635
But we weren't alone

62
00:09:38,914 --> 00:09:46,650
An Indian woman, a kid and an elephant
...the ones from the oasis

63
00:09:51,694 --> 00:10:00,625
You know,
that Oasis picture on your wall

64
00:10:10,047 --> 00:10:11,513
I know it was only a dream...

65
00:10:14,117 --> 00:10:15,777
But it seemed so real

66
00:10:37,977 --> 00:10:40,604
What the fuck is all this traffic?

67
00:10:59,265 --> 00:11:02,131
Shit, this feels great!

68
00:11:11,846 --> 00:11:13,837
Step out, Your Highness!

69
00:11:14,514 --> 00:11:18,247
It's alright, you can get out

70
00:11:25,127 --> 00:11:26,287
Isn't this great?

71
00:11:26,728 --> 00:11:30,789
We're on the expressway,
Your Highness

72
00:11:32,199 --> 00:11:34,862
When would we get to stand
in the middle of an expressway?

73
00:12:34,333 --> 00:12:36,528
You have a go too, Your Highness

74
00:13:37,634 --> 00:13:38,862
Isn't this great?

75
00:15:17,940 --> 00:15:19,465
Aw, fuck...

76
00:15:34,791 --> 00:15:35,689
Out of the car!

77
00:15:36,860 --> 00:15:38,226
Now, you bastard!

78
00:15:43,233 --> 00:15:45,225
How could you take out
a customer's car?

79
00:15:47,405 --> 00:15:48,337
I'm very sorry

80
00:15:48,839 --> 00:15:50,205
Everything has been repaired

81
00:15:51,343 --> 00:15:54,107
The car's running fine

82
00:15:54,479 --> 00:15:55,776
I took it out for a test drive,
and there's no problem

83
00:15:55,881 --> 00:15:57,541
That's not the issue

84
00:15:57,648 --> 00:16:00,015
Do you know how long
I've been waiting here?

85
00:16:00,519 --> 00:16:01,507
I'm terribly sorry

86
00:16:13,499 --> 00:16:17,527
How should I know he was
picking it up on a Sunday?

87
00:16:19,839 --> 00:16:20,397
Come inside

88
00:16:26,680 --> 00:16:27,839
Do you have a driver's license?

89
00:16:29,315 --> 00:16:31,113
Well, do you or not?

90
00:16:32,186 --> 00:16:35,485
You know that it was
revoked after the accident

91
00:16:36,324 --> 00:16:38,884
So you went driving without a license
in a customer's car?

92
00:16:41,862 --> 00:16:46,425
Haven't I told you to grow up,
and behave like an adult?

93
00:16:47,602 --> 00:16:50,502
How many times have I told you
to be responsible for your actions?

94
00:16:53,108 --> 00:16:53,938
Bend over

95
00:16:55,677 --> 00:16:56,644
I said, bend over

96
00:17:12,762 --> 00:17:13,457
Start counting

97
00:17:50,269 --> 00:17:53,432
Why... won't you tell me?

98
00:17:54,740 --> 00:17:56,231
You'll see when we get there

99
00:17:56,810 --> 00:18:02,042
Anyway, it's a nice place
so you should look pretty

100
00:18:04,417 --> 00:18:06,578
I'm already pretty now

101
00:18:13,860 --> 00:18:17,057
Welcome! Which party are you with?

102
00:18:17,731 --> 00:18:18,959
Mrs. Hong's

103
00:18:19,166 --> 00:18:20,359
Just a moment, please

104
00:18:27,943 --> 00:18:31,003
Right at the end there

105
00:18:31,246 --> 00:18:32,713
Have a nice time

106
00:18:32,781 --> 00:18:33,645
Thank you

107
00:18:53,536 --> 00:18:55,528
I think I'm the last to arrive

108
00:19:09,652 --> 00:19:13,249
Long time no see, Jong-Du!
You're late!

109
00:19:14,191 --> 00:19:15,681
Hi, uncle!

110
00:19:16,327 --> 00:19:18,624
Happy birthday, Ma!

111
00:19:19,731 --> 00:19:21,824
Don't call me your Ma!
I don't know you!

112
00:19:23,501 --> 00:19:24,866
Who's this you've brought?

113
00:19:29,674 --> 00:19:32,905
Let me introduce her...
This is Miss Han Gong-Ju

114
00:19:33,545 --> 00:19:34,843
She's my friend

115
00:19:36,514 --> 00:19:37,640
What kind of friend is she?

116
00:19:38,150 --> 00:19:38,775
Sorry?

117
00:19:39,985 --> 00:19:41,953
What kind of friend
have you brought here?

118
00:19:43,022 --> 00:19:44,217
Just a friend...

119
00:19:44,691 --> 00:19:45,782
Since it's Ma's
birthday and everything...

120
00:19:45,858 --> 00:19:47,417
I thought it'd be nice
to bring her along

121
00:19:49,929 --> 00:19:51,591
That's nice!

122
00:19:51,865 --> 00:19:55,356
Please enjoy the dinner,
while you are here

123
00:19:55,868 --> 00:19:58,769
This is for members of the family only

124
00:19:59,606 --> 00:20:01,574
You can't just bring someone
without asking!

125
00:20:03,009 --> 00:20:04,169
Why not?

126
00:20:04,611 --> 00:20:06,944
Anyhow, you should know her too

127
00:20:07,547 --> 00:20:09,038
Who is she?

128
00:20:09,850 --> 00:20:12,410
Remember the sanitation worker?

129
00:20:12,486 --> 00:20:14,351
The man who died in the accident?

130
00:20:14,655 --> 00:20:15,554
The car accident?

131
00:20:16,924 --> 00:20:20,917
Uncle, I went to prison
because of that accident

132
00:20:21,228 --> 00:20:21,990
And?

133
00:20:22,697 --> 00:20:24,028
She's his daughter

134
00:20:25,967 --> 00:20:27,025
Let's step outside

135
00:20:27,836 --> 00:20:28,894
Why?

136
00:20:29,837 --> 00:20:30,896
I want to talk to you

137
00:20:31,907 --> 00:20:33,101
Let's eat first and talk later

138
00:20:33,175 --> 00:20:34,165
Now!

139
00:21:00,070 --> 00:21:01,901
You're driving me crazy,
you know that?

140
00:21:03,974 --> 00:21:05,033
How did you meet that girl?

141
00:21:06,076 --> 00:21:07,339
I went to her house

142
00:21:08,213 --> 00:21:09,271
Why did you go there?

143
00:21:09,748 --> 00:21:11,340
Because I felt guilty

144
00:21:12,651 --> 00:21:13,914
Why did you feel guilty?

145
00:21:14,818 --> 00:21:18,550
If anyone should feel guilty,
it should be me!

146
00:21:18,990 --> 00:21:20,389
Jong-Il, let me talk to him

147
00:21:22,127 --> 00:21:25,494
Jong-Du, look at me, will you?

148
00:21:26,832 --> 00:21:29,323
You've got it in for me, right?

149
00:21:30,436 --> 00:21:31,698
You blame me, don't you?

150
00:21:33,205 --> 00:21:34,934
Why would I blame you?

151
00:21:35,007 --> 00:21:38,239
Why else would you go to her house
and bring her here?

152
00:21:39,046 --> 00:21:41,378
Let me talk to him
You go back inside, Jong-Il

153
00:21:43,115 --> 00:21:45,778
Listen to me carefully

154
00:21:46,385 --> 00:21:50,982
No one forced you to go to prison

155
00:21:51,858 --> 00:21:53,485
You volunteered, didn't you?

156
00:21:54,829 --> 00:21:58,265
After Jong-Il ran over that guy,
you were to first to say it

157
00:21:58,800 --> 00:22:03,670
That he had a family to feed
and a future, so you'd go in for him

158
00:22:05,173 --> 00:22:08,869
You also said you had
prior convictions, had no job

159
00:22:09,343 --> 00:22:10,640
and knew the way to jail

160
00:22:11,112 --> 00:22:12,239
Isn't that what you said?

161
00:22:12,980 --> 00:22:15,245
You have a good memory, don't you,
you bastard!

162
00:22:16,385 --> 00:22:18,546
So you shouldn't act this way

163
00:22:18,687 --> 00:22:20,314
What have I done wrong?

164
00:22:22,658 --> 00:22:23,647
Tell me the truth, Jong-Du

165
00:22:24,126 --> 00:22:25,355
What exactly is in your mind?

166
00:22:26,462 --> 00:22:27,326
What do you mean?

167
00:22:27,630 --> 00:22:29,757
Why did you bring her here?

168
00:22:30,233 --> 00:22:32,793
Please take her back home

169
00:22:34,205 --> 00:22:34,829
Why?

170
00:22:35,204 --> 00:22:38,936
Isn't it obvious?
You shouldn't be doing this!

171
00:22:39,175 --> 00:22:41,075
But I'm hungry!

172
00:22:41,478 --> 00:22:42,638
Is that important now?

173
00:22:43,180 --> 00:22:44,510
Gong-Ju has to eat, too

174
00:22:44,647 --> 00:22:46,946
She's our guest!
We can't just tell her to go!

175
00:22:47,418 --> 00:22:49,477
Fuck, why did you pull
a stunt like this?

176
00:22:49,920 --> 00:22:51,217
Think before you do something!

177
00:22:51,689 --> 00:22:54,852
I don't know what you mean

178
00:22:55,694 --> 00:22:57,286
Jong-Du, come back here!
We haven't finished talking!

179
00:22:57,395 --> 00:22:58,224
Jong-Du!

180
00:23:05,303 --> 00:23:10,673
Remember, there were loads of
greenfinches behind our house

181
00:23:11,010 --> 00:23:12,909
I used to think they were sparrows

182
00:23:13,145 --> 00:23:14,738
But Dad told me
they were greenfinches

183
00:23:16,047 --> 00:23:24,683
And that they had little bells
under their necks

184
00:23:27,727 --> 00:23:30,696
So I used to stand
under the big tree forever...

185
00:23:31,798 --> 00:23:36,736
...to look for the bells on their necks

186
00:23:36,970 --> 00:23:46,004
I thought it was true they had bells

187
00:23:50,151 --> 00:23:52,346
Why are you telling this story now?

188
00:23:54,155 --> 00:23:56,554
Tell me! Why this story?

189
00:23:57,692 --> 00:24:02,595
It just came into my mind...

190
00:24:03,933 --> 00:24:06,299
Why would that story
come into your mind right now?

191
00:24:11,774 --> 00:24:13,901
I don't know, it just did

192
00:24:17,714 --> 00:24:19,909
I wish I could understand
what goes on in your head

193
00:24:20,283 --> 00:24:24,412
Tell me, what made you think of
those sparrows?

194
00:24:25,789 --> 00:24:28,280
He said they were greenfinches,
not sparrows

195
00:24:53,385 --> 00:24:55,318
Hey, this photo is family only!

196
00:24:55,821 --> 00:24:57,345
We should all be in it
for the family album

197
00:24:59,057 --> 00:25:00,786
You should look your best

198
00:25:01,326 --> 00:25:02,692
Not with her, you idiot!

199
00:25:03,462 --> 00:25:04,156
Pardon?

200
00:25:13,506 --> 00:25:15,201
Fuck, then I won't be in it either!

201
00:25:18,177 --> 00:25:20,976
Jong-Du, where are you going?

202
00:25:21,981 --> 00:25:23,039
Jong-Du!

203
00:25:23,417 --> 00:25:24,213
Let him go

204
00:25:25,685 --> 00:25:27,586
So are we taking a picture or not?

205
00:25:27,688 --> 00:25:28,746
Just go ahead

206
00:25:31,859 --> 00:25:35,921
Here we go

207
00:25:36,164 --> 00:25:41,032
Everybody look this way... Fine!

208
00:25:41,101 --> 00:25:42,865
One, two, three!

209
00:25:45,173 --> 00:25:50,543
Fuck, it's cold as hell, isn't it?

210
00:25:55,484 --> 00:26:00,752
Want to go to karaoke?
How about that?

211
00:26:02,758 --> 00:26:06,319
Your Highness, my princess,
please don't be angry

212
00:26:08,998 --> 00:26:10,590
What's wrong?

213
00:26:11,767 --> 00:26:13,633
I'm sorry, it was my fault

214
00:26:14,071 --> 00:26:17,199
Your Highness,
I beg for your forgiveness

215
00:26:17,307 --> 00:26:18,399
My princess, let's just go home

216
00:26:23,981 --> 00:26:26,382
What do you want?
You don't want to go home?

217
00:26:29,220 --> 00:26:33,589
Fuck! Do you want to
stay here all night?

218
00:26:35,727 --> 00:26:38,423
Do whatever you like, I'm going

219
00:27:08,595 --> 00:27:15,434
''As I stumbled through
the dark labyrinth of my past...''

220
00:27:15,603 --> 00:27:21,770
''...I didn't know
the meaning of existence''

221
00:27:21,877 --> 00:27:28,839
''Now I know,
the reason I exist is you''

222
00:27:29,016 --> 00:27:37,789
''I'd do anything for you...''

223
00:27:37,959 --> 00:27:40,223
''I'd even reach up
and touch the sky''

224
00:27:43,433 --> 00:27:45,093
Thank you very much!

225
00:27:48,037 --> 00:27:53,771
Now, Princess Han
will do the next song

226
00:27:58,014 --> 00:27:59,311
Sing it

227
00:28:12,062 --> 00:28:15,499
Go ahead and try

228
00:30:04,950 --> 00:30:10,080
''If I were the sky...''

229
00:30:11,823 --> 00:30:16,760
''I'd want to be
colored into your face''

230
00:30:18,763 --> 00:30:25,726
''Like the sky tinged red
by the setting sun...''

231
00:30:26,372 --> 00:30:32,141
''I'd want to be
colored on your cheeks''

232
00:30:33,146 --> 00:30:38,311
''If I were a poet...''

233
00:30:39,585 --> 00:30:44,523
''I would sing for you''

234
00:30:46,293 --> 00:30:53,826
''Like a child resting in
its mother's bosom''

235
00:30:55,370 --> 00:31:01,434
''I want to sing happily''

236
00:31:03,544 --> 00:31:10,417
''I want to become
whatever there is...''

237
00:31:11,319 --> 00:31:16,883
''Just for you''

238
00:31:18,895 --> 00:31:26,199
''Do you have any idea, my love...''

239
00:31:26,969 --> 00:31:32,374
''How great a joy this is?''

240
00:31:33,375 --> 00:31:43,275
''Just to be together like today''

241
00:31:43,721 --> 00:31:48,181
''Do you know
what's in my heart?''

242
00:32:11,984 --> 00:32:14,316
Fuck, where's the light switch?

243
00:32:22,561 --> 00:32:23,824
Here, I'll help with your coat

244
00:32:43,251 --> 00:32:45,583
Better go before
the bus stops running...

245
00:32:51,192 --> 00:32:52,682
Want to see a magic trick?

246
00:33:00,536 --> 00:33:02,594
See ya' ! Goodnight!

247
00:33:04,507 --> 00:33:05,337
What's wrong?

248
00:33:07,476 --> 00:33:08,875
Don't go

249
00:33:10,180 --> 00:33:11,340
You want me to stay?

250
00:33:13,516 --> 00:33:16,576
I want to sleep with you

251
00:33:18,220 --> 00:33:23,386
Sleep with me?
What are you talking about?

252
00:33:26,163 --> 00:33:27,152
Don't you know...

253
00:33:28,299 --> 00:33:29,288
''Don't you know...''

254
00:33:29,933 --> 00:33:33,131
...what a woman means...
when she says ...

255
00:33:34,004 --> 00:33:35,802
''...what a woman means ...
when she says''

256
00:33:37,876 --> 00:33:41,140
I want to sleep with you?

257
00:33:41,846 --> 00:33:43,643
''I want to sleep with you''

258
00:33:50,289 --> 00:33:56,558
You said I was quite pretty...

259
00:35:21,319 --> 00:35:22,843
It's not there?

260
00:35:40,038 --> 00:35:40,903
Is that okay?

261
00:35:42,408 --> 00:35:43,774
Is that okay?

262
00:36:22,550 --> 00:36:23,448
Stop!

263
00:36:29,958 --> 00:36:31,425
Maybe she's asleep?
The lights aren't on

264
00:36:31,526 --> 00:36:33,085
It's rather late

265
00:36:35,530 --> 00:36:36,725
Oh, the cake!

266
00:36:55,486 --> 00:36:58,148
What's wrong? Does it hurt?

267
00:37:01,892 --> 00:37:03,325
Want me to stop?

268
00:37:15,839 --> 00:37:17,068
Maybe she's asleep

269
00:37:17,509 --> 00:37:20,535
Yes, the radio isn't on either

270
00:37:21,012 --> 00:37:26,144
And she always has the radio on...
Look at this mess!

271
00:37:27,085 --> 00:37:28,347
Gong-Ju, are you asleep?

272
00:37:34,961 --> 00:37:36,154
Gong-Ju?

273
00:37:41,200 --> 00:37:45,694
Oh, My god! Come here! Quick!

274
00:37:45,805 --> 00:37:48,775
Who the hell are you?
What are you doing to her?

275
00:37:48,975 --> 00:37:50,602
Get the neighbors! Quick!

276
00:37:51,812 --> 00:37:57,217
Get out!
Get the hell away from her!

277
00:37:57,785 --> 00:38:00,549
Come out! Quick! There's a fire!

278
00:38:04,759 --> 00:38:09,560
There's a fire! We need help!

279
00:38:09,630 --> 00:38:10,654
What's going on?

280
00:38:10,932 --> 00:38:12,399
Hurry and go inside!

281
00:38:12,500 --> 00:38:13,558
What's going on?

282
00:38:14,837 --> 00:38:21,299
Poor Gong-Ju, save her!

283
00:38:21,443 --> 00:38:22,910
Shut up for a moment!

284
00:38:23,178 --> 00:38:24,042
Get a move on!

285
00:38:25,748 --> 00:38:26,874
Come out of that room!

286
00:38:29,686 --> 00:38:31,278
Get away from her!

287
00:38:33,656 --> 00:38:35,020
Get away from her!

288
00:38:37,260 --> 00:38:38,192
Get the hell away from her!

289
00:38:40,263 --> 00:38:41,491
Get a move on!
Get the hell out of there!

290
00:38:56,381 --> 00:38:59,111
Should we come too?

291
00:38:59,384 --> 00:39:02,819
Of course, and the victim too

292
00:39:02,920 --> 00:39:04,286
She's very disturbed right now

293
00:39:04,923 --> 00:39:07,756
As you can see, she's disabled,
and it's hard for her to speak, too

294
00:39:07,959 --> 00:39:09,358
Still, we need her to be there

295
00:39:10,027 --> 00:39:11,928
She'll have to be examined

296
00:39:14,100 --> 00:39:15,225
Then we'll follow you in my car

297
00:39:15,400 --> 00:39:16,526
That'll be fine

298
00:39:26,712 --> 00:39:27,973
You have previous convictions, right?

299
00:39:28,613 --> 00:39:29,308
Yes

300
00:39:29,549 --> 00:39:30,641
How many?

301
00:39:31,751 --> 00:39:33,218
Three

302
00:39:34,654 --> 00:39:35,679
What for?

303
00:39:37,190 --> 00:39:40,558
A hit-and-run while driving drunk...

304
00:39:42,029 --> 00:39:43,394
A physical assault...

305
00:39:44,164 --> 00:39:45,063
And?

306
00:39:47,468 --> 00:39:48,799
Attempted rape

307
00:39:52,040 --> 00:39:53,632
I bet you're a pervert, too

308
00:39:56,109 --> 00:39:59,273
Spit it out, are you a pervert?

309
00:40:11,093 --> 00:40:11,889
Who are you here to see?

310
00:40:11,961 --> 00:40:13,485
We're Hong Jong-Du's relatives

311
00:40:13,562 --> 00:40:15,360
I see... please wait over there

312
00:40:34,785 --> 00:40:35,808
Jong-Il! You're here!

313
00:40:36,353 --> 00:40:38,413
Why are you here?
You didn't have to come...

314
00:40:38,956 --> 00:40:41,550
What's your relationship
with this man?

315
00:40:42,159 --> 00:40:46,119
He's my elder brother,
and he's my younger brother

316
00:40:46,364 --> 00:40:49,561
This man is under arrest
for an attempted rape

317
00:40:49,901 --> 00:40:51,562
We spoke on the phone, right?

318
00:40:52,304 --> 00:40:53,066
That's right

319
00:40:53,170 --> 00:40:55,104
The victim is over there

320
00:40:55,774 --> 00:40:59,107
Her family wants to talk to you,
that's why I called you

321
00:40:59,611 --> 00:41:02,546
The case is open-and-shut,
he was caught in the act

322
00:41:03,015 --> 00:41:08,079
But how could he assault
a poor girl like her?

323
00:41:09,489 --> 00:41:11,457
I simply don't get it

324
00:41:12,125 --> 00:41:15,424
Looking at her turns you on?

325
00:41:18,798 --> 00:41:21,096
How come we always meet
in a police station?

326
00:41:22,235 --> 00:41:23,100
You bastard!

327
00:41:23,437 --> 00:41:25,996
Can you even call yourself human?

328
00:41:26,105 --> 00:41:28,199
You're an animal! A beast!

329
00:41:28,309 --> 00:41:30,436
Hey, calm down

330
00:41:33,348 --> 00:41:34,678
Let me see

331
00:41:36,184 --> 00:41:41,280
Let's meet some place better
next time, okay?

332
00:41:42,157 --> 00:41:43,953
Can I have a word with you?

333
00:41:57,707 --> 00:41:59,072
To be frank...

334
00:41:59,875 --> 00:42:02,207
He's my brother,
but I've never really understood him

335
00:42:03,947 --> 00:42:05,208
As my youngest brother knows

336
00:42:06,282 --> 00:42:09,115
We've done everything
to turn him into a real person

337
00:42:10,586 --> 00:42:12,213
But this time he's
gone beyond forgiveness

338
00:42:12,456 --> 00:42:14,252
How do you think I feel?

339
00:42:14,623 --> 00:42:17,092
I understand, of course

340
00:42:19,096 --> 00:42:21,326
We must have very bad karma
from a past life

341
00:42:21,665 --> 00:42:23,656
First our father, and now my sisters

342
00:42:25,870 --> 00:42:29,567
I've been thinking a lot, and...

343
00:42:31,043 --> 00:42:32,737
What's on your mind?

344
00:42:35,279 --> 00:42:36,677
The police said that...

345
00:42:37,915 --> 00:42:46,345
Prosecuting him in court
won't comfort or compensate her

346
00:42:47,926 --> 00:42:49,052
So...

347
00:42:53,033 --> 00:42:55,398
So you're saying
you're open to a deal?

348
00:42:56,503 --> 00:42:58,232
How much are you expecting?

349
00:42:59,305 --> 00:43:01,397
I can't say it just straight out

350
00:43:02,008 --> 00:43:03,565
This isn't a business transaction,
you know

351
00:43:03,942 --> 00:43:06,878
You must have a figure in mind

352
00:43:07,180 --> 00:43:08,340
Please say it.

353
00:43:09,616 --> 00:43:11,084
One officer told me...

354
00:43:13,119 --> 00:43:15,850
It's at least 20 million won
in a case like this

355
00:43:17,558 --> 00:43:23,429
As I just said, he's gone beyond
forgiveness this time

356
00:43:25,233 --> 00:43:27,792
It's true that he's my brother,
but I'll have to disown him

357
00:43:28,936 --> 00:43:30,870
It may sound harsh,

358
00:43:31,839 --> 00:43:33,967
but I think society
needs to be protected from him

359
00:43:36,745 --> 00:43:40,203
But have you listened
to what your sister said?

360
00:43:40,949 --> 00:43:41,813
About what?

361
00:43:42,452 --> 00:43:44,385
About what happened tonight

362
00:43:45,955 --> 00:43:46,979
What do you mean, what happened?

363
00:43:48,558 --> 00:43:51,926
What the hell do you think happened?
Isn't it obvious?

364
00:43:53,929 --> 00:43:55,329
Can't you see with your own eyes?

365
00:44:02,305 --> 00:44:03,773
Motherfuckers!

366
00:44:10,148 --> 00:44:12,445
How did the assailant
gain entry to the apartment?

367
00:44:17,889 --> 00:44:22,553
Miss, take your time and speak slowly

368
00:44:29,501 --> 00:44:31,993
She gets worse when
she's stressed and nervous

369
00:44:34,707 --> 00:44:39,235
We leave a key in the flowerpot
on the balcony

370
00:44:40,412 --> 00:44:42,073
He must've seen
the neighbor leave it there

371
00:44:42,882 --> 00:44:45,852
Did he threaten you with
a knife or any other weapon?

372
00:44:53,760 --> 00:44:55,022
There were no weapons

373
00:44:55,628 --> 00:44:57,961
Who'd need a weapon to
overpower her?

374
00:44:58,732 --> 00:45:01,724
Is this the clothing
the victim was wearing?

375
00:45:04,471 --> 00:45:05,530
It is

376
00:45:05,606 --> 00:45:10,134
And this is the bedsheet?

377
00:45:11,045 --> 00:45:13,012
It is

378
00:45:13,613 --> 00:45:16,412
And is that man the assailant?

379
00:45:17,151 --> 00:45:19,949
Hey, you! Stand up! Now!

380
00:45:25,127 --> 00:45:26,094
Is that him?

381
00:45:28,997 --> 00:45:30,022
Yes

382
00:45:30,266 --> 00:45:33,258
I think we're through!
Take him away to the cells

383
00:45:39,243 --> 00:45:43,406
Miss, you're safe now

384
00:45:44,513 --> 00:45:47,779
Nothing more to be afraid of

385
00:45:50,053 --> 00:45:52,386
Are the statements true?

386
00:45:54,324 --> 00:45:55,792
Yes, they are

387
00:45:57,895 --> 00:46:00,990
Have you been offered any
guarantee for hospital bills?

388
00:46:02,033 --> 00:46:04,695
Honey, they're asking
if we've had any guarantees

389
00:46:04,936 --> 00:46:05,903
No

390
00:46:07,238 --> 00:46:08,466
No guarantees

391
00:46:08,572 --> 00:46:11,405
What's wrong, dear?
There's nothing to be scared of now

392
00:46:15,247 --> 00:46:17,215
Everything's alright now

393
00:46:21,920 --> 00:46:24,685
What are you staring at, bastard?

394
00:46:25,056 --> 00:46:27,321
Why are you hitting him like that?

395
00:46:27,393 --> 00:46:29,918
I didn't, I just shoved him

396
00:46:29,996 --> 00:46:31,258
I saw you hit him just now!

397
00:46:31,330 --> 00:46:32,559
What the fuck are you saying?

398
00:46:32,698 --> 00:46:36,896
Who the fuck do you think you are,
talking to me like that?

399
00:47:12,408 --> 00:47:13,898
Do something

400
00:47:19,114 --> 00:47:25,384
Calm down... Calm down...

401
00:47:28,290 --> 00:47:34,230
It's almost over...

402
00:47:35,098 --> 00:47:36,793
Gong-Ju...

403
00:47:38,601 --> 00:47:40,570
Hold on, just a little longer, okay?

404
00:48:03,394 --> 00:48:06,660
Try to forget everything and sleep

405
00:48:07,232 --> 00:48:10,532
You'll feel better
after a good night's sleep

406
00:48:11,070 --> 00:48:13,230
We'll stay here tonight

407
00:48:13,338 --> 00:48:15,239
So there's nothing to be afraid of

408
00:48:34,994 --> 00:48:36,189
Hands behind your back

409
00:49:01,390 --> 00:49:04,257
You wretched boy!

410
00:49:05,394 --> 00:49:08,158
Remember our pastor, right?

411
00:49:09,366 --> 00:49:10,992
He wants to see you

412
00:49:11,467 --> 00:49:14,197
He wants to pray for you,
so that's why I brought him

413
00:49:15,871 --> 00:49:20,808
Jong-Du, the best thing
at a time like this is prayer

414
00:49:21,645 --> 00:49:22,805
Let's all be seated

415
00:49:25,048 --> 00:49:25,480
Sit down

416
00:49:25,549 --> 00:49:30,613
Excuse me, but could you take off
his handcuffs while we pray?

417
00:49:44,702 --> 00:49:46,034
Let us pray

418
00:49:48,105 --> 00:49:51,632
Dear Father almighty...

419
00:49:52,444 --> 00:49:58,975
Please forgive this poor lost sheep
as he struggles to find salvation

420
00:49:59,619 --> 00:50:03,612
Help him to find his way back,
resisting all temptation

421
00:50:05,824 --> 00:50:08,521
Hey, catch him!

422
00:50:13,599 --> 00:50:14,828
Pastor!

423
00:50:14,901 --> 00:50:18,564
Dear Father almighty!
Dear Father almighty!

424
00:50:22,942 --> 00:50:28,381
Please forgive this poor lost sheep

425
00:50:54,544 --> 00:51:00,312
Shut up, you fucking bitch!
I'll kill you!

426
00:51:02,018 --> 00:51:06,615
Where's your phone?
Give me your phone, now!

427
00:51:17,167 --> 00:51:20,796
Stay still or I'll kill you

428
00:51:25,376 --> 00:51:28,641
Hello? Is that Han Gong-Ju's
apartment?

429
00:51:29,380 --> 00:51:31,871
May I speak to Gong-Ju?

430
00:51:33,451 --> 00:51:36,511
Me?
My name is Hong Jong-Du

431
00:51:38,390 --> 00:51:43,953
Sorry, but let me speak to Gong-Ju

432
00:51:44,997 --> 00:51:46,294
Fuck!

433
00:52:04,818 --> 00:52:07,252
Piss off, bitch!

434
00:52:27,476 --> 00:52:28,772
Careful, it's hot

435
00:52:28,843 --> 00:52:29,833
Thanks

436
00:53:49,161 --> 00:53:50,493
What's going on?

437
00:54:27,804 --> 00:54:28,861
Come down from there!

438
00:54:32,976 --> 00:54:34,169
You fucking bastard!

439
00:54:38,847 --> 00:54:42,648
Hong Jong-Du, come down!

440
00:55:10,682 --> 00:55:14,015
What the hell do you think
you're doing up there?

441
00:55:14,352 --> 00:55:15,910
Get down, you fucker!

442
00:55:16,121 --> 00:55:18,988
Hey, watch out!

443
00:55:21,894 --> 00:55:23,589
That guy is completely crazy!

444
00:56:41,145 --> 00:56:42,305
Be quiet out there!

445
00:56:48,184 --> 00:56:49,083
What're you doing?

446
00:56:49,287 --> 00:56:50,151
Pardon?

447
00:56:50,821 --> 00:56:52,084
What are you doing there?

448
00:56:52,490 --> 00:56:54,185
Cutting off the branches

449
00:56:54,292 --> 00:56:57,386
You're waking up
the whole neighborhood

450
00:57:17,650 --> 00:57:18,617
What's going on?

451
00:57:19,051 --> 00:57:20,883
That guy isn't normal

452
00:57:23,090 --> 00:57:26,059
What are you doing up there?
Climb down!

453
00:57:59,161 --> 00:58:03,258
There's only one branch left!
You're doing great!

454
00:58:05,767 --> 00:58:08,964
Saw that off and come down, okay?

455
00:58:09,572 --> 00:58:10,800
Your Highness!

456
00:58:11,841 --> 00:58:13,706
Your Highness!

457
00:58:20,751 --> 00:58:21,911
Is he hurt?

458
00:58:30,828 --> 00:58:31,816
Cuff him, quick!

459
00:58:34,465 --> 00:58:35,124
Take him away!

460
00:59:32,294 --> 00:59:33,590
What the hell is it now?

461
00:59:33,694 --> 00:59:37,187
Can't you keep the noise down?

462
00:59:37,732 --> 00:59:40,223
What are you all doing out there
at this time of night?

463
00:59:40,502 --> 00:59:42,800
There are young people
trying to study!

464
00:59:43,805 --> 00:59:47,070
This has gone on long enough!

465
01:00:24,949 --> 01:00:29,886
Your Highness, this is your general

466
01:00:30,655 --> 01:00:32,748
I hope you're doing well,
staying healthy and everything

467
01:00:33,158 --> 01:00:36,218
I'm doing alright here,
taking care of myself

468
01:00:36,861 --> 01:00:38,762
Getting used to the
''bean meals'' here again...

469
01:00:39,598 --> 01:00:43,193
But, don't worry,
they don't actually serve beans

470
01:00:43,970 --> 01:00:48,429
But when the odd bean gets mixed in,
I always think of you

471
01:00:48,974 --> 01:00:50,498
Now I don't like beans, either

472
01:00:51,177 --> 01:00:56,047
I'm dreaming of the day I can
eat tofu when I get out of here

473
01:00:30,019 --> 01:00:33,456
You must be so bored,
all alone in your apartment

474
01:00:35,572 --> 01:00:44,043
I play soccer and table tennis
and other things to keep fit

475
01:01:10,398 --> 01:01:12,024
So don't worry about me

476
01:01:12,866 --> 01:01:16,563
When I get out,
I'll buy you lots of delicious food

477
01:01:16,703 --> 01:01:18,899
Make a list of all the things
you want to eat

478
01:01:19,674 --> 01:01:24,169
Until I write you again,
take care of your precious person

479
01:01:24,913 --> 01:01:26,540
Goodbye for now
