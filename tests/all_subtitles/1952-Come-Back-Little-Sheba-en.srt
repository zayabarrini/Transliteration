1
00:01:39,225 --> 00:01:42,558
Good morning.
You've come to see the room?

2
00:01:42,728 --> 00:01:45,136
Yes, I have. I'm Marie Buckholder.

3
00:01:45,314 --> 00:01:49,063
Oh. How are you, dear?
You're from the university?

4
00:01:49,235 --> 00:01:52,520
- Yes. I hope I didn't get you up.
- Oh, no, honey.

5
00:01:52,697 --> 00:01:54,855
I had to get up, anyway.

6
00:01:55,950 --> 00:01:59,817
It's up here. Is this the first room
you looked for?

7
00:01:59,995 --> 00:02:02,617
- Yes, it is.
- I hope you like it.

8
00:02:02,790 --> 00:02:06,622
- I'm sure I will.
- We haven't any children, you know.

9
00:02:06,794 --> 00:02:09,665
Come right in. Right in here.

10
00:02:10,423 --> 00:02:12,664
This is the room, honey.

11
00:02:12,842 --> 00:02:15,084
See? You got a closet.

12
00:02:16,137 --> 00:02:21,012
Nice, big closet.
And a lamp for reading.

13
00:02:22,059 --> 00:02:24,348
I'll have to get you a bulb.

14
00:02:25,229 --> 00:02:29,938
It's usually more quiet.
I guess a student needs it quiet.

15
00:02:30,109 --> 00:02:33,692
But today being Saturday,
the Coffman kids is home.

16
00:02:33,863 --> 00:02:36,151
The view isn't too important.

17
00:02:37,783 --> 00:02:41,947
- It ain't too much money?
- No, the price seems all right.

18
00:02:42,121 --> 00:02:44,327
Nice bed. A wonderful bed.

19
00:02:45,207 --> 00:02:48,742
Good mattress.
I know, 'cause I slept here myself.

20
00:02:48,919 --> 00:02:50,995
- You did?
- Well, not lately.

21
00:02:51,172 --> 00:02:55,039
My husband used to be sickly.
But he's all right now.

22
00:02:55,217 --> 00:02:58,551
I don't know, Mrs Delaney,
I'll think it over.

23
00:02:58,721 --> 00:03:01,888
There isn't anything
closer to the university.

24
00:03:02,058 --> 00:03:05,972
- It's very convenient, but...
- The bathroom's nice.

25
00:03:06,145 --> 00:03:08,814
I just had it repainted three years ago.

26
00:03:08,981 --> 00:03:13,524
We could put in another shelf
for your towels and things.

27
00:03:13,694 --> 00:03:16,731
- And that's...
- That's our room.

28
00:03:16,906 --> 00:03:19,397
My husband's asleep or I'd show you.

29
00:03:19,575 --> 00:03:21,651
My husband's a doctor.

30
00:03:21,827 --> 00:03:26,205
Not a real MD, a chiropractor.
But he's got a good practice.

31
00:03:26,374 --> 00:03:30,870
If you was interested in the front room,
I could speak to him.

32
00:03:31,045 --> 00:03:33,121
No, I wouldn't think of it.

33
00:03:33,297 --> 00:03:37,840
I just started looking
and I feel I should look around a bit.

34
00:03:38,010 --> 00:03:42,886
You could get your own meal.
Kitchen privileges, they call it.

35
00:03:43,057 --> 00:03:45,630
And I could get you your own key.

36
00:03:45,810 --> 00:03:49,759
You could come and go as...
That's my sewing room.

37
00:03:51,524 --> 00:03:55,652
- It's a little upset now.
- I will think it over.

38
00:03:56,987 --> 00:04:00,855
You could use the house
as if it was yours.

39
00:04:01,033 --> 00:04:04,236
We wouldn't interfere,
'cause we're very quiet.

40
00:04:04,412 --> 00:04:06,653
We don't have much company.

41
00:04:06,831 --> 00:04:11,208
- It's only two blocks to the bus.
- Yes, it's very convenient.

42
00:04:11,377 --> 00:04:16,751
- It's quite likely I will be back, only...
- I'll keep my fingers crossed.

43
00:04:16,924 --> 00:04:20,174
- Thanks a lot. Goodbye.
- Bye.

44
00:04:56,630 --> 00:05:00,759
- Who was that, Lola?
- Morning. I didn't hear ya.

45
00:05:00,926 --> 00:05:04,378
You know what I just thought I saw?
Little Sheba.

46
00:05:04,555 --> 00:05:07,307
But it was just some little grey dog.

47
00:05:07,475 --> 00:05:12,516
- Who was that upstairs with you?
- She's an awful sweet little thing.

48
00:05:12,688 --> 00:05:14,930
Her name is Marie Buckholder.

49
00:05:15,107 --> 00:05:17,729
She's a student at the university.

50
00:05:17,902 --> 00:05:21,816
I keep thinking
every little dog I see is Sheba.

51
00:05:21,989 --> 00:05:26,817
- What did Miss Buckholder want?
- She came about renting the bedroom.

52
00:05:26,994 --> 00:05:29,153
I called up the university.

53
00:05:29,330 --> 00:05:34,490
You know, Daddy. After all, six dollars
ain't to be sneezed at.

54
00:05:34,669 --> 00:05:39,081
- What are you thinking of?
- Lots of people rent rooms.

55
00:05:40,132 --> 00:05:42,208
Not the Delaneys.

56
00:05:43,135 --> 00:05:46,339
I didn't mean to upset you.
I just thought...

57
00:05:49,016 --> 00:05:50,973
- I don't want anybody here.
- Are you mad at me?

58
00:05:52,019 --> 00:05:54,475
You know, it ain't like before.

59
00:05:54,647 --> 00:05:59,724
Nobody'd see you getting drunk,
'cause you don't get drunk any more.

60
00:05:59,902 --> 00:06:05,276
When I remember the way you used
to be, drinking and getting into fights.

61
00:06:05,449 --> 00:06:09,364
- Please, baby.
- I'm sorry, Daddy.

62
00:06:10,413 --> 00:06:14,457
You gotta understand, honey.
Sure, I know I'm fine today.

63
00:06:14,625 --> 00:06:18,208
Today, I know I can control myself.
That's enough.

64
00:06:18,379 --> 00:06:20,668
Oh, sure, Doc.

65
00:06:20,840 --> 00:06:25,169
Gee, must have been after three
when you got home last night.

66
00:06:25,344 --> 00:06:29,259
Where was you working?
At the jail or the hospital?

67
00:06:29,432 --> 00:06:31,508
At the jail.

68
00:06:32,601 --> 00:06:36,385
- Want fruit juice?
- Oh, sure. Nice and cold.

69
00:06:40,568 --> 00:06:45,028
- You sure drink it up fast.
- You know what the doctor said.

70
00:06:45,197 --> 00:06:47,523
I'll stock in a lot today.

71
00:06:47,700 --> 00:06:50,820
I was sure there was still some left.

72
00:06:51,871 --> 00:06:55,820
Doc, can I go with you
to the AA meeting?

73
00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:58,491
- For your birthday party.
- Sure.

74
00:06:59,879 --> 00:07:03,579
- Wish I had some orange juice.
- I'll go to the store.

75
00:07:03,758 --> 00:07:08,384
- Don't bother.
- Oh, it won't take a minute.

76
00:07:08,554 --> 00:07:13,133
- I can get some on the way to work.
- No, let me do it for you.

77
00:07:13,309 --> 00:07:16,594
I'll be right back. Won't take a second.

78
00:07:28,657 --> 00:07:30,734
Mrs Delaney?

79
00:07:37,792 --> 00:07:40,995
- I'm Miss Buckholder.
- Mrs Delaney's out.

80
00:07:41,170 --> 00:07:45,499
I've come about renting the room,
and not the upstairs room.

81
00:07:45,675 --> 00:07:50,917
If Mrs Delaney could let me have
this one, it's really what I had in mind.

82
00:07:51,097 --> 00:07:53,385
More a studio than a bedroom.

83
00:07:53,557 --> 00:07:55,633
I was here a few minutes ago.

84
00:07:55,810 --> 00:08:01,314
You see, I'm studying art
and this would work out just great.

85
00:08:01,482 --> 00:08:05,562
D'you think she'd consider it?
But if I'd be in your way...

86
00:08:05,736 --> 00:08:11,075
- It's rather far from the bathroom.
- Running up stairs keeps my legs slim.

87
00:08:11,242 --> 00:08:17,197
If I have to run in and out and it's late,
I won't be bothering you.

88
00:08:17,373 --> 00:08:20,576
Mrs Delaney said
I could move in right away.

89
00:08:20,751 --> 00:08:22,827
Right away?

90
00:08:23,004 --> 00:08:26,254
Well, then... then why don't you?

91
00:08:26,424 --> 00:08:30,635
- She wouldn't mind it being this room?
- It's my house.

92
00:08:30,803 --> 00:08:35,928
That's just wonderful! Thank you
so much, Mr... Doctor Delaney.

93
00:08:39,353 --> 00:08:42,556
She said two weeks in advance
was satisfactory.

94
00:08:42,732 --> 00:08:46,147
- That can wait till later.
- No, I insist.

95
00:08:48,195 --> 00:08:53,616
Tell her I'll be moving in around
four o'clock. Oh, gee, thanks so much.

96
00:08:53,784 --> 00:08:55,943
I hope I didn't disturb you.

97
00:09:09,216 --> 00:09:11,292
Daddy?

98
00:09:21,145 --> 00:09:23,221
Doc?

99
00:09:28,194 --> 00:09:31,111
Oh. Daddy, why didn't you answer me?

100
00:09:31,280 --> 00:09:34,898
- I didn't hear you.
- I thought you'd gone.

101
00:09:35,076 --> 00:09:38,860
- I rented your room.
- Did that nice girl come back?

102
00:09:39,038 --> 00:09:42,952
Your sewing room.
You'll have to take your things out.

103
00:09:43,125 --> 00:09:46,411
- Sure.
- There's your first two weeks' rent.

104
00:09:46,587 --> 00:09:48,876
Oh. Thanks, Daddy.

105
00:09:51,092 --> 00:09:53,417
The money'll come in handy.

106
00:10:08,275 --> 00:10:10,102
Good evening.

107
00:10:10,277 --> 00:10:13,943
- Hello.
- Hello.

108
00:10:25,459 --> 00:10:27,997
May I have your attention, please?

109
00:10:29,630 --> 00:10:33,794
Good evening. My name
is Ed Anderson, I'm an alcoholic.

110
00:10:33,968 --> 00:10:36,506
I'm happy to welcome you to the AA.

111
00:10:36,679 --> 00:10:38,755
Those of you who are new,

112
00:10:38,931 --> 00:10:43,260
I hope you find what I found when I
walked in that door five years ago.

113
00:10:43,436 --> 00:10:47,433
First, let's have
all the alcoholics raise their hands.

114
00:10:49,817 --> 00:10:54,728
Thank you. Now those of you
who are here for the first time.

115
00:10:58,242 --> 00:11:00,650
It's good to have you here.

116
00:11:00,828 --> 00:11:05,289
Now for the birthday babies.
Elmo Chester, four years.

117
00:11:14,300 --> 00:11:16,707
Pearl Stimson, three years.

118
00:11:24,226 --> 00:11:26,896
Henrietta Colby, two years.

119
00:11:31,233 --> 00:11:33,309
Doc Delaney, one year.

120
00:11:52,880 --> 00:11:54,956
Elmo.

121
00:11:58,803 --> 00:12:01,638
It's a long time between drinks.

122
00:12:06,852 --> 00:12:08,928
Pearl.

123
00:12:14,652 --> 00:12:18,602
Three years ago, I wouldn't have
the wind to do this.

124
00:12:22,410 --> 00:12:24,486
Henrietta.

125
00:12:29,166 --> 00:12:32,416
I don't know...
I don't know what to say,

126
00:12:32,586 --> 00:12:37,047
except I thank God and
all my friends here who've helped me.

127
00:12:42,388 --> 00:12:43,882
Doc.

128
00:12:51,480 --> 00:12:55,145
- I never thought I'd make it.
- Neither did I.

129
00:13:05,786 --> 00:13:08,704
- Hi there.
- Hello.

130
00:13:08,873 --> 00:13:11,364
I bet I know who you're writing to.

131
00:13:11,542 --> 00:13:14,993
I got a real long one from him today.
Four pages.

132
00:13:15,171 --> 00:13:19,500
- Was it as interesting as usual?
- Especially interesting.

133
00:13:19,675 --> 00:13:24,218
You hear that, Daddy?
Doc, she got a letter from Bruce.

134
00:13:24,388 --> 00:13:27,804
- Bruce?
- As if you didn't know who that was.

135
00:13:27,975 --> 00:13:31,261
You hear that, Marie?
The boy she's engaged to.

136
00:13:31,437 --> 00:13:35,138
- The young man back home.
- We're not exactly engaged.

137
00:13:35,316 --> 00:13:39,563
I just got my eye on him. You sound
tired, Doc. What'd you see tonight?

138
00:13:39,737 --> 00:13:44,944
Oh, we didn't go to a movie. We...
We went to see some friends.

139
00:13:45,117 --> 00:13:48,985
- Night.
- I'll be up in a minute, Doc.

140
00:13:50,247 --> 00:13:52,323
Did Bruce get his raise?

141
00:13:52,500 --> 00:13:57,660
He's getting $300 a month and
expenses and he gets to fly everywhere.

142
00:13:57,838 --> 00:14:00,246
Oh, that's wonderful.

143
00:14:03,260 --> 00:14:05,467
Well, I guess you're busy.

144
00:14:06,514 --> 00:14:09,265
- Night, Marie.
- Good night, Mrs Delaney.

145
00:14:09,433 --> 00:14:12,007
What about a little music?

146
00:14:12,186 --> 00:14:15,306
I always think music
helps with letter writing.

147
00:14:34,917 --> 00:14:37,622
Marie should really marry that fella.

148
00:14:37,795 --> 00:14:41,745
He makes $300 a month
and he gets to fly every place.

149
00:14:41,924 --> 00:14:44,545
Thought she wants to get an education.

150
00:14:44,719 --> 00:14:48,847
Drawing pictures?
That's what she studies the most of.

151
00:14:53,227 --> 00:14:57,604
Honey, do me a favour. I don't want
Marie to know about me being in AA.

152
00:14:57,773 --> 00:15:03,942
But that's the first thing the AAs
teach you, to admit you're an alcoholic.

153
00:15:04,113 --> 00:15:07,529
I'll tell everybody
when I'm more sure of myself.

154
00:15:07,700 --> 00:15:12,658
You certainly ought to be sure
after tonight. I was so proud of you.

155
00:15:12,830 --> 00:15:17,207
You looked so nice standing up there
in front of all those people.

156
00:15:20,463 --> 00:15:23,380
- This too much air?
- Fine.

157
00:15:28,721 --> 00:15:33,134
I'm too tired to wash my face tonight.
Did you?

158
00:15:34,352 --> 00:15:38,301
She must spend a fortune
on bath powders and salts.

159
00:15:38,481 --> 00:15:41,054
That bathroom smells like a lilac factory.

160
00:15:41,233 --> 00:15:43,559
Oh, yeah. I like it.

161
00:16:00,461 --> 00:16:03,747
I dreamt about Little Sheba again
last night, Doc.

162
00:16:03,923 --> 00:16:06,710
- You did?
- Yes.

163
00:16:08,469 --> 00:16:10,545
It was just as real.

164
00:16:10,721 --> 00:16:15,099
I put her on a leash to take her
downtown to do some shopping.

165
00:16:15,267 --> 00:16:18,553
Everybody on the street
turned around to look at her.

166
00:16:18,729 --> 00:16:20,971
I was so proud.

167
00:16:22,066 --> 00:16:24,391
Then we started to walk.

168
00:16:24,568 --> 00:16:27,937
And the blocks started going by so fast,

169
00:16:28,114 --> 00:16:31,483
poor Little Sheba
couldn't keep up with me.

170
00:16:31,659 --> 00:16:35,075
Suddenly, I looked around
and she was gone.

171
00:16:36,247 --> 00:16:38,323
Ain't that funny?

172
00:16:38,499 --> 00:16:41,950
I looked everywhere for her,
but I couldn't find her.

173
00:16:43,004 --> 00:16:49,291
I stood there, feeling kind of afraid.
Do you suppose that means anything?

174
00:16:50,636 --> 00:16:55,097
- Daddy? Are you asleep?
- Dreams are funny.

175
00:16:56,267 --> 00:17:00,099
Do you suppose it means
Little Sheba's gonna come back?

176
00:17:00,271 --> 00:17:02,347
I don't know, baby.

177
00:17:07,319 --> 00:17:09,396
I miss her so.

178
00:17:11,032 --> 00:17:13,902
She was such a cute little puppy.

179
00:17:15,036 --> 00:17:18,820
- Wasn't she cute?
- Yes, she was cute.

180
00:17:20,374 --> 00:17:25,416
Remember how white and fluffy
she used to be after I gave her a bath?

181
00:17:26,630 --> 00:17:32,217
And how her little hind end wagged
from side to side when she walked?

182
00:17:32,386 --> 00:17:34,462
I remember.

183
00:17:37,308 --> 00:17:40,262
I just hated to see her grow old.

184
00:17:40,436 --> 00:17:43,935
Little Sheba should have
stayed young forever.

185
00:17:44,106 --> 00:17:48,768
Some things should never grow old.
That's what it amounts to, I guess.

186
00:17:59,830 --> 00:18:03,994
- Hi!
- Hello! How's our star boarder today?

187
00:18:04,168 --> 00:18:06,706
- Want your breakfast?
- Just fruit juice.

188
00:18:06,879 --> 00:18:09,714
You look lovelier than a spring garden.

189
00:18:10,633 --> 00:18:12,839
You sure you wouldn't like a roll?

190
00:18:13,010 --> 00:18:18,301
I got to get to the library, check out
some special books before anyone else.

191
00:18:18,474 --> 00:18:23,432
You want to study hard, be a fine artist
someday. Paint beautiful pictures.

192
00:18:23,604 --> 00:18:26,807
I remember a picture my mother had
over the mantelpiece.

193
00:18:26,982 --> 00:18:29,271
A picture of a cathedral in a sunset.

194
00:18:29,443 --> 00:18:33,488
It made you feel religious
just to look at it.

195
00:18:33,656 --> 00:18:36,443
These books are for biology.
I have an exam.

196
00:18:36,617 --> 00:18:38,776
- That enough?
- Fine.

197
00:18:38,953 --> 00:18:41,029
See you later.

198
00:19:04,020 --> 00:19:06,392
- Morning, honey.
- Morning, dear.

199
00:19:12,069 --> 00:19:14,904
I can't sleep late like I used to.

200
00:19:15,072 --> 00:19:18,904
I used to be able to sleep
till noon if I wanted to.

201
00:19:19,076 --> 00:19:22,196
- I can't any more, I don't know why.
- Habits change.

202
00:19:22,371 --> 00:19:26,998
Maybe it's the spring. Everything else
is stirring, why shouldn't you?

203
00:19:29,837 --> 00:19:33,787
I should be getting your breakfast,
but you're getting mine.

204
00:19:36,260 --> 00:19:39,131
- Did you say your prayer?
- Yes, baby.

205
00:19:40,181 --> 00:19:43,881
Did you ask God to be with you
and keep you strong?

206
00:19:44,060 --> 00:19:48,104
- Yes, baby.
- Then God'll be with you, Doccy.

207
00:19:52,318 --> 00:19:56,446
Say your prayer for me, Daddy.
I love to hear it.

208
00:19:58,657 --> 00:20:02,821
God grant me the serenity
to accept the things I cannot change,

209
00:20:02,995 --> 00:20:08,072
courage to change the things I can, and
wisdom always to know the difference.

210
00:20:09,377 --> 00:20:14,085
That's so nice. That's so pretty.

211
00:20:15,299 --> 00:20:18,633
When I think of the way
you used to be, Daddy,

212
00:20:18,803 --> 00:20:21,720
always drinking and getting into fights.

213
00:20:21,889 --> 00:20:26,053
I was always so scared.
I never knew what was gonna happen.

214
00:20:26,227 --> 00:20:29,181
I don't know what I'd have done
without you.

215
00:20:29,355 --> 00:20:33,055
I'm so proud of you.
You been sober over a year.

216
00:20:35,236 --> 00:20:40,028
- Mr Cruthers is coming to the office.
- Oh, he said he never would.

217
00:20:40,199 --> 00:20:43,449
It goes to show you
people are nicer than you think.

218
00:20:43,619 --> 00:20:47,368
- They always give you another chance.
- Oh, sure.

219
00:20:51,961 --> 00:20:55,294
Maybe... maybe you could take me
to a movie tonight?

220
00:20:56,340 --> 00:20:59,709
- I have to do some Twelfth Step work.
- Again?

221
00:20:59,885 --> 00:21:04,013
It's important. You help yourself
by helping other alcoholics.

222
00:21:04,181 --> 00:21:07,099
Alcoholics are mostly disappointed men.

223
00:21:07,268 --> 00:21:10,185
Oh. Sure, I know.

224
00:21:12,857 --> 00:21:16,107
You wasn't ever disappointed,
were you, Doc?

225
00:21:16,277 --> 00:21:18,353
The thing is not to dwell on the past,

226
00:21:18,529 --> 00:21:22,609
to live each day as it comes,
and stay sober doing it.

227
00:21:25,411 --> 00:21:29,574
- Who are you gonna help tonight?
- Some fellow they found on skid row.

228
00:21:29,749 --> 00:21:33,248
He's down at the city hospital.
I kind of dread it.

229
00:21:33,419 --> 00:21:35,495
You said it helped you.

230
00:21:35,671 --> 00:21:37,878
It does if you can stand it.

231
00:21:38,049 --> 00:21:41,714
I did some Twelfth Step work
there myself once before.

232
00:21:41,886 --> 00:21:45,171
They put the alcoholics
in with the crazy people.

233
00:21:45,348 --> 00:21:47,424
Horrible.

234
00:21:47,600 --> 00:21:50,138
These men, all twisted and shaking.

235
00:21:50,311 --> 00:21:52,802
Eyes all foggy and full of pain.

236
00:21:52,980 --> 00:21:57,060
One fellow had his hands clamped
together so he wouldn't kill anyone.

237
00:21:57,234 --> 00:22:00,603
There was a young man,
scratched his eyes out.

238
00:22:00,780 --> 00:22:03,105
Oh, don't, Daddy.

239
00:22:03,282 --> 00:22:06,651
It's awful they take 'em there,
just 'cause they get drunk.

240
00:22:06,827 --> 00:22:11,454
They'll sober him up, that's the
important thing. Let's not talk about it.

241
00:22:11,624 --> 00:22:14,162
Maybe Marie
can go to a movie with you.

242
00:22:14,335 --> 00:22:17,786
No, she's probably going out
somewheres with Turk.

243
00:22:20,966 --> 00:22:24,086
She shouldn't be going out
with a fellow like Turk.

244
00:22:24,261 --> 00:22:27,179
I don't know why you say that.
Turk's nice.

245
00:22:27,348 --> 00:22:30,515
Fellow like that has no respect
for nice, young girls.

246
00:22:30,685 --> 00:22:33,140
I can tell just by looking at him.

247
00:22:34,397 --> 00:22:38,975
You think every girl is like Jennifer
Jones in <i>The Song of Bernadette</i>.

248
00:22:39,151 --> 00:22:43,019
I like to believe that young people
like her are clean and decent.

249
00:22:43,197 --> 00:22:46,317
- Hi.
- Hi, honey. My, you're up early.

250
00:22:46,492 --> 00:22:48,948
- You want any breakfast?
- No, thank you.

251
00:22:49,120 --> 00:22:52,405
It's such a nice morning,
why don't you walk with me?

252
00:22:52,581 --> 00:22:56,959
- Yeah, Daddy, it'll do you good.
- I might come home for lunch.

253
00:22:57,128 --> 00:22:59,963
Fine. I'll fix something hot for you.

254
00:23:00,131 --> 00:23:02,966
- I hope I'm not rushing you.
- Not at all.

255
00:23:03,134 --> 00:23:07,511
Have a good day. That's all right,
Daddy, you go on.

256
00:23:07,680 --> 00:23:10,847
- Bye, you two, have fun.
- Wanna walk to the office?

257
00:23:11,017 --> 00:23:14,801
- No, Daddy, I ain't even dressed.
- Kiss Daddy goodbye.

258
00:23:14,979 --> 00:23:17,766
- Bye-bye.
- Aren't you gonna kiss me goodbye?

259
00:23:17,940 --> 00:23:21,689
- Go on, Doc.
- Can't spend time kissing all the girls.

260
00:23:28,242 --> 00:23:31,492
- Can I carry those?
- They're not heavy, I can manage.

261
00:23:31,662 --> 00:23:34,200
It would look silly, a man my age.

262
00:23:34,373 --> 00:23:39,580
A lot of men your age go to school.
I guess you had your share of college.

263
00:23:39,754 --> 00:23:42,708
You can always tell
when a man's educated.

264
00:23:42,882 --> 00:23:45,337
And isn't that a Phi Beta Kappa key?

265
00:23:45,509 --> 00:23:49,507
I found it in a drawer the other day.
You're observant, Marie.

266
00:23:49,680 --> 00:23:53,927
- Where'd you go?
- Mead. Most people never heard of it.

267
00:23:54,101 --> 00:23:57,268
If they know anything
about medical colleges they have.

268
00:23:57,438 --> 00:24:01,685
It's to medicine what Harvard is to law.
I had an uncle who went there.

269
00:24:01,859 --> 00:24:04,979
Do people usually go to Mead
to become chiropractors?

270
00:24:05,154 --> 00:24:08,605
- Well, I... I didn't finish there.
- What happened?

271
00:24:08,783 --> 00:24:11,190
Well, I... I just didn't finish.

272
00:24:11,369 --> 00:24:13,776
You take biology? You like it?

273
00:24:13,954 --> 00:24:18,118
Sure. What's more interesting than
nature, especially our own bodies?

274
00:24:19,168 --> 00:24:21,291
Speaking of bodies, my friend Turk.

275
00:24:23,673 --> 00:24:26,839
This is where I have to leave you.
Have a good day.

276
00:24:27,009 --> 00:24:30,010
- Same to you, Marie.
- Hey, Turk.

277
00:24:31,055 --> 00:24:35,218
- If it isn't Mrs Rembrandt.
- Got room for me on your handlebars?

278
00:24:41,190 --> 00:24:45,769
- Hello, Mrs Coffman. How are you?
- Thank you, fine, Mrs Delaney.

279
00:24:48,072 --> 00:24:50,741
You're the busiest woman I ever saw.

280
00:24:50,908 --> 00:24:53,446
Keeping busy is keeping happy.

281
00:24:53,619 --> 00:24:57,783
With four kids to look after,
you've got no time to sit around.

282
00:24:57,957 --> 00:25:01,123
- No, I suppose not.
- You don't hear me complain.

283
00:25:01,293 --> 00:25:03,867
Oh, no, you never complain.

284
00:25:04,046 --> 00:25:07,498
I wouldn't, either, if I had
a little cutie like Gretchen.

285
00:25:07,675 --> 00:25:09,798
She's such a darling.

286
00:25:11,262 --> 00:25:16,220
I'm afraid my little doggy has gone
for good, Mrs Coffman. I miss her so.

287
00:25:16,392 --> 00:25:20,306
The only way to keep from
missing one dog is to get another.

288
00:25:20,479 --> 00:25:24,773
No, I never could find another
little doggy as cute as Little Sheba.

289
00:25:26,235 --> 00:25:30,696
I put an ad in the paper
for two weeks, but nobody answered it.

290
00:25:30,865 --> 00:25:35,491
It's just like she vanished.
Just vanished into thin air.

291
00:25:35,661 --> 00:25:38,496
That was months ago, Mrs Delaney.

292
00:25:38,664 --> 00:25:43,243
You should get busy and forget her.
You should get busy, Mrs Delaney.

293
00:25:43,419 --> 00:25:48,923
Yeah, I'm going to. As a matter of fact,
I've got something cooking now.

294
00:25:49,091 --> 00:25:51,214
See you later.

295
00:26:11,864 --> 00:26:15,648
- Hello, Mr Postman. How are you?
- Morning.

296
00:26:15,826 --> 00:26:18,198
You better have something for me.

297
00:26:18,371 --> 00:26:22,202
Sometimes I think
you don't even know I live here.

298
00:26:22,375 --> 00:26:25,874
It's been two weeks
since you brought me anything.

299
00:26:26,045 --> 00:26:29,793
If you can't do any better,
I'll have to get a new postman.

300
00:26:29,965 --> 00:26:35,007
You'll have to get someone to write you
some letters. Nothing for you.

301
00:26:35,179 --> 00:26:38,844
I was just joking.
You knew I was joking, didn't you?

302
00:26:39,016 --> 00:26:43,762
I bet you're thirsty. Come in and
I'll get you a nice, cold glass of water.

303
00:26:43,938 --> 00:26:46,808
Come in and rest your feet for a while.

304
00:26:46,982 --> 00:26:50,850
I'll take you up on that.
I've worked up quite a thirst.

305
00:26:51,028 --> 00:26:53,946
You sit down there. I won't be a minute.

306
00:26:55,825 --> 00:26:57,948
Won't be a minute.

307
00:26:59,704 --> 00:27:04,330
Feel free to ask me for a glass of water
any time you wanna.

308
00:27:04,500 --> 00:27:08,628
That's what we're here for,
to make each other comfortable.

309
00:27:08,796 --> 00:27:10,623
Thank you, ma'am.

310
00:27:10,798 --> 00:27:14,878
- I hope you can't taste the cantaloupe.
- Is that what it is?

311
00:27:15,052 --> 00:27:17,887
- I'll get you some fresh.
- No, this is fine.

312
00:27:19,181 --> 00:27:22,764
You haven't been our postman
very long, have you?

313
00:27:22,935 --> 00:27:25,556
You postmen have things pretty nice.

314
00:27:25,730 --> 00:27:30,308
I hear you get a nice pension
from the government after 20 years.

315
00:27:30,484 --> 00:27:34,185
I think that's fine. It's a good job, too.

316
00:27:34,363 --> 00:27:36,155
You may get tired,

317
00:27:36,323 --> 00:27:40,867
but it's good for a man to be outdoors
and get a lot of exercise.

318
00:27:41,037 --> 00:27:43,325
My husband is a chiropractor.

319
00:27:43,497 --> 00:27:47,329
He has to stay inside his office
all day long.

320
00:27:47,501 --> 00:27:52,080
The only exercise he gets
is rubbing people's backbones.

321
00:27:52,256 --> 00:27:55,459
But it makes his hands
awful strong, you know.

322
00:27:55,634 --> 00:28:00,380
He's got the strongest hands
you ever saw. But a weak digestion.

323
00:28:00,556 --> 00:28:03,343
- You want any more?
- No, thanks.

324
00:28:05,770 --> 00:28:09,554
You know, my husband
is Alcoholics Anonymous.

325
00:28:09,732 --> 00:28:12,686
He wouldn't mind if I told you.
He's proud of it.

326
00:28:12,860 --> 00:28:15,814
He hasn't touched a drop in over a year.

327
00:28:15,988 --> 00:28:21,030
All that time, we've had a bottle of
whisky in the kitchen. Just for company.

328
00:28:21,202 --> 00:28:24,405
He hasn't even gone near it.
Doesn't even want to.

329
00:28:24,580 --> 00:28:29,538
Alcoholics can't drink like
ordinary people. They're allergic to it.

330
00:28:29,710 --> 00:28:34,503
They start drinking and they can't stop.
Liquor transforms them.

331
00:28:34,674 --> 00:28:38,043
But if they leave liquor alone,
they're perfectly all right.

332
00:28:38,219 --> 00:28:40,342
They're just like you and me.

333
00:28:40,513 --> 00:28:43,882
You should've seen Doc
before he gave it up. He was awful.

334
00:28:44,058 --> 00:28:47,509
He lost all his patients,
he didn't wanna go to the office.

335
00:28:47,687 --> 00:28:51,471
He just wanted
to stay drunk all day long.

336
00:28:51,649 --> 00:28:55,978
You wouldn't believe it now.
He's got all his patients back.

337
00:28:56,153 --> 00:28:58,775
- He's doing just fine.
- I know Dr Delaney.

338
00:28:58,948 --> 00:29:02,483
I deliver mail to his office.
He's a very fine man.

339
00:29:02,660 --> 00:29:06,159
- You don't drink, do you?
- Just a few beers once in a while.

340
00:29:06,330 --> 00:29:09,331
I don't think that stuff
is good for anybody.

341
00:29:11,043 --> 00:29:14,163
- You got any kids?
- I got three grandchildren.

342
00:29:14,338 --> 00:29:19,629
We don't have any and we get these
toys in our boxes of breakfast foods.

343
00:29:19,802 --> 00:29:23,752
I usually save them
for the Coffman kids, but you take it.

344
00:29:23,931 --> 00:29:27,134
- That's very kind of you.
- That's all right.

345
00:29:27,309 --> 00:29:30,061
Goodbye, Mr Postman.

346
00:29:30,229 --> 00:29:33,930
You're gonna get a letter
if I have to write it myself.

347
00:29:34,108 --> 00:29:37,607
- Thanks. Bye.
- Bye.

348
00:29:58,758 --> 00:30:01,331
<i>Taboo.</i>

349
00:30:01,510 --> 00:30:08,012
<i>It's Taboo, radio listeners,</i>
<i>your 15 minutes of temptation.</i>

350
00:30:13,439 --> 00:30:15,515
<i>Won't you join me?</i>

351
00:30:15,691 --> 00:30:18,313
<i>Won't you leave behind your routine,</i>

352
00:30:18,486 --> 00:30:22,234
<i>the dull cares that make up</i>
<i>your day-to-day existence,</i>

353
00:30:22,406 --> 00:30:25,407
<i>the little worries, the uncertainties,</i>

354
00:30:25,576 --> 00:30:28,696
<i>the confusions</i>
<i>of the workaday world?</i>

355
00:30:28,871 --> 00:30:33,248
<i>Follow me where pagan spirits</i>
<i>hold sway,</i>

356
00:30:33,417 --> 00:30:37,664
<i>where lithe natives dance</i>
<i>on a moon-enchanted isle,</i>

357
00:30:37,838 --> 00:30:42,002
<i>where palm trees sway</i>
<i>with the restless ocean tide.</i>

358
00:30:42,176 --> 00:30:48,095
<i>Restless, surging on the white shore.</i>
<i>Won't you come along?</i>

359
00:30:52,019 --> 00:30:55,934
<i>But remember... it's taboo.</i>

360
00:31:11,622 --> 00:31:13,781
I hope we're not disturbing her.

361
00:31:15,584 --> 00:31:18,704
I didn't hear you come in,
I was half asleep.

362
00:31:18,879 --> 00:31:22,295
I brought Turk home
to pose for me. In there.

363
00:31:23,217 --> 00:31:26,337
- Pose?
- For my poster for the spring relays.

364
00:31:26,512 --> 00:31:31,091
I have to do it for life class.
I had to grab him when I could.

365
00:31:31,267 --> 00:31:33,805
Lucky I got my track pants on.

366
00:31:33,978 --> 00:31:38,141
- What's he gonna do?
- Strip. Down to like this.

367
00:31:38,315 --> 00:31:41,352
I thought you meant
he was gonna pose naked.

368
00:31:41,527 --> 00:31:43,603
Men models seldom do.

369
00:31:43,779 --> 00:31:47,611
- Is Turk a model?
- Lots of college athletes pose for us.

370
00:31:47,783 --> 00:31:50,321
They like to be stared at, I guess.

371
00:31:54,665 --> 00:31:57,785
The women pose naked
and the men don't?

372
00:31:57,960 --> 00:32:00,036
Men are more proper.

373
00:32:00,212 --> 00:32:03,795
If it's all right for a woman,
it oughta be for a man.

374
00:32:03,966 --> 00:32:06,920
The man always
keeps covered. Ready?

375
00:32:07,094 --> 00:32:09,585
- Is this all right?
- Over here, please.

376
00:32:09,764 --> 00:32:12,219
It'll be tough not holding a javelin.

377
00:32:12,391 --> 00:32:14,514
- What about the broom?
- I'll manage.

378
00:32:14,685 --> 00:32:17,852
- It'll be just the thing.
- Is she always around?

379
00:32:18,022 --> 00:32:21,391
She's not so bad.
Look, I want your left foot here.

380
00:32:21,567 --> 00:32:25,150
- I'd rather have you pose for me.
- Ain't that good, Marie?

381
00:32:25,321 --> 00:32:28,026
- That's fine.
- Nice of you to trouble yourself.

382
00:32:28,199 --> 00:32:30,275
I'm glad to help.

383
00:32:34,663 --> 00:32:36,905
What about a little music?

384
00:32:49,637 --> 00:32:52,128
That's nice, Marie.

385
00:32:52,306 --> 00:32:57,052
That's real artistic. I wish I was artistic.

386
00:33:08,572 --> 00:33:11,490
I'll get you something cold to drink.

387
00:33:11,659 --> 00:33:15,075
- She makes me feel undressed.
- Aren't you?

388
00:33:15,246 --> 00:33:19,457
- Ain't she seen a man before?
- Not a big, beautiful man like you.

389
00:33:19,625 --> 00:33:22,745
You know, you're gonna
get yourself into trouble.

390
00:33:22,920 --> 00:33:24,498
Get back.

391
00:33:24,672 --> 00:33:26,748
Hello, Dr Delaney.

392
00:33:27,800 --> 00:33:30,552
You know Turk Fisher, a classmate.

393
00:33:30,720 --> 00:33:32,796
- Hello, Daddy.
- Hiya, Doc, what's up?

394
00:33:32,972 --> 00:33:37,183
- Marie's doing a drawing.
- I'm entering the poster competition.

395
00:33:37,351 --> 00:33:40,388
Lunch ain't ready,
but it won't take a minute.

396
00:33:40,563 --> 00:33:42,970
Here. Make yourselves at home.

397
00:33:44,692 --> 00:33:47,064
Cottage cheese and buttermilk.

398
00:33:47,236 --> 00:33:49,312
- How does that sound?
- Fine.

399
00:33:52,366 --> 00:33:54,738
What happened to his clothes?

400
00:33:54,910 --> 00:33:58,908
Marie's doing a drawing
for her life class, Daddy.

401
00:33:59,081 --> 00:34:01,751
Why doesn't she draw him
in his clothes?

402
00:34:01,917 --> 00:34:05,500
It's not the same, Doc.
You see, this is a life class.

403
00:34:05,671 --> 00:34:07,747
They just draw bodies.

404
00:34:07,923 --> 00:34:10,331
They all do it in the classroom.

405
00:34:10,509 --> 00:34:14,128
It's not right. I don't care
if they do teach it at college.

406
00:34:14,305 --> 00:34:16,594
Marie shouldn't do things like that.

407
00:34:16,766 --> 00:34:21,593
But he's just posing for her.
Marie says lots of the athletes do it.

408
00:34:21,771 --> 00:34:26,516
They fuss because they haven't
any children. They had one who died.

409
00:34:28,611 --> 00:34:31,481
I can think of more interesting subjects
than them.

410
00:34:31,655 --> 00:34:34,859
- You asked.
- I just meant he didn't care for me.

411
00:34:35,034 --> 00:34:39,862
Doc is sort of tense. He used to be sick.
And getting old is no fun, I guess.

412
00:34:40,039 --> 00:34:42,364
Yeah. Our age is the time.

413
00:34:42,541 --> 00:34:45,708
- You said it.
- We don't want to waste any of it.

414
00:34:45,878 --> 00:34:49,164
Turk, just hold that pose.
I'm almost finished.

415
00:34:49,340 --> 00:34:53,669
Why doesn't she draw something else?
Flowers, a cathedral, a sunset?

416
00:34:53,844 --> 00:34:57,972
All I know is Marie says if she does
a good drawing of Turk,

417
00:34:58,140 --> 00:35:01,675
they'll use it for the posters
in the spring relays.

418
00:35:01,852 --> 00:35:04,604
So I guess they don't want sunsets.

419
00:35:06,315 --> 00:35:10,183
Suppose somebody walked in.
What would they think?

420
00:35:10,361 --> 00:35:15,568
Well, if you think it's wrong, Daddy,
I won't let them do it again.

421
00:35:15,741 --> 00:35:18,778
- I just don't like it.
- I don't see any harm in it.

422
00:35:18,953 --> 00:35:23,330
- No harm? She's engaged, isn't she?
- Well, it ain't set yet.

423
00:35:24,375 --> 00:35:28,538
All right. If anything happens
to that girl, I'll never forgive you.

424
00:35:45,021 --> 00:35:47,476
- Mrs Delaney.
- Who cares about her?

425
00:36:17,678 --> 00:36:21,593
- I'll get it.
- Yes, it's probably for you, Daddy.

426
00:36:25,227 --> 00:36:27,718
Hello? I'll call her.

427
00:36:27,897 --> 00:36:30,898
- Who is it?
- It's for Marie.

428
00:36:31,067 --> 00:36:33,984
- Yeah, but who is it?
- Marie, telephone.

429
00:36:34,153 --> 00:36:36,229
Thanks.

430
00:36:37,281 --> 00:36:39,357
Hello? Oh, hi.

431
00:36:39,533 --> 00:36:43,697
Aren't we the big shot now?
Nice record you chalked up today.

432
00:36:43,871 --> 00:36:47,370
- Turk was the star of the track meet.
- Oh, Turk!

433
00:36:47,541 --> 00:36:51,124
I'm getting ready now. I'll be waiting.
OK.

434
00:36:52,171 --> 00:36:55,505
- Where you going?
- Dance and whatnot.

435
00:37:01,889 --> 00:37:04,760
I used to be popular, wasn't I, Doc?

436
00:37:24,245 --> 00:37:26,818
Remember the homecoming dance,

437
00:37:26,997 --> 00:37:30,698
when Charlie Kettlecamp and I
won the charleston contest?

438
00:37:32,753 --> 00:37:37,131
Remember how mad you was when
he thought he ought to bring me home?

439
00:37:37,299 --> 00:37:40,668
- I did not get mad.
- Oh, yes, you did.

440
00:37:43,764 --> 00:37:47,347
Charlie was all right.
You was just jealous.

441
00:37:49,186 --> 00:37:52,353
- I was not jealous.
- Yes, you were, Doc.

442
00:37:52,523 --> 00:37:57,268
You got jealous when we went anyplace
if I even looked at another boy.

443
00:37:57,445 --> 00:38:01,277
There was nothing between Charlie
and me. There never was.

444
00:38:01,449 --> 00:38:03,774
Honey, I'm trying to read.

445
00:38:09,498 --> 00:38:12,618
Are you hungry? Hungry?

446
00:38:18,674 --> 00:38:21,841
Lots of other boys
called me up for dates.

447
00:38:22,011 --> 00:38:24,087
Sammy Knight.

448
00:38:25,348 --> 00:38:27,424
Hank Biederman.

449
00:38:29,518 --> 00:38:32,970
- Dutch McCoy.
- Sure, baby, you were the It girl.

450
00:38:33,147 --> 00:38:36,563
But I saved all my dates for you,
didn't I, Daddy?

451
00:38:36,734 --> 00:38:39,901
- As far as I know.
- Doc, I did.

452
00:38:40,071 --> 00:38:44,282
You know I did. I never had a date
with any other boy but you.

453
00:38:44,450 --> 00:38:47,404
That was a long time ago.
It's all forgotten.

454
00:38:47,578 --> 00:38:52,406
Doc, how can you say that? Those were
the happiest times of our lives.

455
00:38:52,583 --> 00:38:54,659
I'll never forget them.

456
00:38:54,835 --> 00:38:57,161
I'll never forget that spring.

457
00:38:57,338 --> 00:39:02,000
It was such a nice spring.
The trees were so full and so green.

458
00:39:02,176 --> 00:39:04,797
And the air smelled so sweet.

459
00:39:06,555 --> 00:39:10,256
Remember the walks we took
down by the old chapel?

460
00:39:10,434 --> 00:39:12,806
It was so quiet and still.

461
00:39:13,979 --> 00:39:16,649
That was such a nice spring.

462
00:39:17,692 --> 00:39:21,310
In spring, a young man's fancy turns...
pretty fancy.

463
00:39:22,488 --> 00:39:25,405
I was pretty then, wasn't I, Doc?

464
00:39:26,450 --> 00:39:29,321
Remember the first time
you kissed me?

465
00:39:29,495 --> 00:39:33,409
You were scared as a young girl.
You trembled so.

466
00:39:34,458 --> 00:39:37,329
We'd been going together
almost a year.

467
00:39:37,503 --> 00:39:40,041
And you'd always been so shy.

468
00:39:40,214 --> 00:39:44,378
That night, for the first time,
you grabbed me and kissed me.

469
00:39:45,803 --> 00:39:48,720
There was tears in your eyes, Doc.

470
00:39:48,889 --> 00:39:52,673
You said you'd love me
forever and ever. Remember?

471
00:39:52,852 --> 00:39:56,636
You said if I didn't marry you,
you just wanted to die.

472
00:39:56,814 --> 00:40:01,690
I remember because it scared me
to have anybody say anything like that.

473
00:40:01,861 --> 00:40:03,937
Yes, baby.

474
00:40:04,989 --> 00:40:09,450
Then, when it got dark,
we stretched out on the cool grass.

475
00:40:10,953 --> 00:40:13,242
You kissed me all night long.

476
00:40:13,414 --> 00:40:17,459
You've got to forget those things.
It was 20 years ago.

477
00:40:19,128 --> 00:40:21,417
Those years have vanished.

478
00:40:24,675 --> 00:40:27,629
Just vanished into thin air.

479
00:40:30,931 --> 00:40:34,135
Maybe you're sorry
you married me now, Doc.

480
00:40:34,310 --> 00:40:38,058
You didn't know I was gonna
get old and fat and sloppy.

481
00:40:38,230 --> 00:40:42,477
- Oh, baby...
- It's the truth. That's what I am.

482
00:40:43,486 --> 00:40:48,278
But I didn't know it either.
Are you sorry you married me?

483
00:40:49,450 --> 00:40:54,278
- Of course not.
- Are you sorry you had to marry me?

484
00:40:55,873 --> 00:40:58,993
We were never gonna
talk about that, baby.

485
00:41:04,131 --> 00:41:07,915
But, Doc... you was the only one.

486
00:41:09,261 --> 00:41:12,927
- I'd just die if you didn't believe that.
- I know.

487
00:41:13,099 --> 00:41:15,175
You were so nice and proper,

488
00:41:15,351 --> 00:41:20,428
I never thought anything we did together
would be wrong or make us unhappy.

489
00:41:20,606 --> 00:41:22,895
Do you think we did wrong?

490
00:41:23,734 --> 00:41:27,186
You can't defy convention.
Or the laws of God.

491
00:41:27,363 --> 00:41:31,028
I don't think anybody ever knew
except my folks.

492
00:41:33,035 --> 00:41:37,365
If the baby had lived,
everyone would have known.

493
00:41:37,540 --> 00:41:42,498
My losing her, the way it turned out,
you wouldn't have had to marry me.

494
00:41:42,670 --> 00:41:45,375
Honey, what's done is done.

495
00:41:45,548 --> 00:41:47,790
But it must make you feel bad

496
00:41:47,967 --> 00:41:52,214
to think you had to give up your studies
and support a wife.

497
00:41:52,388 --> 00:41:55,140
You might have been a real MD today.

498
00:41:59,812 --> 00:42:03,181
- Marie, don't keep me waiting.
- Will I need a coat?

499
00:42:03,357 --> 00:42:05,599
No, you got me.

500
00:42:20,916 --> 00:42:24,167
If the baby'd lived,
she'd be just like Marie.

501
00:42:25,379 --> 00:42:28,380
We'd be watching her go on dates.

502
00:42:29,342 --> 00:42:33,505
Lola, people have got to forget the past
and live for the present.

503
00:42:33,679 --> 00:42:36,301
We all make mistakes.

504
00:42:36,474 --> 00:42:39,309
When my family left me all that money,

505
00:42:39,477 --> 00:42:43,889
I could have gone back and finished,
instead of drinking it all up.

506
00:42:44,065 --> 00:42:47,897
We could have had a nice house,
friends, comforts.

507
00:42:49,445 --> 00:42:53,858
Maybe we could have adopted a family,
since you couldn't have any more.

508
00:42:54,033 --> 00:42:57,698
We don't have any of those things.
So what?

509
00:42:57,870 --> 00:42:59,946
We gotta keep living, don't we?

510
00:43:00,122 --> 00:43:04,334
I can't give up just because I made
a few mistakes, I gotta keep going.

511
00:43:05,378 --> 00:43:08,248
Sure, Doc. I know.

512
00:43:14,095 --> 00:43:16,171
I'd better get ready.

513
00:43:18,140 --> 00:43:21,307
I'll walk down to the corner
with you, Daddy.

514
00:43:23,521 --> 00:43:25,597
Ed Anderson's picking me up.

515
00:43:25,773 --> 00:43:27,931
Are you gonna be late tonight?

516
00:43:28,109 --> 00:43:32,735
I don't know. Saturday's a bad night
at the hospital. Don't wait up for me.

517
00:43:42,206 --> 00:43:44,958
- Take it easy.
- Hi, Doc.

518
00:44:03,436 --> 00:44:05,677
Little Sheba.

519
00:44:06,939 --> 00:44:10,142
Come, Little Sheba, come back.

520
00:44:11,819 --> 00:44:14,227
Come back, Little Sheba.

521
00:44:17,241 --> 00:44:19,447
I remember being taken to this hospital

522
00:44:19,618 --> 00:44:22,904
in a padded limousine and a straitjacket.

523
00:44:23,080 --> 00:44:25,452
I should think you'd try to forget it.

524
00:44:25,624 --> 00:44:29,040
If you talk about it enough,
you do forget, so they tell me.

525
00:44:29,211 --> 00:44:31,999
No good burying it or being ashamed.

526
00:44:32,173 --> 00:44:36,040
I'm going in under my own steam now,
that's what's important.

527
00:44:36,218 --> 00:44:38,888
I was never violent. I had quiet DTs.

528
00:44:39,055 --> 00:44:42,470
The noises were made by
the caterpillars on the wall

529
00:44:42,641 --> 00:44:45,892
while I waited
for them to turn into butterflies.

530
00:45:02,703 --> 00:45:07,080
What's the matter, Doc?
It's no picnic, but you get used to it.

531
00:45:18,260 --> 00:45:20,716
- Looks like we're having company.
- Yeah.

532
00:45:20,888 --> 00:45:25,680
Bruce is coming tomorrow night.
I'm gonna ask him to dinner.

533
00:45:25,851 --> 00:45:29,719
- Marie know about it?
- Yeah. She was real pleased.

534
00:45:29,897 --> 00:45:33,017
She said she thought it was
very thoughtful of me.

535
00:45:35,778 --> 00:45:39,277
Gotta take this polish back
to Mrs Coffman.

536
00:45:41,409 --> 00:45:45,406
- I'm pooped.
- Don't use that word, it sounds vulgar.

537
00:45:45,579 --> 00:45:49,411
I hear Marie say it all the time.
I thought it was cute.

538
00:45:49,583 --> 00:45:52,668
Marie doesn't say it,
her language is refined.

539
00:45:52,837 --> 00:45:57,048
Well, Turk, then. Somebody.

540
00:45:58,300 --> 00:46:01,337
- Marie studying?
- No, she went out.

541
00:46:01,512 --> 00:46:03,588
I didn't hear her.

542
00:46:12,898 --> 00:46:15,140
Let's get some peppy music.

543
00:46:22,908 --> 00:46:25,031
I love peppy music.

544
00:46:25,202 --> 00:46:29,152
I guess it's 'cause I used to be
such a good dancer. Wasn't I?

545
00:46:30,332 --> 00:46:34,116
- Doc, let's dance.
- Oh, no, dear.

546
00:46:34,295 --> 00:46:38,079
Come on, Daddy, you used to be
a good dancer.

547
00:46:47,475 --> 00:46:50,392
We oughta go dancing all the time, Doc.

548
00:46:50,561 --> 00:46:54,012
If we did, maybe I'd lose
some of this fat.

549
00:47:07,328 --> 00:47:12,405
I remember when I could dance like this
all night and never notice it.

550
00:47:16,087 --> 00:47:20,215
Remember the charleston?
That used to be my specialty.

551
00:47:30,935 --> 00:47:33,936
- Hey, not bad.
- The place is jumping.

552
00:47:37,316 --> 00:47:40,317
- You gonna study?
- If it's still all right.

553
00:47:40,486 --> 00:47:42,360
Oh, sure.

554
00:47:43,531 --> 00:47:48,905
Marie said she couldn't go out tonight,
so I said she could use the parlour.

555
00:47:49,078 --> 00:47:54,203
Turk's going to help with my chemistry.
Oh, you don't have to leave.

556
00:47:54,375 --> 00:47:57,625
- I have to go out anyway.
- Oh, you do?

557
00:47:57,795 --> 00:48:01,662
I have a meeting. I won't be late.
That's Marie's scarf.

558
00:48:01,841 --> 00:48:06,668
- I borrowed your scarf, honey.
- That's all right. Sit down, Turk.

559
00:48:06,846 --> 00:48:09,965
Sure is nice of you,
letting us take over like this.

560
00:48:10,141 --> 00:48:13,011
I gotta make hay
while she's still smiling at me.

561
00:48:13,185 --> 00:48:15,511
Make yourselves at home.

562
00:48:29,994 --> 00:48:33,944
- I wish they'd both go out.
- You don't sound much reformed.

563
00:48:34,123 --> 00:48:36,994
Well, you gave me the "go" signal.

564
00:48:37,168 --> 00:48:40,334
I know you women
gotta pretend to be offended.

565
00:48:40,504 --> 00:48:44,454
- But when you come back for more...
- I'll slap your face.

566
00:48:45,051 --> 00:48:47,542
Now, you gonna study or not?

567
00:48:50,181 --> 00:48:52,257
I am studying.

568
00:48:53,559 --> 00:48:58,221
- Is there anything wrong, Doc?
- If you don't know, I can't tell you.

569
00:48:59,273 --> 00:49:01,562
You like him, but he's no good.

570
00:49:01,734 --> 00:49:04,735
Marie's innocent, she doesn't
understand guys like him.

571
00:49:04,904 --> 00:49:09,316
- I ought to run him out of the house.
- You wouldn't do that.

572
00:49:10,785 --> 00:49:14,996
They always behave so nice, Doc.
I know, I watch them.

573
00:49:16,624 --> 00:49:22,045
- What do you mean, you watch them?
- Well, I let them use the parlour.

574
00:49:22,213 --> 00:49:24,086
You watch them?

575
00:49:24,256 --> 00:49:29,417
You watch young people making love
in the movies. That's not wrong.

576
00:49:29,595 --> 00:49:33,344
They're so sweet and nice,
why shouldn't I watch 'em?

577
00:49:33,516 --> 00:49:36,054
I think it's the sweetest time in life.

578
00:49:36,227 --> 00:49:38,634
Makes me feel young to watch 'em.

579
00:49:38,813 --> 00:49:40,971
He's too coarse for her.

580
00:49:41,148 --> 00:49:45,360
Why don't you talk to her, Daddy,
talk to her like a father?

581
00:49:45,528 --> 00:49:47,900
- I couldn't do that.
- It'll be all right.

582
00:49:48,072 --> 00:49:52,449
Bruce will be here soon
and Turk won't be around any more.

583
00:49:53,953 --> 00:49:55,780
Night, Daddy.

584
00:50:02,336 --> 00:50:05,586
- Have a nice evening, Dr Delaney.
- Thanks.

585
00:50:11,637 --> 00:50:13,879
- He hates my guts.
- He does not.

586
00:50:14,056 --> 00:50:17,757
- He does. If you ask me, he's jealous.
- Jealous?

587
00:50:17,935 --> 00:50:20,426
Yeah, I think he has a crush on you.

588
00:50:20,604 --> 00:50:23,274
Turk, don't be silly. Doc's nice to me.

589
00:50:23,441 --> 00:50:28,233
It's just little things he does, like fixing
my breakfast. He's nice to everyone.

590
00:50:28,404 --> 00:50:31,939
- He ever make a pass?
- No, Doc'd never get fresh.

591
00:50:32,116 --> 00:50:35,152
- He'd better not.
- Turk, don't be ridiculous.

592
00:50:35,327 --> 00:50:37,404
Doc's a real nice, quiet man.

593
00:50:37,580 --> 00:50:41,494
If he likes running his fingers
through my hair, well, why not?

594
00:50:41,667 --> 00:50:44,953
He's got a wife of his own.
Let him make passes at her.

595
00:50:45,129 --> 00:50:47,798
Things like that
are none of our business.

596
00:50:47,965 --> 00:50:50,124
OK, how about a snuggle?

597
00:50:50,301 --> 00:50:53,421
- Not tonight.
- Why is tonight different?

598
00:50:53,596 --> 00:50:58,092
We should make it a rule
every once in a while to just sit and talk.

599
00:51:03,939 --> 00:51:06,015
OK.

600
00:51:10,780 --> 00:51:12,856
What'll we talk about?

601
00:51:13,032 --> 00:51:15,570
- There's lots of things.
- OK, start in.

602
00:51:15,743 --> 00:51:18,660
A person doesn't start
a conversation that way.

603
00:51:18,829 --> 00:51:21,071
Start it any way you want to.

604
00:51:21,248 --> 00:51:26,124
Two people should have something
to talk about, like... philosophy

605
00:51:26,295 --> 00:51:29,082
or politics, religion.

606
00:51:29,256 --> 00:51:31,332
- How about sex?
- Turk!

607
00:51:32,385 --> 00:51:37,130
You wanted to talk about something.
I was trying to please. Let's have a kiss.

608
00:51:37,306 --> 00:51:39,880
- Not tonight.
- Who are you saving it for?

609
00:51:40,059 --> 00:51:45,017
- Don't talk like that.
- Well, thanks for a nice evening.

610
00:51:45,189 --> 00:51:48,356
- Where are you going?
- I'm a man of action, baby.

611
00:51:48,526 --> 00:51:52,025
- Don't go.
- Why not? I'm not doing any good here.

612
00:51:54,281 --> 00:51:56,357
Don't go.

613
00:51:59,078 --> 00:52:02,494
Why didn't you think about this before?
Come on.

614
00:52:02,665 --> 00:52:05,785
- Let's get to work.
- This is all we ever do.

615
00:52:05,960 --> 00:52:08,747
- Are you complaining?
- No.

616
00:52:08,921 --> 00:52:12,171
- Then why put up such a front?
- It's not a front.

617
00:52:12,341 --> 00:52:15,508
What else is it?
"Oh, no, Turk. Not tonight, Turk.

618
00:52:15,678 --> 00:52:18,216
"I wanna talk about philosophy, Turk."

619
00:52:18,389 --> 00:52:21,805
If I went out of here without trying,
you'd be sore.

620
00:52:21,976 --> 00:52:24,265
- Oh, Turk.
- It's true.

621
00:52:24,437 --> 00:52:28,055
- Maybe.
- How about tonight, baby?

622
00:52:28,232 --> 00:52:30,853
- What about Mrs Delaney?
- What about her?

623
00:52:31,027 --> 00:52:35,605
- Women sense those things.
- She ever say anything?

624
00:52:35,781 --> 00:52:38,355
- No.
- You're imagining things.

625
00:52:38,534 --> 00:52:40,610
- Maybe.
- Stop it.

626
00:52:44,290 --> 00:52:46,448
I know I treat you kind of rough.

627
00:52:46,625 --> 00:52:51,501
I never was very gentlemanly, but...
you really don't mind it, do you?

628
00:52:51,672 --> 00:52:54,792
- You know I'm nuts about you.
- Are you?

629
00:52:57,345 --> 00:52:59,717
Miss Buckholder, what's your opinion

630
00:52:59,889 --> 00:53:03,471
of the psychodynamic pressure
of living in the atomic age?

631
00:53:03,642 --> 00:53:06,050
Turk, don't make fun of me.

632
00:53:47,603 --> 00:53:49,263
Tonight?

633
00:53:49,438 --> 00:53:51,894
OK.

634
00:53:58,280 --> 00:54:03,737
Let's go and have a few beers.
Come back here when they're asleep.

635
00:54:30,187 --> 00:54:32,857
You're wearing me down.

636
00:54:36,027 --> 00:54:40,190
- Who are you showing off for?
- That blonde. She's drooling at me.

637
00:54:40,364 --> 00:54:43,531
If I didn't know you so well
I might drool, too.

638
00:54:49,874 --> 00:54:51,950
What time is it, d'you think?

639
00:54:52,126 --> 00:54:54,582
Time for the old folks to be in bed.

640
00:54:59,258 --> 00:55:03,885
- Come on, let's get going.
- You're awfully fresh.

641
00:55:49,975 --> 00:55:52,052
Why here, half a block away?

642
00:55:52,228 --> 00:55:56,178
I might be leaving late.
No sense in waking the Delaneys.

643
00:56:20,631 --> 00:56:24,795
- I forgot my key.
- That's a good excuse. Let me see.

644
00:56:25,845 --> 00:56:27,921
Turk, stop it.

645
00:56:29,056 --> 00:56:32,888
OK, we'll both stay out here, then.
Suits me.

646
00:56:35,521 --> 00:56:39,222
- No comfy porch swing?
- You're becoming a nuisance.

647
00:56:39,400 --> 00:56:43,647
Since when have I changed?
You recognised my type at first glance.

648
00:56:43,821 --> 00:56:47,439
- Let me see your key.
- Go ahead, look.

649
00:56:51,662 --> 00:56:53,738
I told you I didn't have it.

650
00:56:59,587 --> 00:57:01,663
Don't you dare.

651
00:57:10,806 --> 00:57:15,682
"Come in," said the spider to the fly.
You'd look cute, climbing in windows.

652
00:57:24,612 --> 00:57:28,656
- Isn't it fun doing things you shouldn't?
- Not here.

653
00:57:28,824 --> 00:57:32,952
Cut the conversation.
You want somebody to hear us?

654
00:58:02,733 --> 00:58:06,897
The Delaneys'll hear us.
Give a girl a chance to breathe.

655
00:58:09,198 --> 00:58:12,781
- Who's the guy?
- Bruce. He wants to marry me.

656
00:58:12,952 --> 00:58:16,072
- Can he kiss like I can?
- Better. He's perfect.

657
00:58:16,247 --> 00:58:20,031
- He's in love with me.
- So he's there and I'm here.

658
00:58:22,503 --> 00:58:26,667
- He'll be here tomorrow.
- What are you trying to pull?

659
00:58:26,841 --> 00:58:31,218
You dames are always playing
one of us against the other.

660
00:58:31,387 --> 00:58:33,463
I don't want to fight.

661
00:58:36,559 --> 00:58:38,682
Turk, I won't!

662
00:58:42,481 --> 00:58:46,431
OK. But don't you come teasing
around me any more.

663
01:01:40,701 --> 01:01:44,035
Marie? Will you help me
move the table?

664
01:01:44,205 --> 01:01:46,281
Oh, sure.

665
01:01:47,333 --> 01:01:49,705
We have more room this way.

666
01:01:51,462 --> 01:01:53,538
Little early to be doing this.

667
01:01:53,714 --> 01:01:55,790
I like to set the table early

668
01:01:55,966 --> 01:01:59,964
and spend the rest of the day
looking at it. Oh, the cups.

669
01:02:00,137 --> 01:02:02,463
- You feeling better?
- Fine.

670
01:02:02,640 --> 01:02:04,716
That's good.

671
01:02:05,768 --> 01:02:08,888
Marie, d'you know what
I'm gonna have for dinner?

672
01:02:09,063 --> 01:02:12,396
- No, what?
- I was awake half the night planning it.

673
01:02:12,566 --> 01:02:16,516
We're gonna have stuffed pork chops,
twice-baked potatoes

674
01:02:16,696 --> 01:02:18,772
and a big chocolate cake.

675
01:02:18,948 --> 01:02:21,818
- And tomato juice.
- Sounds perfect.

676
01:02:21,992 --> 01:02:25,243
Look at this tablecloth. Irish linen.

677
01:02:25,413 --> 01:02:27,785
Doc's mother gave it to us.

678
01:02:27,957 --> 01:02:30,911
- It's lovely.
- The china's real Haviland.

679
01:02:31,085 --> 01:02:33,161
- Beautiful.
- Doc's awful proud of it.

680
01:02:33,337 --> 01:02:36,422
- Anything his mother gave him.
- A real mama's boy.

681
01:02:36,590 --> 01:02:40,802
He was the only child and she thought
the sun rose and set in him.

682
01:02:40,970 --> 01:02:45,466
- What were your parents like?
- My father was awful strict.

683
01:02:45,641 --> 01:02:49,853
He didn't let me go out with boys,
on account of I was so pretty.

684
01:02:50,021 --> 01:02:53,140
Once, he caught me holding hands
with Dutch McCoy.

685
01:02:53,315 --> 01:02:56,103
He wouldn't let me out for a month.

686
01:02:56,277 --> 01:03:00,737
- He didn't even want me to marry Doc.
- Why? Doc's such a gentleman.

687
01:03:00,906 --> 01:03:06,245
My dad was just... Well, I guess it was
because I was so young.

688
01:03:06,412 --> 01:03:10,492
Doc and I moved to the city
and I never went back again.

689
01:03:10,666 --> 01:03:13,453
But my mother comes to see me.

690
01:03:13,627 --> 01:03:16,996
- I have to get to class.
- Where's the baking soda?

691
01:03:17,173 --> 01:03:19,960
- Just a minute.
- I'll get it for him.

692
01:03:21,594 --> 01:03:24,049
I'm sorry you don't feel good.

693
01:03:26,474 --> 01:03:28,762
- I'll fix it.
- No, it's no bother.

694
01:03:28,934 --> 01:03:31,010
I'm glad to do it for you.

695
01:03:36,859 --> 01:03:38,935
There, that'll perk you up.

696
01:04:45,177 --> 01:04:47,965
- Oh. You going so soon, Doc?
- Yes.

697
01:04:48,139 --> 01:04:50,677
Aren't you gonna kiss me goodbye?

698
01:04:51,726 --> 01:04:55,806
Get home early, we want to
give Bruce a royal welcome.

699
01:04:55,980 --> 01:05:00,357
- You feeling all right?
- Doc, I'll walk to the corner with you.

700
01:05:00,526 --> 01:05:04,358
- I'm late.
- Bye, Daddy.

701
01:05:09,201 --> 01:05:13,662
That's funny. I wonder why
Doc took his raincoat.

702
01:05:13,831 --> 01:05:15,907
It's a beautiful day.

703
01:05:16,083 --> 01:05:18,574
There isn't a cloud in sight.

704
01:05:26,135 --> 01:05:30,263
I've never seen such activity.
What got into you?

705
01:05:30,431 --> 01:05:34,808
Company's coming. Look at your lilacs,
don't they look nice?

706
01:05:34,977 --> 01:05:40,517
Beautiful. My, and you did your
spring house-cleaning all in one day.

707
01:05:41,567 --> 01:05:44,023
I certainly have to hand it to you.

708
01:05:44,195 --> 01:05:48,358
All these years, I've said to myself,
"Mrs Delaney is a good-for-nothing.

709
01:05:48,532 --> 01:05:52,696
"Sits around the house all day,
never even shakes a dust mop."

710
01:05:52,870 --> 01:05:56,702
It just goes to show
you can never tell about people.

711
01:05:56,874 --> 01:05:59,116
- Candy?
- Thank you, no.

712
01:06:00,169 --> 01:06:04,582
- Your dinner smells good.
- Pork chops and twice-baked potatoes.

713
01:06:04,757 --> 01:06:07,758
That reminds me,
my kids must be hungry.

714
01:06:08,803 --> 01:06:11,128
- Nice.
- Doc's favourite.

715
01:06:12,682 --> 01:06:17,059
I forgot to return your silver polish.
Thanks for lending it to me.

716
01:06:17,228 --> 01:06:20,015
- Have a nice evening.
- Thanks.

717
01:06:20,189 --> 01:06:22,265
- Night.
- Good night.

718
01:06:22,441 --> 01:06:24,730
Mrs Delaney?

719
01:06:27,697 --> 01:06:29,773
Mrs Delaney.

720
01:06:29,949 --> 01:06:32,404
- Yeah?
- Would you help me?

721
01:06:32,576 --> 01:06:37,488
You and Doc won't mind if we eat and
run? Bruce will want to take me out.

722
01:06:37,665 --> 01:06:40,998
That's all right, honey.
We understand perfectly.

723
01:06:41,168 --> 01:06:44,703
- Thanks a lot.
- That's a beautiful dress.

724
01:06:44,880 --> 01:06:48,166
- You never wore that before.
- I know my man.

725
01:06:48,342 --> 01:06:52,885
- Are you gonna marry Bruce?
- I am. I made up my mind last night.

726
01:06:53,055 --> 01:06:56,887
- I feel kinda sorry for Turk.
- He may be sore for a while.

727
01:06:57,059 --> 01:07:01,389
- But he has other girls. He'll get over it.
- Won't he feel bad?

728
01:07:01,564 --> 01:07:06,142
He's had his eye on a pretty girl
in his history class for a long time.

729
01:07:06,318 --> 01:07:10,482
- He's just not the marrying kind.
- Oh. Really?

730
01:07:11,866 --> 01:07:13,739
Oh, Bruce!

731
01:07:13,909 --> 01:07:17,444
- You want me to open the door?
- I'll get it.

732
01:07:25,212 --> 01:07:28,664
- Can't you get out of it?
- Not without hurting her feelings.

733
01:07:28,841 --> 01:07:31,877
If we have to eat with them,
I'd rather take them out.

734
01:07:32,053 --> 01:07:35,635
- And not be able to get rid of them?
- Who's clever now?

735
01:07:37,641 --> 01:07:39,718
Hello there.

736
01:07:39,894 --> 01:07:42,930
Mrs Delaney, this is Bruce. Finally.

737
01:07:43,105 --> 01:07:45,561
- How do you do?
- How do you do?

738
01:07:45,733 --> 01:07:51,771
Marie was so excited about
your coming. I bet you're hungry.

739
01:07:51,947 --> 01:07:55,198
Marie says very nice things
about you in her letters.

740
01:07:55,368 --> 01:07:57,325
Go right in, honey.

741
01:07:57,495 --> 01:08:00,199
Mrs Delaney has fixed
the grandest dinner.

742
01:08:00,373 --> 01:08:04,666
That was to be my treat. I thought we
could all go to my hotel and celebrate.

743
01:08:04,835 --> 01:08:08,880
- Have a few cocktails.
- We can have cocktails here.

744
01:08:09,048 --> 01:08:12,381
- I'll get them.
- She even cleaned the house for you.

745
01:08:57,346 --> 01:08:59,422
- Marie.
- Yes?

746
01:08:59,598 --> 01:09:02,516
We'll have to go ahead without Doc.

747
01:09:02,685 --> 01:09:07,394
- What's the matter with Doc?
- He got held up at the office.

748
01:09:07,565 --> 01:09:10,566
It would be when I needed him most.

749
01:09:10,735 --> 01:09:13,854
- Sure you don't need help?
- No, everything's ready.

750
01:09:14,030 --> 01:09:18,158
- Marie, you sit here, honey.
- Thank you.

751
01:09:18,325 --> 01:09:21,860
- Bruce, will you sit here?
- Thank you.

752
01:09:22,038 --> 01:09:25,620
Three's a crowd, so I'm just gonna
serve you lovebirds.

753
01:09:25,791 --> 01:09:27,867
- There's no hurry.
- Oh, sure.

754
01:09:28,044 --> 01:09:30,665
Gotta start, 'cause the food will all spoil.

755
01:09:30,838 --> 01:09:32,914
Let's have some candles.

756
01:09:33,090 --> 01:09:35,628
- Let me do that.
- Thanks, Bruce.

757
01:09:35,801 --> 01:09:38,719
I always think candlelight's so romantic.

758
01:09:40,765 --> 01:09:44,299
If you'll just excuse me.
Just a minute.

759
01:09:54,195 --> 01:09:56,271
Hello.

760
01:09:56,447 --> 01:10:00,148
Oh, Ed. Have you seen Doc?

761
01:10:01,535 --> 01:10:04,785
He went out this morning
and he isn't home yet.

762
01:10:04,955 --> 01:10:07,743
We're having company for dinner.

763
01:10:09,210 --> 01:10:14,002
No, but you know that bottle of whisky
we had in the kitchen all this time?

764
01:10:14,173 --> 01:10:16,462
Well, Doc's never gone near it.

765
01:10:16,634 --> 01:10:19,754
I was gonna make drinks
for the company

766
01:10:19,929 --> 01:10:22,384
and I went to get it and it was gone.

767
01:10:24,350 --> 01:10:27,055
No. I don't think so.

768
01:10:29,563 --> 01:10:34,439
Oh. He said this morning
his stomach was kind of upset.

769
01:10:36,112 --> 01:10:38,353
Would... would you, Ed?

770
01:10:38,531 --> 01:10:40,938
Thanks, Ed. Thanks a million times.

771
01:10:42,034 --> 01:10:44,110
Yes, I'll be here.

772
01:11:06,058 --> 01:11:11,301
I'm afraid it's a little late for cocktails.
But tomato juice is real good for you.

773
01:11:11,480 --> 01:11:14,315
I'm high already, getting my girl back.

774
01:11:14,483 --> 01:11:18,267
- Sure you won't eat with us?
- I'm not a bit hungry.

775
01:11:18,446 --> 01:11:20,522
Well...

776
01:11:22,324 --> 01:11:25,325
What about a little music?

777
01:12:57,169 --> 01:13:00,455
Oh, Ed, it's Mrs Delaney again.

778
01:13:01,507 --> 01:13:04,508
I hated to call so early, but I just had to.

779
01:13:04,677 --> 01:13:06,753
Did you find Doc?

780
01:13:08,139 --> 01:13:10,464
No. No, he hasn't.

781
01:13:11,892 --> 01:13:17,100
He probably won't come home until he's
had all he can drink and wants to sleep.

782
01:13:19,900 --> 01:13:23,104
I don't know what else
to think, Ed. I'm scared.

783
01:13:24,989 --> 01:13:27,065
I'm awfully scared.

784
01:13:28,451 --> 01:13:31,654
If I need you later on,
will you come over?

785
01:13:34,290 --> 01:13:36,366
Thanks.

786
01:15:30,156 --> 01:15:31,650
Doc!

787
01:15:36,078 --> 01:15:39,115
Are you all right, Daddy?

788
01:15:40,750 --> 01:15:44,165
Where's the morning paper?
I want to see the paper.

789
01:15:44,337 --> 01:15:48,204
We don't get any morning paper,
you know that.

790
01:15:48,841 --> 01:15:52,542
Then I suppose I'm drunk.
Is that what you're trying to say?

791
01:15:52,720 --> 01:15:55,970
- No, Daddy.
- Then get me the morning paper.

792
01:15:56,140 --> 01:15:58,216
Sure, Doc.

793
01:16:01,020 --> 01:16:03,178
Here we are.

794
01:16:03,356 --> 01:16:08,812
- Now, you sit right there and be quiet.
- Why shouldn't I be quiet?

795
01:16:08,986 --> 01:16:11,904
- Nothing, Doc.
- "Nothing, Doc."

796
01:16:13,824 --> 01:16:18,985
- Doc? You're sure you're all right?
- Course I'm all right.

797
01:16:22,124 --> 01:16:24,247
Doc, where've you been?

798
01:16:26,170 --> 01:16:29,835
What business is it of yours
where I've been?

799
01:16:32,009 --> 01:16:35,627
- Daddy, I...
- Just let me alone, that's all I ask.

800
01:16:42,895 --> 01:16:46,015
Why did you do it?
You said you'd be home early

801
01:16:46,190 --> 01:16:49,808
and I had a nice dinner fixed
for Bruce and you never came.

802
01:16:49,985 --> 01:16:55,360
- Bruce. A big dinner for Bruce.
- But it was for you, too.

803
01:16:55,533 --> 01:16:58,902
- Well, I don't want it.
- Daddy, don't get mad.

804
01:17:02,039 --> 01:17:04,162
Where's Marie?

805
01:17:05,918 --> 01:17:10,960
I don't know. She didn't come home
last night. She went out with Bruce.

806
01:17:11,132 --> 01:17:15,295
I suppose you peeked through
the keyhole and applauded.

807
01:17:15,469 --> 01:17:20,546
Daddy, don't say things like that. He's
a nice boy. They're going to be married.

808
01:17:20,725 --> 01:17:22,801
Probably has to marry her.

809
01:17:22,977 --> 01:17:26,310
Just 'cause she's pretty
and he got amorous one day.

810
01:17:27,565 --> 01:17:30,020
- Like I had to marry you.
- Don't, Daddy.

811
01:17:30,192 --> 01:17:32,683
You and Marie are a couple of sluts.

812
01:17:32,862 --> 01:17:37,571
- Daddy, please don't talk like that.
- What are you good for?

813
01:17:37,742 --> 01:17:42,035
- You can't even cook my breakfast.
- I will, Doc, I will.

814
01:17:42,204 --> 01:17:47,116
You don't sweep the floors till some
bozo comes and makes love to Marie.

815
01:17:47,293 --> 01:17:50,709
Then you fix things up like...
like Buckingham Palace.

816
01:17:52,715 --> 01:17:56,713
Or a Chinese joint,
with perfume on the lamp bulbs.

817
01:17:56,886 --> 01:17:59,673
And flowers. And china.

818
01:18:01,015 --> 01:18:03,091
Gold-rimmed china.

819
01:18:05,019 --> 01:18:07,426
China my mother gave us.

820
01:18:09,190 --> 01:18:12,689
My mother didn't buy these
for sluts to eat off!

821
01:18:15,446 --> 01:18:17,735
- Oh, Doc!
- Gonna get me a drink.

822
01:18:17,907 --> 01:18:21,276
No, please don't!
Daddy, please don't!

823
01:18:21,452 --> 01:18:25,699
- You stay away from me.
- Doc, you know what it does to you.

824
01:18:25,873 --> 01:18:29,324
Makes me want to come home
and look at you, you...

825
01:18:41,138 --> 01:18:44,258
Soon I'm gonna have another.
And another.

826
01:18:44,433 --> 01:18:47,767
Ed, Ed, he's home.
Can you come over, Ed?

827
01:18:47,937 --> 01:18:52,646
- He's drinking. I don't know what to do!
- Get away from that phone!

828
01:18:52,817 --> 01:18:55,189
Please come. He's got a knife!

829
01:18:56,070 --> 01:18:59,355
No! Daddy!
No. No, Doc. Please, Daddy.

830
01:18:59,532 --> 01:19:03,280
That's right,
tell the whole world that I'm drunk.

831
01:19:03,452 --> 01:19:08,743
Scream, you fat slut! Holler
so the neighbours think I've beaten you.

832
01:19:09,417 --> 01:19:12,951
Where's Bruce now?
Under Marie's bed?

833
01:19:13,129 --> 01:19:15,335
Got all pretty for him, didn't you?

834
01:19:15,506 --> 01:19:19,504
Combed your hair. Even washed
your neck and put on a girdle.

835
01:19:19,677 --> 01:19:22,880
Please don't talk like that.
I'd rather you hit me.

836
01:19:23,055 --> 01:19:26,720
I can't bear you to say
things like that. Talking crazy!

837
01:19:26,892 --> 01:19:29,466
I'm making sense for the first time ever!

838
01:19:29,645 --> 01:19:33,809
Didn't think I knew about it, did you?
I heard 'em sneaking in.

839
01:19:33,983 --> 01:19:37,981
I saw them! You thought you
were putting something over on me.

840
01:19:38,154 --> 01:19:40,727
No, Doc, I didn't know anything about it.

841
01:19:40,906 --> 01:19:45,782
You're crazy if you think I didn't know!
Running a regular lonely-hearts place.

842
01:19:45,953 --> 01:19:50,081
- Probably since we were married.
- No, it's not true!

843
01:19:50,249 --> 01:19:53,867
- You're lying!
- No, Daddy! Daddy, please!

844
01:19:54,045 --> 01:19:57,829
That's not gonna happen any more.
I'm gonna fix you.

845
01:19:58,007 --> 01:20:01,590
- Once and for all!
- No! Don't do this to me!

846
01:20:01,761 --> 01:20:06,090
Daddy! It's me, Lola!

847
01:20:28,204 --> 01:20:30,611
What's going on? I heard...

848
01:20:33,959 --> 01:20:37,079
- Are you all right, lady?
- Yes, I'm fine.

849
01:20:37,254 --> 01:20:41,418
Some men will be here soon.
Everything will be all right.

850
01:20:45,513 --> 01:20:48,086
We got here as soon as we could.

851
01:20:49,100 --> 01:20:52,054
- Tried to use that on you?
- I'm all right.

852
01:20:52,228 --> 01:20:56,012
We can't leave him here
if he's playing with knives.

853
01:21:03,239 --> 01:21:07,189
Doc, it's Ed and Elmo.
We're gonna take care of you.

854
01:21:10,079 --> 01:21:14,029
- Get off me.
- How much has he had?

855
01:21:14,208 --> 01:21:18,917
- I don't know. He hasn't been home.
- It's hit him hard.

856
01:21:19,088 --> 01:21:23,168
- Shall I get him some coffee?
- No, he's past that.

857
01:21:23,342 --> 01:21:27,422
- Get out. This is my house.
- We're taking you with us.

858
01:21:27,596 --> 01:21:30,348
- Where are you taking him?
- City hospital.

859
01:21:30,516 --> 01:21:36,139
No! No, wait, don't take me there.
That's where they put the crazy people.

860
01:21:36,313 --> 01:21:39,765
If you don't come peacefully,
we'll call the cops.

861
01:21:39,942 --> 01:21:44,403
You'll have to wear this off in the cooler.
You wouldn't like that.

862
01:21:44,572 --> 01:21:46,730
OK. OK, I'll go.

863
01:21:47,950 --> 01:21:50,358
Just give me one more drink. Please.

864
01:21:50,536 --> 01:21:54,403
- Please don't.
- Can't make much difference now.

865
01:21:54,582 --> 01:21:57,251
OK, Doc, we're gonna give you a drink.

866
01:22:05,551 --> 01:22:09,880
Take a good one. It's gonna be your last
for a long, long time.

867
01:22:13,434 --> 01:22:17,763
He'll be there a few days,
then he'll be home, good as new.

868
01:22:23,736 --> 01:22:26,227
OK. I'm all right.

869
01:22:27,490 --> 01:22:29,815
It's all right.

870
01:22:31,452 --> 01:22:34,785
Honey, stop them!
Don't let them take me!

871
01:22:34,955 --> 01:22:37,873
Stop them, somebody! Please!

872
01:22:38,042 --> 01:22:41,078
No! No, wait! Wait, Ed!

873
01:22:42,129 --> 01:22:45,130
- Don't, Mrs Delaney.
- I want to go with him!

874
01:22:45,299 --> 01:22:48,549
No, lady, that's no place for you.

875
01:22:49,970 --> 01:22:52,544
You'll only be in the way.

876
01:22:59,438 --> 01:23:03,436
- Is there anything I can do for you?
- No, I guess not.

877
01:23:03,609 --> 01:23:07,654
Keep busy, Mrs Delaney.
Keep busy and forget it.

878
01:23:07,822 --> 01:23:12,697
Yes. I'm gonna keep busy, Mrs Coffman.

879
01:23:14,245 --> 01:23:16,321
Look at this mess.

880
01:23:16,497 --> 01:23:19,533
And he'd been behaving so long.

881
01:23:21,877 --> 01:23:23,953
I'll get it.

882
01:23:28,509 --> 01:23:30,881
Hello? Yes.

883
01:23:31,929 --> 01:23:34,385
Mrs Delaney, I'll get it.

884
01:23:34,557 --> 01:23:38,008
A telegram from
Mr and Mrs Bruce Cunningham.

885
01:23:41,188 --> 01:23:45,056
Yes, yes, I am listening.
Married tonight. Yes.

886
01:23:45,234 --> 01:23:48,069
Mrs Delaney, you mustn't.

887
01:23:49,030 --> 01:23:51,437
Thanks. Send it over later.

888
01:24:03,794 --> 01:24:05,372
Delaney.

889
01:24:05,546 --> 01:24:09,710
Is he all right, Ed? I had to come.
He gets scared without me.

890
01:24:09,884 --> 01:24:11,960
- This is Mrs Delaney.
- Ma'am.

891
01:24:12,136 --> 01:24:14,592
- Can I see him?
- You can see him later.

892
01:24:14,764 --> 01:24:18,382
- We just gave him a sedative.
- No, I gotta see him now.

893
01:24:19,477 --> 01:24:21,968
All right, come with me.

894
01:24:39,872 --> 01:24:42,624
- Not in here?
- He's safer here.

895
01:24:42,792 --> 01:24:45,461
He tried to throw himself out of the car.

896
01:25:02,103 --> 01:25:04,179
Doc.

897
01:25:05,189 --> 01:25:08,024
Daddy. Daddy?

898
01:25:10,444 --> 01:25:14,062
- I don't think he hears me.
- Probably not.

899
01:25:16,242 --> 01:25:18,733
He's trying to say something.

900
01:25:18,911 --> 01:25:23,538
Who's Lola, pretty Lola?
He keeps mumbling, "Pretty Lola."

901
01:25:29,171 --> 01:25:31,247
That's me.

902
01:25:44,020 --> 01:25:46,096
Mrs Delaney.

903
01:25:53,112 --> 01:25:55,650
You wanna come in for coffee?

904
01:25:55,823 --> 01:25:59,322
No, thanks. We were having breakfast
when you called.

905
01:25:59,493 --> 01:26:01,569
You get some sleep.

906
01:27:04,975 --> 01:27:07,134
Long distance.

907
01:27:07,311 --> 01:27:09,802
I want Maple 240.

908
01:27:11,941 --> 01:27:15,357
This is Valley 846.

909
01:27:22,743 --> 01:27:28,330
Hello, Mom. It's Lola, Mom.
How are you?

910
01:27:30,835 --> 01:27:35,413
Yeah. Yeah, I know, Mom,
but Doc's sick again.

911
01:27:37,883 --> 01:27:43,126
Do you think Dad would mind very
much if I came home for a little while?

912
01:27:44,557 --> 01:27:47,130
I'm awfully unhappy, Mom.

913
01:27:49,687 --> 01:27:52,308
Don't you think just for a little while?

914
01:27:52,481 --> 01:27:56,016
Just until I've made up my mind
what to do.

915
01:28:02,658 --> 01:28:05,232
All right, Mom.

916
01:28:05,411 --> 01:28:10,120
Oh, no. No, it wouldn't
do any good for you to come here.

917
01:28:11,625 --> 01:28:14,413
I'll... I'll let you know if I need you.

918
01:28:16,213 --> 01:28:18,289
Thanks, Mom.

919
01:28:19,342 --> 01:28:22,259
And... tell Daddy hello.

920
01:29:06,972 --> 01:29:09,049
You forgot your bag, Doc.

921
01:29:10,643 --> 01:29:13,763
- I don't know how to thank you.
- We'll see you later.

922
01:29:13,938 --> 01:29:18,066
- If there's any trouble...
- Call us any time. So long, Doc.

923
01:29:21,487 --> 01:29:23,563
And good luck.

924
01:29:44,552 --> 01:29:46,628
Lola?

925
01:29:56,605 --> 01:29:58,681
Lola?

926
01:30:06,073 --> 01:30:08,149
Doc?

927
01:30:12,538 --> 01:30:15,824
Daddy... are you all right?

928
01:30:16,959 --> 01:30:19,118
Yes, I'm all right.

929
01:30:23,049 --> 01:30:27,177
Honey, please don't stand like that.
Like I was gonna...

930
01:30:27,345 --> 01:30:29,752
I'm sorry, Doc.

931
01:30:31,140 --> 01:30:34,972
- How have you been?
- Oh, I'm all right.

932
01:30:35,144 --> 01:30:37,220
I've been fine.

933
01:30:38,647 --> 01:30:43,606
I got a letter and a telegram from Marie.
She and Bruce got married.

934
01:30:44,737 --> 01:30:47,310
After all our worrying about her.

935
01:30:49,325 --> 01:30:54,568
- Did you like Bruce?
- He was awful nice. Like I expected.

936
01:30:54,747 --> 01:30:57,320
Marie wrote something awful nice.

937
01:30:57,500 --> 01:31:00,999
She said you really kept her
from falling for Turk.

938
01:31:02,630 --> 01:31:05,750
- I hope she'll be happy.
- Oh, sure, Doc.

939
01:31:07,218 --> 01:31:09,887
We're gonna be happy, too, Daddy.

940
01:31:12,640 --> 01:31:14,716
Did they treat you all right?

941
01:31:16,185 --> 01:31:19,519
Don't ever leave me.
Please don't ever leave me.

942
01:31:19,689 --> 01:31:24,600
I don't know what I did or what I said.
I can hardly remember anything.

943
01:31:24,777 --> 01:31:28,857
But please forgive me.
I'll try to make everything up.

944
01:31:29,949 --> 01:31:32,155
I'd never leave you, Daddy.

945
01:31:34,286 --> 01:31:36,362
You're all I got, Doc.

946
01:31:39,291 --> 01:31:41,414
You're all I ever had.

947
01:31:55,057 --> 01:31:58,177
- I feel better already.
- Yes, so do I.

948
01:32:00,479 --> 01:32:03,017
Did you have any breakfast?

949
01:32:03,190 --> 01:32:05,764
No. When the doctor told me I could go,

950
01:32:05,943 --> 01:32:09,359
I thought I'd wait till I got here
and make breakfast myself.

951
01:32:09,530 --> 01:32:11,736
No, I'll get you some breakfast.

952
01:32:11,907 --> 01:32:15,323
Come in the kitchen
and I'll get you a hot breakfast.

953
01:32:15,494 --> 01:32:17,653
I'll scramble you some eggs.

954
01:32:19,206 --> 01:32:21,282
Come on, Doc.

955
01:32:26,589 --> 01:32:29,839
You sit down and
I'll get you your fruit juice.

956
01:32:31,469 --> 01:32:33,876
And we got bacon, too, Doc.

957
01:32:36,474 --> 01:32:39,391
My, it's expensive now, you know.

958
01:32:40,728 --> 01:32:43,017
There you are, Daddy.

959
01:32:44,398 --> 01:32:47,601
I'll light the oven
and make you some toast.

960
01:32:48,736 --> 01:32:53,777
- And Doc, we got orange marmalade.
- It looks different here.

961
01:32:53,949 --> 01:32:58,908
Oh, sure, I fixed it all up. We got
new curtains. I painted the ice box.

962
01:32:59,080 --> 01:33:02,365
- Looks nice.
- It's gonna stay nice, too.

963
01:33:02,541 --> 01:33:05,875
I had another dream
the other night, Doc.

964
01:33:06,962 --> 01:33:12,004
- About Little Sheba?
- About everything and everybody.

965
01:33:12,176 --> 01:33:15,343
Marie and I was going to the Olympics.

966
01:33:15,513 --> 01:33:18,964
Only it was back in
our old high school stadium.

967
01:33:19,141 --> 01:33:21,513
There was thousands of people there.

968
01:33:21,686 --> 01:33:25,185
Turk was in out in the field,
throwing the javelin.

969
01:33:25,356 --> 01:33:28,891
Every time he threw it,
the crowd would roar.

970
01:33:29,068 --> 01:33:31,641
You know who the man in charge was?

971
01:33:31,821 --> 01:33:34,146
My father.

972
01:33:35,491 --> 01:33:41,031
But Turk kept changing into somebody
else, so my father disqualified him.

973
01:33:41,205 --> 01:33:43,826
Then he had to sit on the sidelines.

974
01:33:43,999 --> 01:33:46,621
Guess who took his place, Daddy.

975
01:33:46,794 --> 01:33:51,954
You. You came trotting out
on the field just as big as you please.

976
01:33:52,133 --> 01:33:54,421
- How'd I do, baby?
- Oh, fine.

977
01:33:54,593 --> 01:33:59,339
You picked up the javelin like it was
real heavy, but you threw it, Doc.

978
01:33:59,515 --> 01:34:02,184
You threw it clear up in the sky.

979
01:34:02,351 --> 01:34:04,427
It never came down again.

980
01:34:05,479 --> 01:34:07,555
Then it started to rain.

981
01:34:07,732 --> 01:34:11,943
I was going nearly crazy
'cause I couldn't find Little Sheba.

982
01:34:12,111 --> 01:34:15,978
There were so many people,
I didn't know where to look.

983
01:34:16,157 --> 01:34:18,233
You was waiting to take me home.

984
01:34:18,409 --> 01:34:22,193
So we walked and walked
through the mud and the slush.

985
01:34:22,371 --> 01:34:24,993
People was all crowding around us.

986
01:34:26,292 --> 01:34:29,661
And then... This is the sad part, Daddy.

987
01:34:29,837 --> 01:34:32,328
All of a sudden, I saw Little Sheba.

988
01:34:32,506 --> 01:34:35,792
She was lying
in the middle of the field, dead.

989
01:34:36,886 --> 01:34:40,836
I felt terrible, Doc.
Nobody else paid any attention.

990
01:34:41,015 --> 01:34:43,091
But I cried and cried.

991
01:34:44,143 --> 01:34:47,844
It made me feel awful.
That sweet little puppy.

992
01:34:48,022 --> 01:34:53,526
Her white fur all smeared with mud.
No one to stop and take care of her.

993
01:34:53,694 --> 01:34:57,822
- Why couldn't you?
- You wouldn't let me.

994
01:34:57,990 --> 01:35:02,948
You kept saying, "We can't
stay here, honey, we gotta go on."

995
01:35:04,580 --> 01:35:08,530
- Ain't that strange?
- Dreams are funny.

996
01:35:14,840 --> 01:35:18,459
I don't think Little Sheba's
ever coming back, Doc.

997
01:35:18,636 --> 01:35:22,634
- I ain't gonna call her any more.
- Not much point in it, baby.

998
01:35:22,807 --> 01:35:24,965
I guess she's gone for good.

999
01:35:27,561 --> 01:35:29,637
I'll fix your eggs.

1000
01:35:34,568 --> 01:35:36,644
It's good to be home.

1001
01:35:53,546 --> 01:35:55,622
