1
00:00:26,626 --> 00:00:32,121
LAST YEAR AT MARIENBAD

2
00:01:52,846 --> 00:01:57,215
...as if the floor were still
sand and gravel, or stone slabs...

3
00:01:57,283 --> 00:02:01,310
over which I advanced
once again...

4
00:02:01,387 --> 00:02:05,221
through the corridors,
salons, galleries...

5
00:02:05,291 --> 00:02:09,057
the structure of this mournful
mansion from another age...

6
00:02:09,129 --> 00:02:11,996
this huge and luxurious mansion...

7
00:02:41,261 --> 00:02:45,197
...silent rooms,
where footsteps are absorbed...

8
00:02:45,265 --> 00:02:47,665
by carpets so heavy, so thick...

9
00:02:47,734 --> 00:02:50,669
that one hears no step...

10
00:02:50,737 --> 00:02:54,503
as if the very ear of him
who advances once again...

11
00:03:26,873 --> 00:03:31,810
...transverse corridors
leading to deserted salons...

12
00:03:31,878 --> 00:03:35,678
encrusted with the ornamentation
of another age...

13
00:03:35,748 --> 00:03:39,616
silent rooms,
where footsteps are absorbed...

14
00:03:39,686 --> 00:03:42,416
by carpets so heavy, so thick...

15
00:03:42,488 --> 00:03:47,983
that one hears no step,
as if the very ear...

16
00:04:03,743 --> 00:04:08,112
...stone slabs, over which
I advanced once again...

17
00:04:09,182 --> 00:04:13,209
through the corridors,
salons, galleries...

18
00:04:13,286 --> 00:04:16,119
the structure of this mournful
mansion from another age...

19
00:04:16,189 --> 00:04:20,649
this huge and luxurious mansion...

20
00:04:20,727 --> 00:04:23,195
where corridors without end
follow upon corridors...

21
00:04:24,030 --> 00:04:25,861
silent, deserted...

22
00:04:25,932 --> 00:04:27,923
encrusted with cold,
heavy ornamentation...

23
00:04:28,001 --> 00:04:31,994
paneling, stucco,
moldings, marble...

24
00:04:32,071 --> 00:04:35,837
black mirrors,
shadowy paintings, pillars...

25
00:05:30,063 --> 00:05:34,466
...sculptured portals,
ranks of doors, galleries...

26
00:05:34,534 --> 00:05:39,597
transverse corridors
leading to deserted salons...

27
00:05:39,672 --> 00:05:43,199
encrusted with the ornamentation
of another age...

28
00:05:44,277 --> 00:05:47,713
silent rooms,
where footsteps are absorbed...

29
00:05:47,780 --> 00:05:50,180
by carpets so heavy, so thick...

30
00:05:50,249 --> 00:05:53,685
that one hears no step...

31
00:05:53,753 --> 00:05:58,622
as if the very ear were far away...

32
00:05:58,691 --> 00:06:01,182
far away from this numb,
barren decor...

33
00:06:01,260 --> 00:06:04,593
far from this elaborate frieze
beneath the cornice...

34
00:06:04,664 --> 00:06:06,598
with its branches and garlands...

35
00:06:06,666 --> 00:06:08,793
like dead leaves...

36
00:06:08,868 --> 00:06:13,396
as if the floor were still
sand and gravel, or stone slabs...

37
00:06:13,473 --> 00:06:16,567
over which I advanced

once again...

38
00:06:16,642 --> 00:06:18,906
as though to meet you...

39
00:06:18,978 --> 00:06:21,708
between richly panelled walls...

40
00:06:21,781 --> 00:06:25,683
stucco, moldings, paintings...

41
00:06:25,752 --> 00:06:29,188
framed prints
amidst which I advanced...

42
00:06:30,189 --> 00:06:34,922
among which I found myself
already...

43
00:06:34,994 --> 00:06:37,121
waiting for you...

44
00:06:37,697 --> 00:06:40,632
very far from the setting
I stand in now...

45
00:06:41,768 --> 00:06:44,862
before you, waiting again...

46
00:06:44,937 --> 00:06:47,531
for one who will not come again...

47
00:06:48,307 --> 00:06:52,937
who will no longer
keep us apart...

48
00:06:53,846 --> 00:06:55,837
tear you from me.

49
00:06:58,451 --> 00:07:04,219
We must wait a few minutes,
a few seconds--

50
00:07:04,290 --> 00:07:07,589
A few more seconds,
as though you were still hesitant...

51
00:07:07,660 --> 00:07:09,890
to separate from him,
from yourself...

52
00:07:09,962 --> 00:07:13,329
as though his fading image
might reappear...

53
00:07:13,399 --> 00:07:16,562
in this same place
where you imagined it...

54
00:07:16,636 --> 00:07:18,900
fearfully or hopefully...

55
00:07:18,971 --> 00:07:21,303
such was your fear
of losing this link--

56
00:07:21,374 --> 00:07:25,606
No, this hope
is now pointless.

57
00:07:25,778 --> 00:07:30,977
Gone now this fear of losing
such a link, a prison, a lie.

58
00:07:31,050 --> 00:07:33,848
This story is already over.

59
00:07:33,920 --> 00:07:37,651
A few seconds more,
it has become frozen--

60
00:07:37,723 --> 00:07:40,715
Forever, a past of marble...

61
00:07:40,793 --> 00:07:43,523
like this garden
carved in stone...

62
00:07:43,596 --> 00:07:47,054
this mansion,
its rooms deserted now...

63
00:07:47,133 --> 00:07:51,661
these still, silent,
perhaps long-dead people...

64
00:07:51,737 --> 00:07:54,035
still guarding
the web of corridors...

65
00:07:54,106 --> 00:07:57,007
along which I advanced
to meet you...

66
00:07:57,076 --> 00:07:59,977
between hedgerows of faces,
masklike...

67
00:08:00,046 --> 00:08:03,140
watchful, indifferent...

68
00:08:03,216 --> 00:08:05,548
towards you
as you still hesitate, perhaps...

69
00:08:05,618 --> 00:08:09,179
gazing at the entrance
to this garden.

70
00:08:12,124 --> 00:08:13,614
There.

71
00:08:16,062 --> 00:08:17,962
Now...

72
00:08:19,932 --> 00:08:21,923
I am yours.

73
00:08:51,664 --> 00:08:55,498
It must have been
in 1928 or 1929--

74
00:09:04,010 --> 00:09:06,478
Really...
it's unbelievable.

75
00:09:07,813 --> 00:09:10,338
I think we already met.

76
00:09:48,120 --> 00:09:50,748
It has nothing to do with it.

77
00:09:50,823 --> 00:09:53,053
And the fact that if he or she
did anything...

78
00:09:53,125 --> 00:09:54,990
that may seem--

79
00:09:57,296 --> 00:09:59,321
The weather was awful
for months.

80
00:09:59,398 --> 00:10:01,389
We couldn't get out,
when suddenly--

81
00:10:06,872 --> 00:10:08,339
Did you see it yourself?

82
00:10:08,407 --> 00:10:10,341
No, a friend told me.

83
00:10:10,409 --> 00:10:13,640
If a friend told you--

84
00:10:28,327 --> 00:10:32,263
Don't be so concerned
about what others are thinking.

85
00:10:33,332 --> 00:10:35,698
You said you would listen
to no one but me.

86
00:10:41,807 --> 00:10:45,004
Listen then, I can no longer
stand this role.

87
00:10:45,077 --> 00:10:47,739
This silence, these walls...

88
00:10:47,813 --> 00:10:49,280
these whisperings
you condemn me to--

89
00:10:49,348 --> 00:10:51,213
Don't raise your voice so.

90
00:10:51,283 --> 00:10:54,980
These whisperings, worse than
silence, you condemn me to.

91
00:10:55,054 --> 00:10:59,081
These days, worse than death,
we live through side by side...

92
00:10:59,158 --> 00:11:01,592
like two coffins
buried together...

93
00:11:01,661 --> 00:11:04,095
in a petrified garden.

94
00:11:05,898 --> 00:11:08,162
A comforting, ordered garden,
neatly trimmed...

95
00:11:08,234 --> 00:11:12,364
with formal paths
which we pace together...

96
00:11:12,438 --> 00:11:14,531
side by side, day after day...

97
00:11:14,607 --> 00:11:18,543
maintaining our distance
without ever--

98
00:11:25,651 --> 00:11:27,516
Quite incredible!

99
00:11:30,756 --> 00:11:35,489
I think it must have been
in '28...

100
00:11:36,195 --> 00:11:38,425
'28 or '29--

101
00:11:38,597 --> 00:11:42,533
It froze for a week
in the summer of 1929--

102
00:11:47,473 --> 00:11:50,101
A very beautiful woman.

103
00:11:51,610 --> 00:11:53,475
Too fanciful.

104
00:12:14,734 --> 00:12:17,532
Enough of these walls,
whisperings...

105
00:12:18,304 --> 00:12:20,602
days lived through
side by side...

106
00:12:20,673 --> 00:12:25,133
pacing these corridors,
maintaining our distance...

107
00:12:25,544 --> 00:12:27,409
yet these fingers
were meant to entwine...

108
00:12:27,480 --> 00:12:29,744
these mouths...

109
00:12:29,815 --> 00:12:33,581
Fingers meant to entwine,
eyes meant to see you...

110
00:12:33,652 --> 00:12:37,486
but forced to turn
to these walls of another age...

111
00:12:37,556 --> 00:12:39,615
paneling, cut-glass mirrors...

112
00:12:39,692 --> 00:12:41,455
old-fashioned paintings...

113
00:12:41,527 --> 00:12:45,327
stucco, trompe l'oeil capitals...

114
00:12:45,397 --> 00:12:47,092
false doors, false columns...

115
00:12:47,166 --> 00:12:49,760
false perspectives.

116
00:12:52,304 --> 00:12:54,864
It wasn't really
so extraordinary.

117
00:12:54,940 --> 00:12:57,033
He initiated it,
having worked out...

118
00:12:57,109 --> 00:12:59,771
all the possibilities.

119
00:13:03,916 --> 00:13:06,350
Downy wings, like a swan's.

120
00:13:06,852 --> 00:13:10,015
-Been here long?
-No, but I've been here before.

121
00:13:10,089 --> 00:13:12,922
-Do you like the place?
-Not particularly.

122
00:13:12,992 --> 00:13:15,586
It just so happens that
we always end up here.

123
00:13:15,661 --> 00:13:17,652
My father, you see--

124
00:13:21,233 --> 00:13:23,497
A shoe with a broken heel--

125
00:13:25,070 --> 00:13:27,300
No means of escape?

126
00:13:27,773 --> 00:13:30,333
No means of escape.

127
00:13:31,710 --> 00:13:33,837
Don't you know the story?

128
00:13:33,913 --> 00:13:35,972
It was all the gossip last year.

129
00:13:36,482 --> 00:13:38,916
Frank said her father
had asked him...

130
00:13:38,984 --> 00:13:41,077
to keep an eye on her.

131
00:13:41,153 --> 00:13:46,181
A funny sort of eye,
as she discovered...

132
00:13:46,258 --> 00:13:50,024
when he tried to enter her room
on the pretext that...

133
00:13:50,095 --> 00:13:54,395
he wanted to explain
the painting.

134
00:13:54,466 --> 00:13:57,833
The fact of having
a German passport proves nothing.

135
00:13:57,903 --> 00:14:01,896
His presence here, old man,
has no connection.

136
00:14:14,553 --> 00:14:16,544
I suggest we play
another game.

137
00:14:16,622 --> 00:14:18,647
I know a game I always win.

138
00:14:18,724 --> 00:14:22,091
If you can't lose,
it's no game.

139
00:14:22,161 --> 00:14:25,597
I can lose, but I always win.

140
00:14:26,899 --> 00:14:28,230
Let's try it.

141
00:14:28,567 --> 00:14:33,800
Two people play.
The cards are laid out like this.

142
00:14:39,211 --> 00:14:40,872
Seven.

143
00:14:43,549 --> 00:14:45,210
Five.

144
00:14:47,586 --> 00:14:49,247
Three.

145
00:14:50,956 --> 00:14:52,617
One.

146
00:14:53,859 --> 00:14:58,193
Each player can pick up
as many cards as he likes...

147
00:14:58,898 --> 00:15:01,765
but only from one row
each time.

148
00:15:01,901 --> 00:15:05,735
The player who picks up
the last card is the loser.

149
00:15:06,705 --> 00:15:08,696
Will you start?

150
00:15:35,734 --> 00:15:37,759
You are still the same...

151
00:15:37,836 --> 00:15:40,396
as though I left you
only yesterday.

152
00:15:40,472 --> 00:15:42,531
What has become of you
all this time?

153
00:15:42,608 --> 00:15:46,169
Nothing, since I am
still the same.

154
00:15:46,712 --> 00:15:48,202
Not married?

155
00:15:48,781 --> 00:15:51,341
-Why not?
-I value my freedom.

156
00:15:52,518 --> 00:15:55,112
-Why not here?
-It's a funny place.

157
00:15:55,187 --> 00:15:58,918
-To be free, you mean?
-Yes, especially that.

158
00:15:58,991 --> 00:16:00,982
You're still the same.

159
00:16:02,261 --> 00:16:04,252
You're still the same.

160
00:16:26,986 --> 00:16:29,511
But you hardly seem
to remember.

161
00:16:35,327 --> 00:16:37,727
Yet you know
these baroque ornaments...

162
00:16:38,230 --> 00:16:40,824
this stucco hand,
holding grapes...

163
00:16:41,033 --> 00:16:42,864
behind it, foliage...

164
00:16:42,935 --> 00:16:46,200
as though from a garden
awaiting us.

165
00:16:48,340 --> 00:16:50,365
Have you never noticed this?

166
00:16:50,442 --> 00:16:53,377
I've never had
such a good guide before.

167
00:16:53,445 --> 00:16:56,903
You know the saying:
from stem to stern.

168
00:16:59,151 --> 00:17:03,554
There are many other things
to see, if you wish.

169
00:17:03,622 --> 00:17:05,852
I'd love to.

170
00:17:06,525 --> 00:17:10,791
-Are there so many secrets here?
-Legions.

171
00:17:12,164 --> 00:17:14,496
How mysterious you seem.

172
00:17:21,607 --> 00:17:23,905
Why do you look at me
like that?

173
00:17:28,981 --> 00:17:31,916
You hardly seem
to remember me.

174
00:18:14,026 --> 00:18:18,395
I first saw you
in the gardens of Frederiksbad.

175
00:18:19,031 --> 00:18:21,591
You stood apart
from the others...

176
00:18:21,667 --> 00:18:23,897
by a stone balustrade...

177
00:18:23,969 --> 00:18:28,303
on which your hand rested,
your arm half-extended.

178
00:18:28,807 --> 00:18:31,799
You were looking
towards the broadwalk.

179
00:18:31,877 --> 00:18:33,868
You didn't see me approach.

180
00:18:34,279 --> 00:18:38,511
Then you became aware
of my footsteps on the gravel...

181
00:18:39,418 --> 00:18:41,477
and you turned your head.

182
00:18:42,654 --> 00:18:46,351
I don't think it was me.
You're mistaken.

183
00:18:47,826 --> 00:18:49,760
Remember.

184
00:18:51,396 --> 00:18:56,698
We were near some stone figures
on a plinth...

185
00:18:57,803 --> 00:19:00,328
a man and a woman,
in classical style...

186
00:19:00,772 --> 00:19:05,300
whose suspended gestures
seemed to hold some significance.

187
00:19:06,578 --> 00:19:09,206
You asked me who they were.

188
00:19:09,448 --> 00:19:12,383
I answered that I didn't know.

189
00:19:12,851 --> 00:19:15,752
You began to guess,
and I said...

190
00:19:15,821 --> 00:19:18,381
it could as well be
you and l.

191
00:19:18,957 --> 00:19:21,448
Then you began to laugh.

192
00:19:23,228 --> 00:19:27,062
I love-- I loved then--

193
00:19:27,833 --> 00:19:29,926
to hear you laugh.

194
00:19:33,739 --> 00:19:36,537
The other people
had drawn nearer.

195
00:19:36,675 --> 00:19:39,542
Someone identified the statue.

196
00:19:39,912 --> 00:19:45,612
Mythological characters,
gods or heroes of ancient Greece.

197
00:19:45,684 --> 00:19:50,018
Or perhaps it was an allegory
or something like that.

198
00:19:50,756 --> 00:19:55,125
You were no longer listening.
You seemed to be far away.

199
00:19:55,827 --> 00:19:59,354
Once more your eyes
were grave, vacant.

200
00:20:00,499 --> 00:20:05,436
You turned aside to gaze down
the broadwalk again.

201
00:20:27,159 --> 00:20:30,890
Once again we were separated.

202
00:20:59,725 --> 00:21:01,386
It's impossible!

203
00:21:06,632 --> 00:21:08,566
Let's go for a walk.

204
00:21:08,634 --> 00:21:10,033
Frank hasn't arrived yet.

205
00:21:10,102 --> 00:21:13,868
You know the saying:
from stem to stern.

206
00:21:38,997 --> 00:21:41,329
What if you play first?

207
00:21:47,773 --> 00:21:50,367
Once again I advanced...

208
00:21:51,310 --> 00:21:55,076
alone, along these
same corridors...

209
00:21:55,247 --> 00:21:57,715
through the same deserted
rooms...

210
00:21:57,783 --> 00:22:00,308
past the same colonnades...

211
00:22:00,385 --> 00:22:02,683
the same
windowless galleries...

212
00:22:02,754 --> 00:22:05,188
across the same thresholds...

213
00:22:05,257 --> 00:22:10,923
taking this route
in the labyrinth as if by chance...

214
00:22:23,508 --> 00:22:25,203
and once again...

215
00:22:25,844 --> 00:22:30,281
everything was deserted
in this immense hotel...

216
00:22:31,616 --> 00:22:34,517
empty salons, corridors...

217
00:22:34,786 --> 00:22:37,016
salons, doors...

218
00:22:37,089 --> 00:22:39,080
doors, salons...

219
00:22:39,291 --> 00:22:41,987
empty chairs,
deep armchairs...

220
00:22:42,627 --> 00:22:45,027
stairs, steps...

221
00:22:45,097 --> 00:22:47,531
steps, one after another...

222
00:22:47,599 --> 00:22:50,466
glass objects, empty glasses...

223
00:22:50,535 --> 00:22:53,902
a dropped glass,
a glass partition...

224
00:22:53,972 --> 00:22:57,169
letters, a lost letter...

225
00:22:57,242 --> 00:22:59,904
keys hanging from their rings...

226
00:22:59,978 --> 00:23:01,605
numbered door keys:

227
00:23:01,680 --> 00:23:06,777
309, 307, 305, 303...

228
00:23:06,852 --> 00:23:09,343
chandeliers, chandeliers,

229
00:23:09,421 --> 00:23:11,685
pearls, mirrors...

230
00:23:11,757 --> 00:23:14,817
corridors with not a soul
in sight.

231
00:23:20,198 --> 00:23:23,599
And the garden,
like all else, was deserted.

232
00:23:29,708 --> 00:23:33,804
It was last year.
Have I changed so much, then?

233
00:23:33,879 --> 00:23:36,575
Or are you pretending
not to recognize me?

234
00:23:37,015 --> 00:23:39,643
A year already, perhaps more.

235
00:23:40,419 --> 00:23:42,944
You, at least,
are still the same.

236
00:23:43,021 --> 00:23:45,455
You have still
the same dreamy eyes...

237
00:23:45,524 --> 00:23:46,957
the same smile...

238
00:23:47,025 --> 00:23:48,856
the same sudden laugh...

239
00:23:48,927 --> 00:23:53,955
the same brusque
arm movement...

240
00:23:54,566 --> 00:23:57,228
the same way of resting
your hand on your shoulder...

241
00:23:58,770 --> 00:24:02,262
and you still use
the same perfume.

242
00:24:02,974 --> 00:24:04,601
Remember...

243
00:24:04,676 --> 00:24:07,509
the gardens
of Frederiksbad.

244
00:24:09,948 --> 00:24:12,041
You were alone, apart...

245
00:24:12,384 --> 00:24:16,115
almost leaning
against a stone balustrade...

246
00:24:16,188 --> 00:24:20,852
on which your hand rested,
your arm half-extended.

247
00:24:25,630 --> 00:24:28,360
You were looking
towards the broadwalk.

248
00:24:28,733 --> 00:24:31,099
I approached you.

249
00:24:31,403 --> 00:24:36,067
But I stopped short
and looked at you.

250
00:24:37,576 --> 00:24:40,443
You turned towards me now.

251
00:24:43,048 --> 00:24:45,846
Yet you didn't seem
to see me.

252
00:24:45,917 --> 00:24:49,876
I looked at you,
yet you made no sign.

253
00:24:50,121 --> 00:24:52,612
"You seem so alive," I said.

254
00:24:52,691 --> 00:24:55,455
You merely smiled in reply.

255
00:24:55,927 --> 00:24:58,896
To make conversation,
I spoke about the statue.

256
00:24:58,964 --> 00:25:03,162
I said the man wanted to stop
the young woman.

257
00:25:03,235 --> 00:25:06,932
He had noticed something,
a danger...

258
00:25:07,005 --> 00:25:09,906
and he raised his arm
to stop her.

259
00:25:09,975 --> 00:25:14,537
You replied that it was
the woman who had seen something.

260
00:25:14,613 --> 00:25:19,607
Something marvelous,
which she was pointing out.

261
00:25:20,785 --> 00:25:23,015
Both our theories
could be right.

262
00:25:23,221 --> 00:25:27,954
Having left their home,
they have journeyed for days.

263
00:25:28,793 --> 00:25:32,126
They have come
to the top of a cliff.

264
00:25:32,364 --> 00:25:36,130
He stops her going
too near the edge...

265
00:25:36,201 --> 00:25:39,830
while she points to the sea
stretching to the horizon.

266
00:25:40,939 --> 00:25:43,908
Then you asked me their names.

267
00:25:44,709 --> 00:25:47,234
I said their names didn't matter.

268
00:25:47,879 --> 00:25:51,508
You disagreed
and proceeded to name them...

269
00:25:52,284 --> 00:25:54,479
at random, I think.

270
00:25:54,853 --> 00:25:58,414
Then I said they could as well
be you and l...

271
00:26:01,626 --> 00:26:03,321
or anyone.

272
00:26:10,135 --> 00:26:13,798
Don't name them.
They could mean so many things.

273
00:26:13,872 --> 00:26:17,308
You're forgetting the dog.
Why do they have a dog?

274
00:26:17,709 --> 00:26:21,406
It's not theirs. It's a stray.

275
00:26:22,080 --> 00:26:24,071
It's so close
to its mistress, though.

276
00:26:24,149 --> 00:26:26,140
She's not its mistress.

277
00:26:26,217 --> 00:26:29,482
It's close
because the plinth is small.

278
00:26:30,121 --> 00:26:33,454
They're the same people
in that statue, without the dog.

279
00:26:33,525 --> 00:26:34,856
They're facing each other.

280
00:26:34,926 --> 00:26:37,451
She extends her hand
to his lips...

281
00:26:37,529 --> 00:26:40,089
but from close up you'll see
she's not looking at him.

282
00:26:40,165 --> 00:26:43,066
I don't want to go there.
It's too far.

283
00:26:43,935 --> 00:26:46,199
Come with me, please.

284
00:26:46,738 --> 00:26:48,933
Please.

285
00:26:50,809 --> 00:26:52,174
I tell you it's impossible.

286
00:26:52,243 --> 00:26:54,643
I've never been
to Frederiksbad.

287
00:26:54,713 --> 00:26:57,614
Well, perhaps it was
somewhere else:

288
00:26:58,083 --> 00:27:03,612
Karlstadt, Marienbad,
or Baden-Salsa...

289
00:27:04,456 --> 00:27:06,651
or even here, in this salon.

290
00:27:06,992 --> 00:27:12,362
You have followed me here
so that I can show you this.

291
00:27:14,232 --> 00:27:16,723
You can see the man...

292
00:27:16,801 --> 00:27:19,201
and the young woman's
gesture...

293
00:27:20,438 --> 00:27:22,531
but you would have to be
on the other side...

294
00:27:22,607 --> 00:27:26,475
to see that he is stopping her.

295
00:27:26,745 --> 00:27:29,839
He has noticed something,
a danger...

296
00:27:30,181 --> 00:27:32,649
and he has raised
his arm to stop her.

297
00:27:40,692 --> 00:27:45,994
Allow me.
I can explain the statue.

298
00:27:48,433 --> 00:27:52,802
It represents Charles lll
and his wife...

299
00:27:52,937 --> 00:27:55,633
but it isn't contemporary,
of course.

300
00:27:56,307 --> 00:28:00,038
It is the oath before the Diet,
at the treason trial.

301
00:28:01,980 --> 00:28:05,711
The classical costume
is simply a convention.

302
00:28:57,235 --> 00:28:59,328
You were waiting for me.

303
00:29:04,676 --> 00:29:06,667
Why should I wait for you?

304
00:29:10,081 --> 00:29:12,982
I have myself waited
a long time for you.

305
00:29:13,318 --> 00:29:15,309
In your dreams?

306
00:29:18,923 --> 00:29:21,858
And you are trying to escape
once more.

307
00:29:22,093 --> 00:29:23,754
What do you mean?

308
00:29:24,295 --> 00:29:26,786
I don't understand
a thing you say.

309
00:29:27,365 --> 00:29:29,765
If they were dreams...

310
00:29:29,834 --> 00:29:31,825
why should you be afraid?

311
00:29:32,904 --> 00:29:35,498
Very well, tell me the rest
of our story.

312
00:29:36,941 --> 00:29:39,808
We met again in the afternoon
of that day.

313
00:29:39,878 --> 00:29:42,403
By accident, of course!

314
00:29:43,648 --> 00:29:45,513
I don't know.

315
00:29:45,583 --> 00:29:48,450
And where did we meet
this time?

316
00:29:54,225 --> 00:29:58,389
Where? That doesn't matter.

317
00:29:59,898 --> 00:30:03,493
You were with a group
of acquaintances.

318
00:30:03,568 --> 00:30:08,028
People I hardly knew;
perhaps you hardly knew them.

319
00:30:08,640 --> 00:30:13,236
They discussed some topic
I knew nothing about.

320
00:30:20,518 --> 00:30:23,715
You knew more about it than l,
probably.

321
00:30:24,556 --> 00:30:26,547
I watched you.

322
00:30:30,662 --> 00:30:34,428
Your animated conversation
struck me as false.

323
00:30:35,066 --> 00:30:38,502
It was as though none of them
knew who you were...

324
00:30:39,137 --> 00:30:41,571
as if only I knew.

325
00:30:41,639 --> 00:30:44,199
And you didn't know, either.

326
00:30:44,709 --> 00:30:47,200
You constantly avoided my eyes.

327
00:30:47,278 --> 00:30:52,375
Obviously you were doing it
deliberately.

328
00:31:02,427 --> 00:31:05,692
I waited. I had plenty of time.

329
00:31:06,598 --> 00:31:08,930
I have always thought
I had time.

330
00:31:13,738 --> 00:31:18,437
Your glance passed over me
as though I didn't exist.

331
00:31:19,544 --> 00:31:24,948
To force you to notice me,
at last I said something.

332
00:31:25,650 --> 00:31:28,380
A slightly outrageous contribution
to the discussion...

333
00:31:28,453 --> 00:31:31,217
that would turn all eyes
toward me.

334
00:31:31,289 --> 00:31:33,280
I forget what it was.

335
00:31:37,295 --> 00:31:40,287
It was you who answered me,
in the sudden silence...

336
00:31:40,365 --> 00:31:43,459
greeting my implausible remark
with irony.

337
00:31:44,903 --> 00:31:47,701
All the others remained silent.

338
00:31:47,805 --> 00:31:51,502
Again I felt that no one
understood your words.

339
00:31:53,077 --> 00:31:56,410
Perhaps I was the only one
who even heard them.

340
00:32:19,704 --> 00:32:22,832
To break the silence, someone
spoke of the entertainment...

341
00:32:22,907 --> 00:32:28,277
arranged for that evening,
or the next day, or the next.

342
00:32:28,613 --> 00:32:32,014
I forget what we said
afterwards.

343
00:33:09,354 --> 00:33:12,949
You were not fond
of walking in the park.

344
00:33:13,024 --> 00:33:15,618
Your town shoes
were not suitable for the gravel.

345
00:33:16,461 --> 00:33:20,022
Once-- maybe it was later--

346
00:33:20,098 --> 00:33:22,589
you even broke a high heel.

347
00:33:22,767 --> 00:33:27,761
You had taken my arm
while you removed the shoe.

348
00:33:28,539 --> 00:33:33,340
The heel was hanging on
by a mere shred of leather.

349
00:33:34,379 --> 00:33:36,745
You stood poised,
looking at it...

350
00:33:37,382 --> 00:33:42,149
the tip of your toe placed
before your other foot...

351
00:33:42,220 --> 00:33:44,814
like a dancer at the barre.

352
00:33:45,256 --> 00:33:49,886
You wouldn't let me fetch you
another pair of shoes.

353
00:33:49,961 --> 00:33:53,556
So I said I might carry you back

in my arms.

354
00:33:54,165 --> 00:33:58,568
You merely laughed,
without replying, as if--

355
00:34:00,138 --> 00:34:05,474
You must have walked back,
carrying your shoes.

356
00:34:18,189 --> 00:34:20,521
I met you again.

357
00:34:22,994 --> 00:34:25,428
You never seemed to be
waiting for me...

358
00:34:26,764 --> 00:34:29,562
but we kept meeting
each other...

359
00:34:30,968 --> 00:34:33,732
at each turn, each bush...

360
00:34:35,106 --> 00:34:37,165
beneath each statue...

361
00:34:38,910 --> 00:34:41,572
beside each lake.

362
00:34:43,114 --> 00:34:45,947
It was as if no one had been
in that garden...

363
00:34:47,285 --> 00:34:49,150
but you and l.

364
00:34:52,390 --> 00:34:54,881
We talked casually...

365
00:34:55,693 --> 00:34:59,789
about the names of statues,
the shape of bushes...

366
00:35:02,166 --> 00:35:04,464
the ornamental lakes.

367
00:35:06,137 --> 00:35:10,039
Or else we didn't
speak at all.

368
00:35:14,779 --> 00:35:16,508
At night, especially...

369
00:35:17,715 --> 00:35:19,706
you preferred not to talk.

370
00:35:22,753 --> 00:35:25,551
One night I came to your room.

371
00:37:13,264 --> 00:37:17,826
Always there were walls,
everywhere around me.

372
00:37:19,570 --> 00:37:25,065
Smooth, sleek, varnished,
unbroken walls.

373
00:37:26,310 --> 00:37:28,005
And the silence.

374
00:37:28,579 --> 00:37:32,310
I never heard anyone
raise his voice in this place.

375
00:37:33,851 --> 00:37:35,785
No one.

376
00:37:35,853 --> 00:37:40,517
Conversation flowed in a void
apparently meaningless...

377
00:37:40,725 --> 00:37:43,785
or, at any rate, not meant
to mean anything.

378
00:37:43,995 --> 00:37:48,261
A phrase hung in midair,
as though frozen...

379
00:37:49,900 --> 00:37:54,394
though doubtless
taken up again later.

380
00:37:56,741 --> 00:37:58,971
No matter.

381
00:37:59,143 --> 00:38:02,306
The same conversations
were always repeated...

382
00:38:02,480 --> 00:38:05,210
by the same colorless voices.

383
00:38:05,816 --> 00:38:08,341
The servants were mute.

384
00:38:08,419 --> 00:38:11,582
Games were played in silence,
of course.

385
00:38:12,423 --> 00:38:14,414
It was a place for rest.

386
00:38:14,792 --> 00:38:17,283
Business was not discussed.

387
00:38:17,361 --> 00:38:19,488
No plans were hatched.

388
00:38:19,897 --> 00:38:23,958
No one mentioned anything
that might arouse controversy.

389
00:38:26,971 --> 00:38:31,408
There were notices everywhere:
"Quiet."

390
00:39:07,111 --> 00:39:10,171
-Yes, I think I remember too.
-It's hard to believe.

391
00:39:10,247 --> 00:39:13,910
-Did you see it?
-No, a friend told me.

392
00:39:13,984 --> 00:39:17,943
We can check the weather reports
in any newspaper collection.

393
00:39:18,022 --> 00:39:20,183
Let's look in the library.

394
00:39:35,439 --> 00:39:37,964
Do you know
what I've just heard?

395
00:39:38,642 --> 00:39:41,133
At this time last year...

396
00:39:41,379 --> 00:39:45,873
it was so cold
that the lakes froze.

397
00:39:48,119 --> 00:39:50,246
That's surely wrong.

398
00:39:56,594 --> 00:40:00,928
What do you want from me?
You know it's impossible.

399
00:40:01,532 --> 00:40:05,798
One night I came to your room.

400
00:40:07,471 --> 00:40:09,564
You were alone.

401
00:40:13,644 --> 00:40:16,613
Leave me alone, please.

402
00:40:19,250 --> 00:40:21,241
It was almost summer.

403
00:40:22,219 --> 00:40:24,346
Yes, you're right...

404
00:40:24,955 --> 00:40:28,755
ice would have been
quite impossible.

405
00:40:30,928 --> 00:40:32,919
It's time for the concert.

406
00:40:33,364 --> 00:40:35,423
May I escort you?

407
00:41:10,868 --> 00:41:12,995
Are you going to the concert?

408
00:41:14,205 --> 00:41:16,833
I'll meet you later for dinner.

409
00:41:25,382 --> 00:41:29,113
This story is already over.

410
00:41:29,186 --> 00:41:32,451
A few seconds more
and it will finally be frozen...

411
00:41:32,923 --> 00:41:35,153
forever, a past in marble...

412
00:41:35,226 --> 00:41:38,252
like the garden
carved in stone...

413
00:41:38,329 --> 00:41:41,560
this mansion,
its rooms deserted now.

414
00:42:51,368 --> 00:42:54,633
Leave me alone, please.

415
00:44:44,581 --> 00:44:47,209
You never seemed
to be waiting for me...

416
00:44:48,252 --> 00:44:51,312
but we kept meeting each other
at each turn...

417
00:44:52,189 --> 00:44:56,592
each bush, beneath each statue...

418
00:44:56,894 --> 00:44:58,885
beside each lake.

419
00:44:59,463 --> 00:45:02,091
As if no one had been
in that garden...

420
00:45:03,267 --> 00:45:05,258
but you and l.

421
00:45:07,071 --> 00:45:11,201
We talked casually,
about the names of statues...

422
00:45:11,375 --> 00:45:15,209
the shape of bushes,
the ornamental lakes...

423
00:45:15,879 --> 00:45:18,109
the color of the sky.

424
00:45:18,482 --> 00:45:21,007
Or else we didn't speak
at all.

425
00:45:55,319 --> 00:46:01,155
But you held back,
as if on the threshold...

426
00:46:02,392 --> 00:46:06,624
as if at the entrance
to a place too dark, too strange.

427
00:46:10,768 --> 00:46:12,702
Come nearer.

428
00:46:22,079 --> 00:46:24,047
Nearer still.

429
00:46:38,061 --> 00:46:40,723
Leave me alone, please.

430
00:46:46,270 --> 00:46:50,502
Always walls, corridors,
always doors...

431
00:46:51,241 --> 00:46:54,108
and on the other side,
yet more walls.

432
00:46:54,344 --> 00:46:57,211
Before reaching you,
  
rejoining you...

433
00:46:57,981 --> 00:47:01,246
you had no idea
what had to be gone through.

434
00:47:02,653 --> 00:47:06,521
And now you are here,
where I have brought you.

435
00:47:06,590 --> 00:47:09,684
You are still hesitant,
but you are here, in the garden...

436
00:47:09,760 --> 00:47:15,756
within sight, touch, hearing--

437
00:47:19,069 --> 00:47:22,163
-Who are you?
-You know.

438
00:47:23,774 --> 00:47:25,708
What is your name?

439
00:47:25,776 --> 00:47:28,540
You know it doesn't matter.

440
00:47:29,246 --> 00:47:31,908
It doesn't matter.

441
00:47:33,684 --> 00:47:35,675
You're like a shadow...

442
00:47:36,687 --> 00:47:39,178
waiting for me to come closer.

443
00:47:41,158 --> 00:47:42,819
Leave me alone.

444
00:47:53,203 --> 00:47:55,637
It is already too late.

445
00:47:57,207 --> 00:48:00,005
You asked me
not to see you again.

446
00:48:00,811 --> 00:48:03,006
We did see each other,
of course...

447
00:48:03,247 --> 00:48:05,977
the next day,
or the day after...

448
00:48:06,049 --> 00:48:07,983
or the day after that.

449
00:48:09,152 --> 00:48:11,313
It may have been by chance.

450
00:48:11,922 --> 00:48:14,755
I told you that you must leave
with me.

451
00:48:15,292 --> 00:48:18,955
You said it was impossible,
of course.

452
00:48:19,696 --> 00:48:21,687
But you know it's possible.

453
00:48:21,765 --> 00:48:25,428
It's all you can do now.

454
00:48:26,270 --> 00:48:29,330
Y es, perhaps.

455
00:48:30,540 --> 00:48:33,566
No, I don't know anymore.

456
00:48:34,244 --> 00:48:37,771
Why me?
Why does it have to be me?

457
00:48:37,981 --> 00:48:40,176
You were waiting for me.

458
00:48:40,417 --> 00:48:44,820
No, I wasn't.
I wasn't waiting for anyone.

459
00:48:44,888 --> 00:48:47,083
You were waiting for nothing.

460
00:48:47,157 --> 00:48:49,022
You were as though dead.

461
00:48:50,160 --> 00:48:52,151
That's not true.

462
00:48:52,229 --> 00:48:54,220
You are alive still.

463
00:48:54,998 --> 00:48:58,331
You are here. I see you.

464
00:49:00,137 --> 00:49:02,469
Do you remember?

465
00:49:05,008 --> 00:49:08,444
It's not true... probably.

466
00:49:08,512 --> 00:49:11,037
You've already forgotten
everything.

467
00:49:12,516 --> 00:49:15,110
It's not true.

468
00:49:15,252 --> 00:49:18,380
You're about to leave.
The door of your room is still open.

469
00:49:18,455 --> 00:49:21,788
Why? What do you hope
to make of me?

470
00:49:21,858 --> 00:49:24,554
What sort of life
will you have me lead?

471
00:49:24,628 --> 00:49:26,619
It's not a question
of another life.

472
00:49:27,831 --> 00:49:31,028
It's a question of yours.

473
00:49:33,236 --> 00:49:35,101
Remember.

474
00:49:36,006 --> 00:49:39,464
It was evening,
probably the last one.

475
00:49:40,010 --> 00:49:42,205
It was almost dark.

476
00:49:42,579 --> 00:49:47,039
A vague shadow approached
slowly through the gloom.

477
00:49:48,018 --> 00:49:51,510
Long before I could distinguish
your face...

478
00:49:52,422 --> 00:49:54,947
I knew it was you.

479
00:49:55,792 --> 00:49:58,886
You stopped
when you recognized me.

480
00:49:59,096 --> 00:50:02,395
We stood like that, apart...

481
00:50:03,200 --> 00:50:05,191
without speaking.

482
00:50:05,769 --> 00:50:09,296
You stood right in front of me...

483
00:50:09,806 --> 00:50:12,001
waiting, perhaps...

484
00:50:12,776 --> 00:50:16,576
as if you couldn't move
in any direction.

485
00:50:19,149 --> 00:50:22,676
You stood there, stiff...

486
00:50:23,754 --> 00:50:25,449
motionless...

487
00:50:26,456 --> 00:50:28,515
arms at your sides...

488
00:50:31,128 --> 00:50:33,562
looking at me.

489
00:50:34,297 --> 00:50:37,460
Your eyes wide open-- too wide--

490
00:50:37,534 --> 00:50:41,436
lips parted as if to speak...

491
00:50:41,505 --> 00:50:43,973
or groan... or scream.

492
00:50:44,508 --> 00:50:46,703
You are afraid.

493
00:50:46,777 --> 00:50:49,211
Your mouth opens still more...

494
00:50:49,279 --> 00:50:51,304
your eyes widen...

495
00:50:51,782 --> 00:50:57,084
your hand is extended
expectantly, uncertainly...

496
00:50:57,621 --> 00:51:01,557
or perhaps appealingly,
or defensively.

497
00:51:01,925 --> 00:51:03,586
Your fingers tremble slightly.

498
00:51:04,694 --> 00:51:06,525
You are afraid.

499
00:51:22,145 --> 00:51:24,136
Who is he?

500
00:51:25,015 --> 00:51:28,451
Your husband... perhaps.

501
00:51:29,619 --> 00:51:31,610
He was looking for you...

502
00:51:32,122 --> 00:51:34,522
or maybe just passing by.

503
00:51:35,892 --> 00:51:38,690
He was coming to you.

504
00:51:39,896 --> 00:51:41,693
But you remained motionless...

505
00:51:41,765 --> 00:51:44,859
withdrawn... far away.

506
00:51:46,369 --> 00:51:49,338
He felt he didn't quite

recognize you.

507
00:51:50,173 --> 00:51:52,164
He stepped nearer.

508
00:51:52,776 --> 00:51:55,210
Something in you evaded him.

509
00:51:55,679 --> 00:51:58,307
He took another step nearer.

510
00:51:58,815 --> 00:52:01,716
You looked through him.

511
00:52:03,420 --> 00:52:06,184
He decided to go away.

512
00:52:06,690 --> 00:52:08,453
And now...

513
00:52:08,859 --> 00:52:11,851
you are still staring into space...

514
00:52:12,696 --> 00:52:15,358
and you still see him.

515
00:52:16,099 --> 00:52:18,090
His gray eyes...

516
00:52:19,536 --> 00:52:22,061
his gray silhouette...

517
00:52:24,007 --> 00:52:26,168
and his smile.

518
00:52:33,817 --> 00:52:36,047
And you are afraid.

519
00:52:37,220 --> 00:52:39,745
You fear he may come again...

520
00:52:39,823 --> 00:52:41,814
or that he's already here...

521
00:52:41,892 --> 00:52:44,759
when I come once again
to your room.

522
00:52:45,061 --> 00:52:48,724
His room and yours
are separated by a sitting room.

523
00:52:49,299 --> 00:52:52,234
Anyway, he'll be in the gaming room
at this hour.

524
00:52:52,402 --> 00:52:55,997
I told you I would come.
You made no reply.

525
00:52:56,840 --> 00:52:59,274
I found all the doors ajar:

526
00:52:59,342 --> 00:53:02,277
the door to the suite,
to the sitting room...

527
00:53:02,345 --> 00:53:04,006
to your room.

528
00:53:04,080 --> 00:53:06,378
I had only to push them open...

529
00:53:06,449 --> 00:53:09,577
and close them behind me,
one after the other.

530
00:53:11,488 --> 00:53:13,479
You know what happened then.

531
00:53:18,094 --> 00:53:20,426
I don't know what happened.
I don't know you...

532
00:53:20,664 --> 00:53:23,895
or that room, that bed,
that mirror over the fireplace--

533
00:53:23,967 --> 00:53:27,801
What mirror? What fireplace?

534
00:53:29,306 --> 00:53:32,867
I don't know anymore.
It's all wrong.

535
00:53:32,943 --> 00:53:36,037
If it's wrong,
why are you here?

536
00:53:39,282 --> 00:53:40,943
What was the mirror like?

537
00:53:41,017 --> 00:53:43,508
There's no mirror
over the fireplace.

538
00:53:44,221 --> 00:53:46,086
There's a painting.

539
00:53:46,690 --> 00:53:50,091
A landscape, I think.
A snow scene.

540
00:53:50,994 --> 00:53:53,485
The mirror is
on the chest of drawers.

541
00:53:54,998 --> 00:53:57,796
There's a mirror
on the dressing table too.

542
00:53:58,134 --> 00:54:03,299
And there's other furniture,
too, of course.

543
00:54:04,074 --> 00:54:06,065
What sort of bed?

544
00:54:06,142 --> 00:54:08,269
A double bed, probably.

545
00:54:08,678 --> 00:54:11,169
What was the view
from the window?

546
00:54:11,281 --> 00:54:14,648
I don't know. The window--

547
00:54:15,518 --> 00:54:19,079
What room? I've never been
in any room with you.

548
00:54:19,155 --> 00:54:22,784
You don't want to remember,
because you're afraid.

549
00:54:23,560 --> 00:54:27,121
Don't you recognize
this photograph, either?

550
00:54:31,067 --> 00:54:32,466
I don't know.
I don't remember--

551
00:54:32,535 --> 00:54:35,265
-You know who took it.
-You're lying.

552
00:54:35,338 --> 00:54:38,330
You know it was last year.
I begged you to let me take it.

553
00:54:38,408 --> 00:54:41,036
You said you would feel
embarrassed.

554
00:54:41,444 --> 00:54:44,174
Yes, I was right.

555
00:54:45,515 --> 00:54:49,918
I well remember that room...

556
00:54:49,986 --> 00:54:51,977
where you waited for me.

557
00:54:52,555 --> 00:54:56,821
Yes, there was a mirror
over the chest of drawers.

558
00:54:57,160 --> 00:54:59,993
I saw you in that mirror...

559
00:55:00,063 --> 00:55:02,827
when I silently opened the door.

560
00:55:03,700 --> 00:55:09,661
You were sitting on the bed,
wearing a white robe or gown.

561
00:55:09,739 --> 00:55:11,934
You were all in white,
white slippers too...

562
00:55:12,008 --> 00:55:13,669
wearing this ring.

563
00:55:13,743 --> 00:55:16,541
I'm sure
you're making it all up.

564
00:55:16,646 --> 00:55:19,513
I never had a white robe.

565
00:55:19,582 --> 00:55:21,846
You're thinking
of someone else.

566
00:55:22,786 --> 00:55:24,413
If you say so.

567
00:55:24,487 --> 00:55:29,288
I remember that you were lying
among white feathers--

568
00:55:29,359 --> 00:55:32,760
No! Stop it, please.

569
00:55:32,829 --> 00:55:34,854
You're completely mad.

570
00:55:35,265 --> 00:55:38,257
"No, please!"

571
00:55:39,569 --> 00:55:41,833
I can still hear your voice.

572
00:55:43,273 --> 00:55:45,264
You were afraid then.

573
00:55:48,645 --> 00:55:52,445
You were afraid,
but I loved your fear that evening.

574
00:55:54,451 --> 00:55:56,282
I watched you...

575
00:55:56,820 --> 00:55:59,186
letting you struggle a little.

576
00:55:59,522 --> 00:56:01,752
I loved you.

577
00:56:03,660 --> 00:56:05,992
There was something

in your eyes.

578
00:56:06,062 --> 00:56:08,656
You were so alive.

579
00:56:09,332 --> 00:56:12,927
And then... at first...

580
00:56:14,304 --> 00:56:16,898
remember.

581
00:56:17,941 --> 00:56:20,000
No...

582
00:56:20,944 --> 00:56:23,174
probably it wasn't by force.

583
00:56:28,818 --> 00:56:31,878
But only you know that.

584
00:57:24,407 --> 00:57:27,501
-What is it?
-Nothing.

585
00:57:29,512 --> 00:57:33,608
-Are you tired?
-Yes, a little, I think.

586
00:57:33,883 --> 00:57:36,613
The sun... so suddenly--

587
00:57:37,420 --> 00:57:40,685
Would you like to go in?

588
00:57:41,958 --> 00:57:43,983
If you want to.

589
00:59:30,166 --> 00:59:33,192
I took the photograph
that day.

590
00:59:34,304 --> 00:59:37,364
And you asked me
to give you a year...

591
00:59:38,708 --> 00:59:41,404
to put me to the test, perhaps...

592
00:59:42,612 --> 00:59:44,307
or to weary me...

593
00:59:45,181 --> 00:59:47,877
or so that you could forget me.

594
00:59:48,751 --> 00:59:52,551
But time means nothing.

595
00:59:53,256 --> 00:59:56,089
I've come to find you.

596
01:00:03,499 --> 01:00:05,126
No, it's impossible.

597
01:00:05,201 --> 01:00:09,194
"No, it's impossible."

598
01:00:10,406 --> 01:00:14,604
You say that,
but you know it is possible...

599
01:00:15,044 --> 01:00:17,706
that you're ready,
that we're going to leave.

600
01:00:19,549 --> 01:00:21,813
How are you so sure?

601
01:00:21,884 --> 01:00:23,875
Where will we go?

602
01:00:23,953 --> 01:00:26,854
Anywhere. I don't know.

603
01:00:26,923 --> 01:00:31,485
It's best if we never
see each other again.

604
01:00:32,028 --> 01:00:35,555
Last year--
No, it's impossible.

605
01:00:37,200 --> 01:00:38,792
You'll leave alone...

606
01:00:40,169 --> 01:00:41,636
and then we'll be forever--

607
01:00:41,704 --> 01:00:43,501
It's not true!

608
01:00:43,840 --> 01:00:46,001
We don't need to be apart...

609
01:00:46,075 --> 01:00:48,270
alone, eternally waiting.

610
01:00:48,344 --> 01:00:50,039
It's not true.

611
01:00:51,514 --> 01:00:53,345
But you're afraid.

612
01:01:01,157 --> 01:01:03,489
It's too late now.

613
01:01:09,632 --> 01:01:11,998
He had left your room.

614
01:01:12,568 --> 01:01:16,868
Some violent scene had just
taken place between you.

615
01:01:54,010 --> 01:01:57,104
Your window looked out
onto the garden...

616
01:01:57,180 --> 01:02:01,776
but you didn't have the reassurance
of seeing him leave.

617
01:02:02,785 --> 01:02:05,618
You turned to the bed,
undecided...

618
01:02:05,688 --> 01:02:07,883
uncertain where to go.

619
01:02:07,957 --> 01:02:11,393
You turned to the bed,
you sat down on it...

620
01:02:12,628 --> 01:02:16,223
you fell back on it.

621
01:02:17,600 --> 01:02:20,034
You turned to the bed...

622
01:02:23,372 --> 01:02:29,174
after having stood undecided
for a few moments...

623
01:02:29,679 --> 01:02:33,479
staring vacantly ahead.

624
01:02:38,121 --> 01:02:41,090
You turned to the bed.

625
01:02:43,059 --> 01:02:47,018
Listen to me! Remember!

626
01:02:47,964 --> 01:02:50,558
Listen, please!

627
01:02:51,367 --> 01:02:53,699
Yes, there was--

628
01:02:54,303 --> 01:02:57,932
True, there was a huge mirror
just by the door...

629
01:02:58,007 --> 01:03:02,671
which you seemed to be afraid
to go near.

630
01:03:05,381 --> 01:03:08,748
But you will pretend
not to believe me.

631
01:03:08,818 --> 01:03:11,719
Where have you gone?

632
01:03:11,788 --> 01:03:15,383
Why do you always want
to escape? It's too late.

633
01:03:15,458 --> 01:03:18,393
It was already too late--

634
01:03:18,461 --> 01:03:19,985
The door was closed now.

635
01:03:20,496 --> 01:03:22,487
No, the door was closed!

636
01:03:29,205 --> 01:03:32,868
Listen, what more proof
do you need?

637
01:03:34,777 --> 01:03:36,768
I kept a photograph of you...

638
01:03:36,846 --> 01:03:39,974
taken one afternoon in the park
a few days before you left.

639
01:03:40,683 --> 01:03:44,779
But when I showed it to you,
you said it proved nothing.

640
01:03:45,054 --> 01:03:48,820
You said anybody might have
taken the photograph...

641
01:03:49,458 --> 01:03:52,450
that it could be any garden.

642
01:03:53,896 --> 01:03:57,627
I should have shown you
set among white feathers...

643
01:03:57,700 --> 01:04:00,225
a sea of white feathers
about your body.

644
01:04:01,070 --> 01:04:04,528
But all bodies,
all feathered robes, look alike...

645
01:04:04,607 --> 01:04:07,440
like all hotels, statues, gardens...

646
01:04:08,711 --> 01:04:13,011
but not that unique garden...

647
01:04:13,082 --> 01:04:16,609
where I found you every day.

648
01:04:23,659 --> 01:04:25,320
It is one afternoon--

649
01:04:25,761 --> 01:04:28,059
the next day, probably--

650
01:04:30,166 --> 01:04:32,464
I have come to say
we are leaving.

651
01:04:32,535 --> 01:04:34,867
No, you weren't laughing.

652
01:04:35,204 --> 01:04:37,764
We will leave for good
the next morning--

653
01:04:41,577 --> 01:04:43,169
That's not it.

654
01:04:43,246 --> 01:04:46,511
Yes, we were in your room.

655
01:04:46,582 --> 01:04:49,312
We must have agreed to leave--

656
01:04:49,385 --> 01:04:52,354
you reluctantly, perhaps.

657
01:04:53,055 --> 01:04:55,489
I was in your room.

658
01:04:56,225 --> 01:04:58,716
From the door,
one sees the bed first...

659
01:04:59,962 --> 01:05:02,795
but the dressing table
was out of sight.

660
01:05:03,299 --> 01:05:06,200
You were probably
by the window...

661
01:05:06,269 --> 01:05:08,794
looking out on the garden.

662
01:05:09,138 --> 01:05:11,436
I can't remember exactly.

663
01:05:11,741 --> 01:05:14,505
He had passed me on the stairs...

664
01:05:14,577 --> 01:05:16,807
after he left you.

665
01:05:17,246 --> 01:05:19,806
Unless that was another day.

666
01:05:20,783 --> 01:05:24,184
The place was deserted
that night...

667
01:05:24,687 --> 01:05:26,177
stairs...

668
01:05:26,956 --> 01:05:28,446
corridors...

669
01:05:29,125 --> 01:05:30,717
stairs.

670
01:06:25,181 --> 01:06:29,845
No, I don't remember anymore.

671
01:06:30,920 --> 01:06:33,150
I don't remember anymore
myself.

672
01:06:35,658 --> 01:06:37,421
I don't remember.

673
01:06:44,967 --> 01:06:47,663
I knocked. Didn't you hear?

674
01:06:48,270 --> 01:06:51,296
Yes. I said, "Come in."

675
01:06:54,844 --> 01:06:57,005
You couldn't have said it
very loudly.

676
01:07:23,539 --> 01:07:25,905
What is the photograph?

677
01:07:26,242 --> 01:07:29,734
As you can see,
it's an old photograph of me.

678
01:07:32,081 --> 01:07:35,744
-When was it taken?
-I don't know. Last year.

679
01:07:37,686 --> 01:07:42,487
-Who took it?
-I don't know. Frank, maybe.

680
01:07:43,192 --> 01:07:47,185
Frank wasn't here last year.

681
01:07:54,103 --> 01:07:57,368
Well, perhaps it wasn't
taken here.

682
01:07:57,606 --> 01:08:00,541
Perhaps it was taken
at Frederiksbad.

683
01:08:01,777 --> 01:08:03,870
Or perhaps it was
someone else.

684
01:08:03,946 --> 01:08:05,436
Yes, perhaps.

685
01:08:08,684 --> 01:08:10,743
What did you do
this afternoon?

686
01:08:11,087 --> 01:08:13,681
Nothing. I read.

687
01:08:15,891 --> 01:08:18,917
I looked for you.
Were you in the park?

688
01:08:18,994 --> 01:08:22,395
No, in the green salon,
near the music room.

689
01:08:24,834 --> 01:08:27,530
I didn't see you there.

690
01:08:27,603 --> 01:08:29,594
Did you have something
to tell me?

691
01:08:37,246 --> 01:08:41,410
-You look upset.
-I'm rather tired.

692
01:08:41,484 --> 01:08:45,784
You should rest.
After all, that's why we're here.

693
01:08:50,126 --> 01:08:52,117
Are you going out?

694
01:08:52,194 --> 01:08:54,458
I think I'll go
to the shooting gallery.

695
01:08:54,530 --> 01:08:57,693
-At this hour?
-Why not?

696
01:08:59,602 --> 01:09:01,593
Anderson arrives tomorrow.

697
01:09:01,670 --> 01:09:03,763
We'll have lunch with him...

698
01:09:03,839 --> 01:09:06,171
if you have no other plans.

699
01:09:07,977 --> 01:09:11,071
Of course not.
What other plans?

700
01:09:11,147 --> 01:09:13,377
Until this evening, then.

701
01:09:21,590 --> 01:09:26,527
After the door closed,
you tried to hear him leave...

702
01:09:26,829 --> 01:09:31,766
but there was no sound,
no other doors closed.

703
01:09:32,801 --> 01:09:37,898
His quickest way to the gallery
lay under your window.

704
01:09:38,207 --> 01:09:42,906
But you can't see the path
without opening the window.

705
01:09:43,946 --> 01:09:46,414
You listened for his steps
on the gravel...

706
01:09:46,482 --> 01:09:49,883
but you couldn't hear
through the window...

707
01:09:50,119 --> 01:09:53,555
and there's probably no gravel,
anyway.

708
01:10:29,992 --> 01:10:34,122
One arm is half-bent
towards the hair...

709
01:10:34,196 --> 01:10:38,064
the other hand rests on the chin,
finger to mouth...

710
01:10:39,235 --> 01:10:41,795
as though to stifle a cry.

711
01:10:47,209 --> 01:10:49,939
And now you are here
once more.

712
01:10:53,782 --> 01:10:58,947
No, that ending is not right.
I need you alive.

713
01:11:00,556 --> 01:11:03,423
Alive, as you were then...

714
01:11:03,525 --> 01:11:07,154
every evening, for weeks,
for months.

715
01:11:11,600 --> 01:11:14,626
I have never stayed
so long anywhere.

716
01:11:14,703 --> 01:11:17,331
Yes, I know.

717
01:11:25,581 --> 01:11:27,515
I don't care.

718
01:11:27,583 --> 01:11:30,643
For days and days--

719
01:11:35,057 --> 01:11:37,423
Why don't you want to?

720
01:11:38,694 --> 01:11:40,992
Why won't you remember?

721
01:11:42,731 --> 01:11:45,393
You're insane.

722
01:11:45,634 --> 01:11:49,502
I'm tired. Leave me alone.

723
01:14:24,193 --> 01:14:26,559
-It's a silly game!
-You have to know the trick.

724
01:14:26,628 --> 01:14:30,291
-Simply take an odd number.
-There must be rules.

725
01:14:30,365 --> 01:14:32,026
The beginner always loses.

726
01:14:32,100 --> 01:14:34,261
I'm sure Frank played that game
last year.

727
01:14:36,205 --> 01:14:39,038
You must work on a basis
of sevens.

728
01:14:39,107 --> 01:14:40,574
Which row?

729
01:14:42,044 --> 01:14:44,877
Begin now, please.

730
01:14:44,947 --> 01:14:48,439
With pleasure.
Which would you like me to take?

731
01:14:52,721 --> 01:14:54,211
This one.

732
01:15:13,208 --> 01:15:16,439
Well, I've lost.

733
01:15:25,954 --> 01:15:28,445
The beginner always wins.

734
01:15:28,957 --> 01:15:31,255
Simply take an even number.

735
01:15:31,827 --> 01:15:33,954
The smallest odd number.

736
01:15:34,029 --> 01:15:37,089
It is a logarithmic series.

737
01:15:37,165 --> 01:15:39,463
One must change row
each time.

738
01:16:21,209 --> 01:16:24,736
That's wrong.
It wasn't by force.

739
01:16:25,914 --> 01:16:27,779
Remember.

740
01:16:28,383 --> 01:16:32,319
For days and days, every night--

741
01:16:33,088 --> 01:16:35,283
All the rooms are identical...

742
01:16:35,490 --> 01:16:39,984
but for me,
that room looked like no other.

743
01:16:40,062 --> 01:16:45,864
There were no more doors,
no corridors, hotel or garden.

744
01:16:46,568 --> 01:16:48,798
Not even a garden.

745
01:17:30,979 --> 01:17:33,174
In the middle of the night...

746
01:17:33,248 --> 01:17:35,341
nothing stirred in the hotel.

747
01:17:35,684 --> 01:17:39,677
We found ourselves
in the grounds, as before.

748
01:17:40,789 --> 01:17:43,451
You stopped
when you recognized me.

749
01:17:44,026 --> 01:17:47,621
We stood like that, apart,
without speaking.

750
01:17:49,564 --> 01:17:52,590
You stood right in front of me...

751
01:17:53,001 --> 01:17:56,402
as if you couldn't move
in any direction.

752
01:17:57,939 --> 01:18:01,568
You stood there, stiff,
motionless...

753
01:18:01,810 --> 01:18:03,641
arms at your sides...

754
01:18:03,812 --> 01:18:08,010
enveloped in some kind
of long, dark cape.

755
01:18:08,817 --> 01:18:10,876
Black, perhaps.

756
01:18:14,623 --> 01:18:16,318
Listen, please.

757
01:18:16,391 --> 01:18:19,053
We can't turn back now.

758
01:18:20,662 --> 01:18:23,187
All I ask is
that you wait a little.

759
01:18:23,432 --> 01:18:26,162
Here, next year, the same time...

760
01:18:27,669 --> 01:18:29,261
I'll go anywhere with you.

761
01:18:29,337 --> 01:18:31,532
Why delay now?

762
01:18:31,606 --> 01:18:34,769
Please, we must.

763
01:18:35,577 --> 01:18:37,909
A year isn't much.

764
01:18:38,013 --> 01:18:41,915
No, for me it's nothing.

765
01:18:42,150 --> 01:18:43,276
But, listen--

766
01:18:43,351 --> 01:18:46,377
It seems you need more time.
Until when?

767
01:18:47,355 --> 01:18:48,617
I'm telling you.

768
01:18:48,690 --> 01:18:51,659
-I've waited so long.
-Not so loud, please.

769
01:18:51,727 --> 01:18:55,527
Why should we be
so circumspect?

770
01:18:55,597 --> 01:18:58,498
Do you think it's so easy?

771
01:19:00,836 --> 01:19:02,997
I don't know.

772
01:19:04,106 --> 01:19:06,199
And, besides...

773
01:19:07,542 --> 01:19:10,102
I'm not very brave.

774
01:19:11,847 --> 01:19:14,042
You can't put it off again.

775
01:19:15,684 --> 01:19:19,120
I'm only asking for a few hours,
that's all.

776
01:19:21,690 --> 01:19:25,057
A few months, a few hours...

777
01:19:25,127 --> 01:19:26,822
a few minutes...

778
01:19:27,129 --> 01:19:29,597
a few seconds more...

779
01:19:29,831 --> 01:19:32,595
as if you still had doubts...

780
01:19:32,667 --> 01:19:34,726
about separating from him...

781
01:19:35,637 --> 01:19:37,571
from yourself...

782
01:19:38,240 --> 01:19:40,231
as if you were his shadow.

783
01:19:40,308 --> 01:19:44,711
Someone's coming.
Be quiet, please!

784
01:19:57,392 --> 01:20:00,555
Go away,
if you really love me.

785
01:20:46,041 --> 01:20:49,738
A slight indisposition,
no doubt?

786
01:20:49,945 --> 01:20:52,311
Yes, it's nothing.

787
01:20:53,248 --> 01:20:55,011
You're feeling better?

788
01:20:55,083 --> 01:20:57,643
Yes, I'm going to my room.

789
01:20:57,719 --> 01:20:59,516
Shall I come with you?

790
01:21:01,489 --> 01:21:05,289
I'd rather be alone.
I'll go now.

791
01:21:26,014 --> 01:21:30,417
Once more I advanced
along these same corridors...

792
01:21:30,752 --> 01:21:33,880
for days... months...

793
01:21:33,955 --> 01:21:36,890
years... to meet you.

794
01:21:37,325 --> 01:21:41,284
There would be no pause,
no rest between these walls.

795
01:21:42,163 --> 01:21:46,327
I will leave tonight,
taking you with me.

796
01:21:54,075 --> 01:21:57,067
It must be a year
since this story began.

797
01:21:57,779 --> 01:22:01,875
A year of waiting for you,
you for me.

798
01:22:05,220 --> 01:22:10,453
You couldn't have endured
this trompe l'oeil style...

799
01:22:11,092 --> 01:22:13,788
among these mirrors
and columns...

800
01:22:14,362 --> 01:22:18,458
these doors ever ajar,
stairways too immense...

801
01:22:19,000 --> 01:22:21,867
this ever open room.

802
01:22:33,415 --> 01:22:35,747
Where are you, my lost love?

803
01:22:37,385 --> 01:22:43,324
I am here with you,
in this room.

804
01:22:43,858 --> 01:22:47,316
No, that's no longer true.

805
01:22:50,732 --> 01:22:54,190
Help me, I beseech you.

806
01:22:56,037 --> 01:22:57,698
Give me your hand.

807
01:22:57,772 --> 01:22:59,865
Yes, you felt better.

808
01:23:01,209 --> 01:23:04,440
Yes, you'll go to sleep now.

809
01:23:05,413 --> 01:23:08,712
Yes, you will be quite well
before Ackerson arrives...

810
01:23:09,284 --> 01:23:13,220
or Patterson, or whoever
you're lunching with tomorrow.

811
01:23:13,288 --> 01:23:15,313
Don't let me leave.

812
01:23:15,390 --> 01:23:17,688
You know it's too late.

813
01:23:19,227 --> 01:23:22,321
Tomorrow I'll be alone.

814
01:23:23,264 --> 01:23:25,926
I'll open the door
to your empty room.

815
01:23:27,635 --> 01:23:29,125
I'm cold.

816
01:23:32,007 --> 01:23:34,567
No, you don't need anything.

817
01:23:35,010 --> 01:23:38,605
You don't know
what came over you downstairs.

818
01:23:39,414 --> 01:23:42,508
You have no clear recollection
of it.

819
01:23:43,885 --> 01:23:47,719
You hope your cry
didn't cause a sensation.

820
01:23:52,394 --> 01:23:55,591
Once he had gone-- this man
who may be your husband...

821
01:23:55,663 --> 01:23:57,597
whom you perhaps love...

822
01:23:57,665 --> 01:24:01,567
who doesn't know
you're leaving him--

823
01:24:02,237 --> 01:24:06,367
you packed and prepared
a quick change of clothes.

824
01:24:07,842 --> 01:24:10,504
We agreed to leave
during the night.

825
01:24:10,812 --> 01:24:15,476
But it seemed you wanted
to give him one more chance.

826
01:24:16,451 --> 01:24:19,909
I don't know. I agreed.

827
01:24:20,121 --> 01:24:23,750
He should have come.
He could have taken you back.

828
01:24:26,094 --> 01:24:28,756
The hotel seemed abandoned.

829
01:24:29,197 --> 01:24:33,031
Everyone was attending
the long-awaited performance...

830
01:24:33,368 --> 01:24:35,962
from which your indisposition
excused you.

831
01:24:36,571 --> 01:24:38,698
It was, I think--

832
01:24:38,773 --> 01:24:40,798
I've forgotten the title now.

833
01:24:41,543 --> 01:24:44,239
The play wouldn't end
until very late.

834
01:24:44,979 --> 01:24:48,210
After having left you
lying in your room...

835
01:24:48,283 --> 01:24:52,583
he went to the theater
to join his friends.

836
01:24:53,655 --> 01:24:56,647
He should have left the play...

837
01:24:56,724 --> 01:24:59,215
if he really wanted
to keep you.

838
01:25:03,264 --> 01:25:08,964
You were dressed, ready to leave,
and you began to wait, alone...

839
01:25:09,304 --> 01:25:14,571
in a sort of hall
on the way to your suite.

840
01:25:15,443 --> 01:25:19,106
For some reason, you asked me
to wait till midnight.

841
01:25:20,715 --> 01:25:23,377
I don't know
whether you hoped he'd come.

842
01:25:23,952 --> 01:25:28,082
I even thought for a moment
you'd told him everything...

843
01:25:28,156 --> 01:25:30,852
and arranged for him
to meet you.

844
01:25:31,626 --> 01:25:35,858
Or perhaps you merely thought
I wouldn't come.

845
01:25:41,769 --> 01:25:45,205
I came at the agreed time.

846
01:27:49,063 --> 01:27:53,227
The grounds of that mansion
were rather in the French style...

847
01:27:54,102 --> 01:27:59,233
without trees, flowers,
or any plants at all.

848
01:28:00,275 --> 01:28:03,870
Gravel, stone, marble...

849
01:28:03,945 --> 01:28:08,109
rectilinear, formal...

850
01:28:08,182 --> 01:28:10,810
devoid of mystery.

851
01:28:11,519 --> 01:28:13,384
At first glance...

852
01:28:13,454 --> 01:28:18,016
it seemed impossible
to get lost in them...

853
01:28:18,092 --> 01:28:20,322
along the straight paths...

854
01:28:20,395 --> 01:28:24,456
between the immutable statues,
granite slabs...

855
01:28:24,532 --> 01:28:28,366
where you were, even now...

856
01:28:28,436 --> 01:28:32,202
losing yourself forever...

857
01:28:32,640 --> 01:28:34,870
in the still night...

858
01:28:34,942 --> 01:28:37,911
alone with me.

859
01:28:40,181 --> 01:28:43,708
THE END
