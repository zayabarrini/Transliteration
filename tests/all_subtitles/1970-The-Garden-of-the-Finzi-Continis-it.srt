1
00:03:22,510 --> 00:03:24,327
Is anyone there?

2
00:03:24,412 --> 00:03:26,996
Micol must be up
to one of her tricks!

3
00:03:27,081 --> 00:03:29,932
- Did Alberto or Micol phone?
- Micol.

4
00:03:30,017 --> 00:03:32,769
- What a stupid joke!
- I was only fooling.

5
00:03:32,854 --> 00:03:34,671
They're much too well-bred.

6
00:03:34,756 --> 00:03:36,973
Maybe so,
but they're still not here.

7
00:03:37,058 --> 00:03:40,755
- Is anyone there?
- Yes, I'm coming!

8
00:03:43,064 --> 00:03:46,693
- Race you to the entrance!
- Don't leave me behind!

9
00:03:51,072 --> 00:03:52,989
They're coming back.

10
00:03:53,074 --> 00:03:56,659
We've waited so long,
I began to think they'd gone away.

11
00:03:56,744 --> 00:04:00,009
No, the Finzi-Continis
never leave their kingdom.

12
00:04:00,548 --> 00:04:04,109
The house must be
a long way from the gate.

13
00:04:04,519 --> 00:04:06,714
Come in!

14
00:04:13,494 --> 00:04:16,088
Straight ahead.
You can't miss it.

15
00:04:16,597 --> 00:04:18,614
- What's that?
- A monster!

16
00:04:18,699 --> 00:04:20,216
Does he bite?

17
00:04:20,301 --> 00:04:23,566
With four teeth left,
what can he bite...

18
00:04:23,738 --> 00:04:26,172
except corn mush?

19
00:04:29,343 --> 00:04:32,608
- He's so damn big!
- He looks like a horse.

20
00:04:34,148 --> 00:04:36,899
I thought the palace
only invited you...

21
00:04:36,984 --> 00:04:39,435
but a lot of us were honored.

22
00:04:39,520 --> 00:04:42,489
We can thank our Fascists
for the privilege.

23
00:04:43,357 --> 00:04:46,258
Nice to see you loving as ever.
Engaged yet?

24
00:04:46,727 --> 00:04:49,479
- When will you be, Giorgio?
- To whom?

25
00:04:49,564 --> 00:04:51,191
Everyone knows to whom.

26
00:04:53,034 --> 00:04:55,118
Been in Ferrara long?

27
00:04:55,203 --> 00:04:57,019
No, about a month.

28
00:04:57,104 --> 00:05:00,403
But I don't get out much,
like Alberto.

29
00:05:01,042 --> 00:05:04,026
- Do you know Micol too?
- No. What's she like?

30
00:05:04,111 --> 00:05:06,562
Very beautiful: tall, blond...

31
00:05:06,647 --> 00:05:08,740
but unpredictable.

32
00:05:36,344 --> 00:05:37,743
That way!

33
00:05:54,428 --> 00:05:56,589
Here we are!

34
00:06:01,602 --> 00:06:04,127
Come on, Alberto.
They're here!

35
00:06:07,408 --> 00:06:09,158
You lunatic-- I'll fall!

36
00:06:09,243 --> 00:06:11,803
There's our Micol!
There she is!

37
00:06:25,226 --> 00:06:29,111
My brother and I decided
to hold our own tournament here...

38
00:06:29,196 --> 00:06:31,247
since the club's put us out.

39
00:06:31,332 --> 00:06:34,283
- It may even be more fun!
- It's lovely!

40
00:06:34,368 --> 00:06:36,018
Like the country!

41
00:06:36,103 --> 00:06:40,356
Sorry that the court looks like
an old potato field.

42
00:06:40,441 --> 00:06:43,526
It needs a red clay top
and deeper backspaces.

43
00:06:43,611 --> 00:06:48,164
But to Papa, any land left uncultivated
seems a total waste.

44
00:06:48,249 --> 00:06:50,299
But next year maybe!

45
00:06:50,384 --> 00:06:53,636
Excuse me.
You haven't met Adriana Trentini.

46
00:06:53,721 --> 00:06:55,313
Carletto Sani.

47
00:06:56,557 --> 00:06:58,286
And Tonino Collevatti.

48
00:06:59,660 --> 00:07:02,845
- Want to change?
- Are we playing or not?

49
00:07:02,930 --> 00:07:06,559
Let the children play first,
then the champions.

50
00:07:09,070 --> 00:07:12,121
- You can change in the Hutte.
- What's that?

51
00:07:12,206 --> 00:07:14,231
The cabana.
Donç¨š you know German?

52
00:07:15,109 --> 00:07:17,475
Very bad. Learn it at once!

53
00:07:19,480 --> 00:07:21,380
Aren't you playing?

54
00:07:21,949 --> 00:07:24,076
Later. I don't feel like it now.

55
00:07:26,721 --> 00:07:28,838
Do you like him?

56
00:07:28,923 --> 00:07:31,607
- Do you?
- Oh, he's not my type.

57
00:07:31,692 --> 00:07:34,644
- Who is he?
- A great friend of Alberto.

58
00:07:34,729 --> 00:07:36,812
Milan, college, love affairs.

59
00:07:36,897 --> 00:07:38,648
He works in industry here.

60
00:07:38,733 --> 00:07:40,816
- How are you?
- Fine. And you?

61
00:07:40,901 --> 00:07:42,418
Fine.

62
00:07:42,503 --> 00:07:45,554
- Did you get your degree?
- In February. And you?

63
00:07:45,639 --> 00:07:47,664
- Me too.
- In Venice?

64
00:07:48,275 --> 00:07:51,694
- Yes, but will they let us graduate?
- I hope so.

65
00:07:51,779 --> 00:07:53,763
Where have you been hiding?

66
00:07:53,848 --> 00:07:56,799
I saw you
at the Venice Cultural Contests.

67
00:07:56,884 --> 00:07:58,901
I knew it was you.
You haven't changed.

68
00:07:58,986 --> 00:08:02,405
Why didn't you come over?
It would have been nice.

69
00:08:02,490 --> 00:08:04,206
I don't know.

70
00:08:04,291 --> 00:08:06,609
Somehow, I finally decided not to.

71
00:08:06,694 --> 00:08:08,778
What's your thesis on?

72
00:08:08,863 --> 00:08:10,846
English. Emily Dickinson.

73
00:08:10,931 --> 00:08:13,282
The 19th-century American poet.

74
00:08:13,367 --> 00:08:16,285
A fantastic woman.
An old maid like me.

75
00:08:16,370 --> 00:08:19,168
Here we are!
Jor!

76
00:08:20,408 --> 00:08:22,706
Good dog!

77
00:08:26,680 --> 00:08:29,298
Beautiful,
but maybe a bit silly?

78
00:08:29,383 --> 00:08:31,801
Perhaps.
What do you care?

79
00:08:31,886 --> 00:08:34,003
Oh, me...

80
00:08:34,088 --> 00:08:36,539
I've always liked women
of Gladys' type.

81
00:08:36,624 --> 00:08:39,508
Beautiful, stupid,
and sufficiently--

82
00:08:39,593 --> 00:08:41,493
Whorish.

83
00:08:42,029 --> 00:08:44,246
Do you like Ferrara?

84
00:08:44,331 --> 00:08:48,250
It's not nearly as dead
as you told me it was.

85
00:08:48,335 --> 00:08:51,420
It's lively.
Lots of interesting people.

86
00:08:51,505 --> 00:08:53,522
Especially among the proletariat...

87
00:08:53,607 --> 00:08:56,492
in the so-called working class.

88
00:08:56,577 --> 00:08:58,928
But the middle class
I don't care for.

89
00:08:59,013 --> 00:09:01,777
They're all of them
more or less Fascists.

90
00:09:02,483 --> 00:09:04,734
Except for you Jews...

91
00:09:04,819 --> 00:09:06,569
understandably...

92
00:09:06,654 --> 00:09:08,246
considering--

93
00:09:08,989 --> 00:09:11,807
But at least the workers
at my place...

94
00:09:11,892 --> 00:09:13,917
are almost all antifascist.

95
00:09:16,363 --> 00:09:18,247
This is nice...

96
00:09:18,332 --> 00:09:20,649
but to think
of being here forever--

97
00:09:20,734 --> 00:09:22,351
You never go out anymore?

98
00:09:22,436 --> 00:09:26,304
No, never.
Anyway, where would I go?

99
00:09:26,807 --> 00:09:31,227
If it were possible to pick the faces
one met on the street...

100
00:09:31,312 --> 00:09:33,678
I would go out.

101
00:09:34,381 --> 00:09:36,966
But whenever I did go out...

102
00:09:37,051 --> 00:09:40,369
I always felt
I was being spied on...

103
00:09:40,454 --> 00:09:42,004
envied.

104
00:09:42,089 --> 00:09:44,373
Whereas here
you pick the faces.

105
00:09:44,458 --> 00:09:46,642
Is that what you mean?

106
00:09:46,727 --> 00:09:48,718
Not exactly.

107
00:09:49,363 --> 00:09:51,380
There are never many of us here.

108
00:09:51,465 --> 00:09:54,525
I never feel attacked.

109
00:09:55,035 --> 00:09:58,994
I know what you think:
that I have no zest for life.

110
00:10:02,776 --> 00:10:04,767
But who can give me that?

111
00:10:05,146 --> 00:10:07,763
My seven old graybeards--
you know what they are?

112
00:10:07,848 --> 00:10:11,841
- Palms.
- Good! But what kind of palms?

113
00:10:12,319 --> 00:10:14,549
I don't know.

114
00:10:15,156 --> 00:10:18,374
Granny Josette got them
from the Rome Botanical Garden.

115
00:10:18,459 --> 00:10:20,518
Washingtonia fiilifera.

116
00:10:21,629 --> 00:10:25,147
Why are you laughing?
You're so ignorant!

117
00:10:25,232 --> 00:10:28,684
I bet you can't tell
an elm from an oak.

118
00:10:28,769 --> 00:10:30,753
Come on, what tree is that?

119
00:10:30,838 --> 00:10:32,931
To me all trees are alike.

120
00:10:33,908 --> 00:10:38,436
I, for one, detest anyone
who doesn't love trees!

121
00:10:38,612 --> 00:10:40,443
That plane tree, for example...

122
00:10:41,382 --> 00:10:45,000
may have been planted
by Lucrezia Borgia!

123
00:10:45,085 --> 00:10:49,545
Imagine!
It's nearly 500 years old.

124
00:10:49,790 --> 00:10:51,883
Let's go.

125
00:10:52,026 --> 00:10:53,742
Oh, a flat tire!

126
00:10:53,827 --> 00:10:56,412
When I was little,
I used to run off.

127
00:10:56,497 --> 00:10:59,381
Not Alberto.
He was always more obedient.

128
00:10:59,466 --> 00:11:03,085
One day,
when I'd stayed out too long...

129
00:11:03,170 --> 00:11:05,254
near the Wall of the Angels...

130
00:11:05,339 --> 00:11:08,858
riding on bike handlebars
with a gang of boys...

131
00:11:08,943 --> 00:11:13,195
when I got home,
I found my parents in such despair...

132
00:11:13,280 --> 00:11:15,464
that I decided to be good.

133
00:11:15,549 --> 00:11:19,001
- I never ran off again.
- I thought you only rode with me!

134
00:11:19,086 --> 00:11:22,171
I never invited anyone else
into our garden.

135
00:11:22,256 --> 00:11:23,639
Honestly?

136
00:11:23,724 --> 00:11:26,090
Shall I stop?

137
00:11:26,493 --> 00:11:29,121
Do you remember?

138
00:11:29,897 --> 00:11:31,614
Ten years ago.

139
00:11:31,699 --> 00:11:33,462
You were just a child, Giorgio.

140
00:11:37,137 --> 00:11:39,421
You really must be blind!

141
00:11:39,506 --> 00:11:41,290
What are you doing?

142
00:11:41,375 --> 00:11:44,426
I've been watching you
for ten minutes.

143
00:11:44,511 --> 00:11:46,829
If you were asleep
and I woke you...

144
00:11:46,914 --> 00:11:49,131
do excuse me.

145
00:11:49,216 --> 00:11:51,033
You have my sympathy.

146
00:11:51,118 --> 00:11:54,713
Sympathy? Why? What for?

147
00:11:57,791 --> 00:12:00,142
- What time is it?
- 3:00, I think.

148
00:12:00,227 --> 00:12:03,779
You must be hungry.
Flunked an exam, didnç¨š you?

149
00:12:03,864 --> 00:12:05,814
Did you pass all yours?

150
00:12:05,899 --> 00:12:09,552
I don't know. We private pupils
take orals after you do.

151
00:12:09,637 --> 00:12:11,053
I had mine today.

152
00:12:11,138 --> 00:12:14,657
Relax! It's not important,
repeating an exam!

153
00:12:14,742 --> 00:12:17,860
Yes, it is,
when it's the first time.

154
00:12:17,945 --> 00:12:20,140
But it's done,
and I'm over it now.

155
00:12:20,681 --> 00:12:24,133
You are? Then why didnç¨š you
go home for lunch?

156
00:12:24,218 --> 00:12:26,936
- How did you know?
- We just know.

157
00:12:27,021 --> 00:12:29,004
We have ways
of getting information.

158
00:12:29,089 --> 00:12:32,041
How can you perch there,
like at a window?

159
00:12:32,126 --> 00:12:35,118
On my trusty ladder.

160
00:12:37,765 --> 00:12:41,183
Come on over.
I'll show you what to do.

161
00:12:41,268 --> 00:12:42,985
But it looks too high.

162
00:12:43,070 --> 00:12:44,753
No, it's easy.

163
00:12:44,838 --> 00:12:47,739
Use the notches
and those nails I drove in.

164
00:12:48,409 --> 00:12:50,192
Where can I leave my bike?

165
00:12:50,277 --> 00:12:53,929
Signorina Micol, that's dangerous!
You get down!

166
00:12:54,014 --> 00:12:56,332
All right! Stop yelling!

167
00:12:56,417 --> 00:12:58,534
The professor said not to go out!

168
00:12:58,619 --> 00:13:01,247
It's dangerous, I say!

169
00:13:17,504 --> 00:13:21,941
Ten years had to pass
before you opened your garden again.

170
00:13:25,479 --> 00:13:28,380
- Alberto!
- Let him whistle!

171
00:13:29,550 --> 00:13:31,381
Wait for me!

172
00:13:35,622 --> 00:13:37,715
Collevatti, you're an ace!

173
00:13:41,495 --> 00:13:43,156
Well, that was nice today.

174
00:13:44,865 --> 00:13:48,460
Yes, but actually,
it was nicer when we were alone.

175
00:13:59,880 --> 00:14:01,370
Remember this?

176
00:14:14,762 --> 00:14:16,845
Are you cold?

177
00:14:16,930 --> 00:14:18,625
Yes, just a bit.

178
00:14:22,936 --> 00:14:26,989
Gina, please bring up
a hot water bottle.

179
00:14:27,074 --> 00:14:29,065
Right away.

180
00:14:30,144 --> 00:14:32,339
Off to bed!

181
00:14:33,347 --> 00:14:35,815
No, I don't feel like it.

182
00:14:45,959 --> 00:14:48,844
What will I be like when I'm old?

183
00:14:48,929 --> 00:14:51,193
Like Granny Josette?

184
00:14:52,399 --> 00:14:55,551
Well, if we live, we'll find out.

185
00:14:55,636 --> 00:15:00,096
Today's paper! Read all about
the meeting of the Supreme Council!

186
00:15:04,511 --> 00:15:07,463
You think weå€¤l move
into the B League?

187
00:15:07,548 --> 00:15:09,264
We can make it!

188
00:15:09,349 --> 00:15:13,581
Today's paper! Read all about
the meeting of the Supreme Council!

189
00:16:02,069 --> 00:16:05,320
You spent yesterday afternoon
at the Finzi-Continis?

190
00:16:05,405 --> 00:16:06,688
Yes.

191
00:16:06,773 --> 00:16:09,571
And how were they?
Pleasant?

192
00:16:10,277 --> 00:16:11,744
Very pleasant.

193
00:16:12,713 --> 00:16:15,030
I'm sure they were!

194
00:16:15,115 --> 00:16:18,607
Yes, because they're glad
about what's happening.

195
00:16:19,152 --> 00:16:21,837
- It's quite clear.
- What is?

196
00:16:21,922 --> 00:16:25,707
That they basically welcome
the anti-Semitic laws.

197
00:16:25,792 --> 00:16:28,761
They're eager to see them passed.

198
00:16:29,196 --> 00:16:31,480
Invitations, broad smiles,
low bows...

199
00:16:31,565 --> 00:16:35,023
and the garden finally opened
to everyone!

200
00:16:36,169 --> 00:16:40,322
Converted into a ghetto
under their noble patronage!

201
00:16:40,407 --> 00:16:42,758
In ghettos there are only Jews.

202
00:16:42,843 --> 00:16:46,061
At the Finzi-Continis,
except for Lattes and me...

203
00:16:46,146 --> 00:16:48,464
they're all Aryans.

204
00:16:48,549 --> 00:16:49,865
Take Adriana Trentini!

205
00:16:49,950 --> 00:16:53,302
Tricks, vile tricks,
just to get hold of you!

206
00:16:53,387 --> 00:16:55,804
Next comes your pet mania!

207
00:16:55,889 --> 00:16:57,550
Meaning?

208
00:16:58,625 --> 00:17:02,010
That our Mussolini
is better than Hitler...

209
00:17:02,095 --> 00:17:04,529
our fascism better than Nazism!

210
00:17:05,198 --> 00:17:07,291
Well, it's true!

211
00:17:08,635 --> 00:17:10,865
Did you see today's paper?

212
00:17:11,204 --> 00:17:13,195
Then read it!

213
00:17:38,632 --> 00:17:41,328
What?
I don't have my glasses.

214
00:17:41,735 --> 00:17:45,721
It says that Jews
may no longer marry non-Jews...

215
00:17:45,806 --> 00:17:49,057
and are barred from state schools.

216
00:17:49,142 --> 00:17:51,593
What about Giorgio's degree?

217
00:17:51,678 --> 00:17:54,863
- Except--
- Except what?

218
00:17:54,948 --> 00:17:57,833
Persons of high patriotic
and Fascist merit.

219
00:17:57,918 --> 00:18:01,479
- You're a party member.
- Yes, but that's not enough.

220
00:18:03,924 --> 00:18:07,189
Don't laugh, stupid!
You'll have to quit school.

221
00:18:10,897 --> 00:18:12,762
Come on!

222
00:18:20,107 --> 00:18:21,904
You may clear.

223
00:18:23,310 --> 00:18:26,261
I forgot to add:
no more domestiques...

224
00:18:26,346 --> 00:18:27,506
of the racearyenne.

225
00:18:28,081 --> 00:18:29,998
No more domestiques?

226
00:18:30,083 --> 00:18:32,734
- Apparently.
- How will we manage?

227
00:18:32,819 --> 00:18:35,219
We'll manage.
We'll manage somehow.

228
00:18:39,660 --> 00:18:42,128
- May I?
- Yes, Father.

229
00:19:03,183 --> 00:19:05,117
What is that?

230
00:19:08,321 --> 00:19:10,806
"" 19th-Century Europe""
Is it interesting?

231
00:19:10,891 --> 00:19:12,882
- Quite.
- Let me read it after you.

232
00:19:21,468 --> 00:19:25,654
Look, I understand how you feel,
but you have to admit...

233
00:19:25,739 --> 00:19:27,522
we're not so badly off here.

234
00:19:27,607 --> 00:19:30,092
Granted: no more mixed marriages.

235
00:19:30,177 --> 00:19:32,194
That's actually not too--

236
00:19:32,279 --> 00:19:34,429
No phone listings,
no public schools...

237
00:19:34,514 --> 00:19:37,232
and that, I must agree, is serious.

238
00:19:37,317 --> 00:19:40,218
So is being barred
from the armed forces.

239
00:19:40,787 --> 00:19:42,871
No obituaries in the newspapers...

240
00:19:42,956 --> 00:19:46,050
and now, no servants.

241
00:19:46,626 --> 00:19:48,844
But apart from that...

242
00:19:48,929 --> 00:19:52,648
you'll admit we can still live,
move about, own property.

243
00:19:52,733 --> 00:19:56,051
- In effect, be a citizen.
- Third-class.

244
00:19:56,136 --> 00:19:59,554
Third-class, if you will,
but still a citizen who can...

245
00:19:59,639 --> 00:20:01,766
enjoy his basic rights.

246
00:20:03,777 --> 00:20:05,870
Such as?

247
00:20:07,781 --> 00:20:11,842
There have always been
few enough rights for anyone.

248
00:20:12,786 --> 00:20:17,621
We weren't the first
to be persecuted. That is true.

249
00:20:18,458 --> 00:20:22,189
But we all kept quiet
as long as we weren't hit.

250
00:20:25,398 --> 00:20:27,195
Nevertheless...

251
00:20:27,834 --> 00:20:31,653
I don't think you should
keep yourself so isolated...

252
00:20:31,738 --> 00:20:35,223
or refuse to come to the phone.

253
00:20:35,308 --> 00:20:38,368
It's very bad for you
to segregate yourself.

254
00:20:40,981 --> 00:20:43,498
For your poor brother
and sister too...

255
00:20:43,583 --> 00:20:46,677
because, naturally,
they imitate you.

256
00:20:47,053 --> 00:20:51,873
Like giving up the Tennis Club.
They're not expelling you.

257
00:20:51,958 --> 00:20:55,277
Nor me from
the Chamber of Commerce.

258
00:20:55,362 --> 00:20:59,114
Donç¨š you see, good God,
that youæ± e playing into the hands...

259
00:20:59,199 --> 00:21:02,430
of the very people
who want us to stop being...

260
00:21:02,736 --> 00:21:04,294
Italians!

261
00:21:06,640 --> 00:21:09,666
I've already been expelled
from the Tennis Club.

262
00:21:25,926 --> 00:21:27,976
Who are those two people?

263
00:21:28,061 --> 00:21:30,052
My mother and father.

264
00:21:30,497 --> 00:21:33,915
Don't stop.
Please don't let us disturb you.

265
00:21:34,000 --> 00:21:36,051
Do go on playing.

266
00:21:36,136 --> 00:21:38,400
Good afternoon!

267
00:21:42,542 --> 00:21:44,693
Still at it?
I haven't played yet!

268
00:21:44,778 --> 00:21:47,645
I'll just watch this time.

269
00:22:02,896 --> 00:22:06,093
I feel you're not really
interested in men.

270
00:22:07,234 --> 00:22:10,795
That's true.
In your case, at any rate.

271
00:22:11,838 --> 00:22:14,602
What donç¨š you like about me?

272
00:22:15,075 --> 00:22:18,238
My friendship with your brother?

273
00:22:19,713 --> 00:22:21,930
May I also speak quite frankly?

274
00:22:22,015 --> 00:22:25,400
- Please do. Frankness--
- Is your fetish, we know.

275
00:22:25,485 --> 00:22:27,769
The main thing is
you're too frank...

276
00:22:27,854 --> 00:22:30,539
and therefore, inevitably, well--

277
00:22:30,624 --> 00:22:33,508
- Ill-bred.
- Precisely.

278
00:22:33,593 --> 00:22:35,288
Second--

279
00:22:43,904 --> 00:22:46,805
You're too much
the industrious Lombard...

280
00:22:47,107 --> 00:22:48,757
too much a Communist...

281
00:22:48,842 --> 00:22:50,659
and, finally...

282
00:22:50,744 --> 00:22:52,143
too hairy.

283
00:22:53,747 --> 00:22:55,977
Bravo, Desiree!

284
00:22:58,051 --> 00:23:00,402
You played for three hours.
Who won?

285
00:23:00,487 --> 00:23:04,239
- Desiree.
- I've got something to show you.

286
00:23:04,324 --> 00:23:05,791
Later, when we're alone.

287
00:23:06,626 --> 00:23:09,911
- What a crowd!
- My uncles and my grandmother.

288
00:23:09,996 --> 00:23:13,815
Micol, your uncles are here.

289
00:23:13,900 --> 00:23:17,619
- This is a friend of Alberto's.
- Delighted.

290
00:23:17,704 --> 00:23:20,822
Alberto has often spoken to us
about you.

291
00:23:20,907 --> 00:23:24,274
Please do come visit us.

292
00:23:29,349 --> 00:23:31,340
Have you perspired much?

293
00:23:31,885 --> 00:23:33,602
Some.

294
00:23:33,687 --> 00:23:36,121
You should be careful.

295
00:23:37,691 --> 00:23:40,242
Was it hot in Bologna, Uncle?

296
00:23:40,327 --> 00:23:42,488
Oh, yes!

297
00:23:45,932 --> 00:23:48,901
Eighty-six degrees in the shade.

298
00:23:50,303 --> 00:23:53,272
Here you can breathe.

299
00:23:55,442 --> 00:23:58,411
You were on a consultation?

300
00:24:06,853 --> 00:24:08,684
Yes, I was.

301
00:24:09,322 --> 00:24:12,849
How did Uncle Federico
happen to go along with you?

302
00:24:14,995 --> 00:24:18,947
Since being forced out
of his railroad post...

303
00:24:19,032 --> 00:24:22,584
he has nothing to do,
the lucky fellow.

304
00:24:22,669 --> 00:24:25,331
And he enjoys driving.

305
00:24:26,639 --> 00:24:29,090
- How are you?
- Fine.

306
00:24:29,175 --> 00:24:32,594
Just a little tired.

307
00:24:32,679 --> 00:24:34,829
Are you sleeping?

308
00:24:34,914 --> 00:24:36,973
Not well.

309
00:24:39,719 --> 00:24:42,313
It's not going to rain!

310
00:24:55,769 --> 00:24:58,329
Are you coming with me?

311
00:25:00,940 --> 00:25:02,965
Let's go.

312
00:25:12,685 --> 00:25:14,380
That crazy Micol!

313
00:25:22,095 --> 00:25:23,926
See there?

314
00:25:25,231 --> 00:25:28,450
That's where we had
our gym lessons.

315
00:25:28,535 --> 00:25:30,662
And the carriage
I rode to school in.

316
00:25:31,404 --> 00:25:33,463
You recognize it?

317
00:25:34,274 --> 00:25:36,691
Good as ever,
but no flowers inside.

318
00:25:36,776 --> 00:25:39,661
Perrotti still puts them in.

319
00:25:39,746 --> 00:25:42,230
He only drives Granny
around the garden in it.

320
00:25:42,315 --> 00:25:45,033
Perrotti works here
despite the new laws?

321
00:25:45,118 --> 00:25:48,053
Isn't it risky if they find out?

322
00:25:49,422 --> 00:25:51,806
- No, it's a secret.
- Sorry.

323
00:25:51,891 --> 00:25:54,743
Papa's a big donor
to government charities.

324
00:25:54,828 --> 00:25:56,796
Where will it end?

325
00:25:59,532 --> 00:26:01,022
Get in.

326
00:26:13,379 --> 00:26:17,332
It seems only yesterday
that you came to the synagogue in it.

327
00:26:17,417 --> 00:26:19,367
How long ago that was!

328
00:26:19,452 --> 00:26:24,082
The few times we went,
I'd look for you.

329
00:26:58,291 --> 00:27:00,725
Giorgio, don't you like it
better now?

330
00:27:01,461 --> 00:27:02,577
Why?

331
00:27:02,662 --> 00:27:05,880
Why? Because we can stay here
by ourselves...

332
00:27:05,965 --> 00:27:09,264
with no one to scold us,
for one thing!

333
00:27:10,170 --> 00:27:13,537
Children are always prisoners
of grown-ups.

334
00:27:13,806 --> 00:27:15,457
I mean...

335
00:27:15,542 --> 00:27:18,636
I like to feel I'm a woman.

336
00:27:20,480 --> 00:27:23,798
And you? Would you rather
still be a child?

337
00:27:23,883 --> 00:27:25,066
No, but--

338
00:27:25,151 --> 00:27:27,415
So many ""buts""!

339
00:27:57,116 --> 00:27:59,200
- Micol, wait!
- Too late!

340
00:27:59,285 --> 00:28:01,870
- It's raining!
- Oh, just a few drops!

341
00:28:01,955 --> 00:28:03,972
You know the way to the gate?

342
00:28:04,057 --> 00:28:06,685
Of course you do.
You came that way.

343
00:28:09,963 --> 00:28:11,954
Phone us sometime.

344
00:28:15,134 --> 00:28:16,818
Defend your queen!

345
00:28:16,903 --> 00:28:19,701
It's no use.
You're too good for me!

346
00:28:22,675 --> 00:28:25,160
- What's so funny?
- I was thinking--

347
00:28:25,245 --> 00:28:27,061
About what?

348
00:28:27,146 --> 00:28:28,730
I was thinking...

349
00:28:28,815 --> 00:28:31,299
of Gladys in Milan...

350
00:28:31,384 --> 00:28:33,134
and asking myself--

351
00:28:33,219 --> 00:28:34,469
What?

352
00:28:34,554 --> 00:28:37,138
Whether you ever slept
with her or not.

353
00:28:37,223 --> 00:28:40,124
It's been three years now.

354
00:28:40,560 --> 00:28:43,077
I didn't even find her
at all attractive.

355
00:28:43,162 --> 00:28:46,314
Then what made you act mysterious,
even jealous...

356
00:28:46,399 --> 00:28:48,560
over some ballet dancer?

357
00:28:50,870 --> 00:28:52,861
Well--

358
00:28:54,574 --> 00:28:57,805
And I was so full of scruples!

359
00:28:58,745 --> 00:29:01,796
Maritain says you Jews
are never boring.

360
00:29:01,881 --> 00:29:06,215
It's quite true.
You're so very complicated.

361
00:29:06,986 --> 00:29:08,436
Come now.

362
00:29:08,521 --> 00:29:10,512
Did you ever go to a brothel?

363
00:29:13,793 --> 00:29:16,353
- Did you?
- Me? But of course!

364
00:29:17,697 --> 00:29:19,714
How pretty and chic we are!

365
00:29:19,799 --> 00:29:21,382
Listen...

366
00:29:21,467 --> 00:29:25,019
our uncles are dining
and sleeping here.

367
00:29:25,104 --> 00:29:26,765
He's dining here too.

368
00:29:27,440 --> 00:29:30,671
- And sleeping?
- No, not sleeping.

369
00:29:52,598 --> 00:29:55,795
I'll phone you.
Tomorrow morning.

370
00:29:57,637 --> 00:29:59,434
Good night.

371
00:30:02,041 --> 00:30:04,305
- Who was it?
- Giorgio.

372
00:30:07,480 --> 00:30:11,833
I've decided not to stay.
We'll play another time.

373
00:30:11,918 --> 00:30:13,735
- Why?
- Good night.

374
00:30:13,820 --> 00:30:16,871
Do stay.
To please Alberto.

375
00:30:16,956 --> 00:30:19,440
I might even apologize then.

376
00:30:19,525 --> 00:30:22,653
Apologize for what?
Good night.

377
00:30:23,796 --> 00:30:26,381
- Will you phone me?
- Yes, I will.

378
00:30:26,466 --> 00:30:28,798
You really will phone?

379
00:30:35,174 --> 00:30:38,075
She's in the kitchen
ironing your coat.

380
00:30:41,047 --> 00:30:44,483
- Hurry!
- Dear, I only have two hands.

381
00:30:45,551 --> 00:30:47,542
Someone at the door!

382
00:30:51,824 --> 00:30:54,554
- Who is it?
- Me, Maria.

383
00:30:55,561 --> 00:30:58,179
- Did anyone see you?
- Carlino.

384
00:30:58,264 --> 00:31:02,291
But he minds his own business.
He won't talk.

385
00:31:02,535 --> 00:31:05,620
I told her to come earlier,
but she lives so far away.

386
00:31:05,705 --> 00:31:09,123
- You know it's unwise.
- She's only here a few hours.

387
00:31:09,208 --> 00:31:11,073
But she's here.

388
00:31:12,645 --> 00:31:16,706
Anyway, let's not tell your father.
He'd be worried.

389
00:32:09,068 --> 00:32:12,053
- Hello. May I come in?
- Of course.

390
00:32:12,138 --> 00:32:14,989
- You want to see?
- Signor Alberto.

391
00:32:15,074 --> 00:32:16,624
Not likely today.

392
00:32:16,709 --> 00:32:20,406
He's in bed with a fever.
He got drenched in the rain.

393
00:32:21,080 --> 00:32:24,811
- And the young lady?
- She's not here. She's gone.

394
00:32:25,751 --> 00:32:27,468
Gone?

395
00:32:27,553 --> 00:32:30,805
- Where?
- To Venice, with her uncles.

396
00:32:30,890 --> 00:32:33,791
They all went off
less than an hour ago.

397
00:32:34,193 --> 00:32:37,253
She left no message for me?

398
00:32:53,145 --> 00:32:55,613
The back table is free.

399
00:33:12,164 --> 00:33:15,516
Excuse me, but the director
told me that...

400
00:33:15,601 --> 00:33:18,085
you can't stay here.

401
00:33:18,170 --> 00:33:20,555
You mean...

402
00:33:20,640 --> 00:33:21,823
I have to move?

403
00:33:21,908 --> 00:33:24,604
Not move.
Just get out of here.

404
00:33:26,646 --> 00:33:29,240
- Why?
- Don't ask me!

405
00:33:36,122 --> 00:33:38,606
I want to talk with the director.

406
00:33:38,691 --> 00:33:41,576
- I can't!
- Go on!

407
00:33:41,661 --> 00:33:43,993
Tell him I'm on my way
to see him.

408
00:33:54,607 --> 00:33:57,425
I'm sorry, dear boy.
I'm so terribly sorry.

409
00:33:57,510 --> 00:33:59,460
But it's not up to me.

410
00:33:59,545 --> 00:34:01,829
Instructions are instructions.

411
00:34:01,914 --> 00:34:04,610
- If I could--
- If you could--

412
00:34:05,151 --> 00:34:08,903
Personally, I'd be delighted
for a talented young man like you--

413
00:34:08,988 --> 00:34:11,005
As your father's old friend--

414
00:34:11,090 --> 00:34:13,474
With your brilliant
literary future--

415
00:34:13,559 --> 00:34:17,393
By the way, how is the poetry?
Still writing?

416
00:34:21,133 --> 00:34:23,101
Listen.

417
00:34:28,608 --> 00:34:30,358
Be patient. I have--

418
00:34:30,443 --> 00:34:33,207
Yes, I know.
You have a family.

419
00:34:33,779 --> 00:34:36,373
All Italy has a family.

420
00:35:17,356 --> 00:35:18,973
He's sorry.
He has a family.

421
00:35:19,058 --> 00:35:23,154
I understand. Poor fellow.
I know it wasn't up to him.

422
00:35:23,562 --> 00:35:26,656
- How is Alberto?
- So-so.

423
00:35:33,739 --> 00:35:37,792
- He's come here to study.
- Splendid, splendid.

424
00:35:37,877 --> 00:35:40,141
- What's he doing here?
- Studying.

425
00:35:40,513 --> 00:35:42,913
Good, good.

426
00:35:46,118 --> 00:35:49,281
- What's he doing here?
- Studying, Mama.

427
00:35:58,230 --> 00:36:01,682
There you are:
your table, your books.

428
00:36:01,767 --> 00:36:03,718
What's your thesis on?

429
00:36:03,803 --> 00:36:07,054
It will deal with the poetry
of Enrico Panzacchi.

430
00:36:07,139 --> 00:36:09,357
Fine choice. Very interesting.

431
00:36:09,442 --> 00:36:11,876
One of Carducci's school.

432
00:36:12,945 --> 00:36:17,164
I think youå€¤l find we have
everything the library has...

433
00:36:17,249 --> 00:36:19,376
though we're more selective.

434
00:36:20,252 --> 00:36:22,269
The major works are all here.

435
00:36:22,354 --> 00:36:23,604
Thank you.

436
00:36:23,689 --> 00:36:26,974
Is it true you have
some unpublished works by Carducci?

437
00:36:27,059 --> 00:36:29,477
I'll show them to you one day.

438
00:36:29,562 --> 00:36:31,212
I'm in there.

439
00:36:31,297 --> 00:36:35,461
If you need anything--
coffee, lemonade...

440
00:36:36,268 --> 00:36:38,532
a bit of advice--
just call me.

441
00:36:50,449 --> 00:36:52,667
- They're lucky!
- Who?

442
00:36:52,752 --> 00:36:54,235
The private pupils.

443
00:36:54,320 --> 00:36:57,414
They're easy to spot.
They're different.

444
00:37:33,192 --> 00:37:36,010
What's happening in Ferrara?

445
00:37:36,095 --> 00:37:38,393
Whom do you see?

446
00:37:39,398 --> 00:37:43,095
When am I coming back?
Tomorrow, if I could.

447
00:37:43,335 --> 00:37:45,769
I must finish my thesis first.

448
00:37:46,038 --> 00:37:49,804
Surely by Passover.
When is it this year?

449
00:37:50,342 --> 00:37:53,004
No, I can't any sooner.

450
00:37:53,345 --> 00:37:56,075
It's like a century
since I saw you.

451
00:38:00,719 --> 00:38:01,969
What's wrong?

452
00:38:02,054 --> 00:38:06,115
Why, nothing, Micol.
I'm fine, I assure you.

453
00:38:06,358 --> 00:38:09,088
I long to have you back here.

454
00:38:13,065 --> 00:38:16,984
That's true, but there's no reason
for you to worry.

455
00:38:17,069 --> 00:38:19,867
I've had the X rays.

456
00:38:20,372 --> 00:38:22,533
No, nothing new.

457
00:38:24,310 --> 00:38:27,541
I said there's nothing new.

458
00:38:29,381 --> 00:38:32,043
Shall I phone tomorrow?

459
00:38:32,451 --> 00:38:34,568
If you like.

460
00:38:34,653 --> 00:38:38,005
All right. I promise.

461
00:38:38,090 --> 00:38:41,856
- Where are all these troops going?
- To their regiments. Then who knows?

462
00:38:47,266 --> 00:38:49,350
Want some newspapers?

463
00:38:49,435 --> 00:38:52,802
I'll wait and read
the French ones tomorrow.

464
00:39:06,085 --> 00:39:08,849
I think there's a seat over here.

465
00:39:10,890 --> 00:39:13,791
No, this way!

466
00:39:13,926 --> 00:39:15,876
Ernesto!

467
00:39:15,961 --> 00:39:19,513
Try to get some sleep tonight,
wonç¨š you, please?

468
00:39:19,598 --> 00:39:23,466
No, I want to be awake
crossing the French border.

469
00:39:24,637 --> 00:39:28,322
Try to economize.
We can't send much money abroad.

470
00:39:28,407 --> 00:39:31,433
So put it away safely
and be very careful.

471
00:39:42,421 --> 00:39:45,413
I'm just going off to school,
not to war!

472
00:39:58,170 --> 00:40:01,401
- Got everything?
- Yes, everything.

473
00:40:11,317 --> 00:40:13,400
Who can tell, who knows well

474
00:40:13,485 --> 00:40:15,703
What is the meaning of One?

475
00:40:15,788 --> 00:40:19,087
One God who dwells in heaven

476
00:40:19,525 --> 00:40:21,442
Who can tell, who knows well

477
00:40:21,527 --> 00:40:23,844
Whatç—´ the meaning of Two?

478
00:40:23,929 --> 00:40:25,813
Two, the tablets of Moses

479
00:40:25,898 --> 00:40:27,915
One was, One is

480
00:40:28,000 --> 00:40:30,050
One forever One shall be

481
00:40:30,135 --> 00:40:32,899
One God who dwells in heaven

482
00:40:33,572 --> 00:40:35,623
Who can tell, who knows well

483
00:40:35,708 --> 00:40:37,725
Whatç—´ the meaning of Three?

484
00:40:37,810 --> 00:40:40,027
Our own patriarchs are Three

485
00:40:40,112 --> 00:40:42,263
Abraham, Isaac and Jacob

486
00:40:42,348 --> 00:40:44,131
Two, the tablets of Moses

487
00:40:44,216 --> 00:40:46,267
One was, One is

488
00:40:46,352 --> 00:40:48,602
One forever One shall be

489
00:40:48,687 --> 00:40:52,145
One God who dwells in heaven

490
00:40:52,758 --> 00:40:54,775
Who can tell, who knows well

491
00:40:54,860 --> 00:40:57,124
Whatç—´ the meaning of Four?

492
00:41:02,334 --> 00:41:04,029
Hello.

493
00:41:24,890 --> 00:41:26,653
Who is it?

494
00:41:37,569 --> 00:41:40,094
- Who was it?
- No one.

495
00:41:42,241 --> 00:41:44,491
That happens to me too,
at night.

496
00:41:44,576 --> 00:41:48,095
Every night. I go to pick up the phone
and nobody answers.

497
00:41:48,180 --> 00:41:50,774
What do they want?
Who are they?

498
00:42:13,172 --> 00:42:15,956
Did you just ring up
and not answer?

499
00:42:16,041 --> 00:42:19,306
Because someone just did
and wouldn't talk.

500
00:42:19,611 --> 00:42:22,478
What? A surprise?

501
00:42:22,815 --> 00:42:25,132
What kind of surprise?

502
00:42:25,217 --> 00:42:28,369
Look, canç¨š you at least
give me a hint?

503
00:42:28,454 --> 00:42:31,150
Come on! How mysterious!

504
00:42:31,290 --> 00:42:32,951
Fine, I'll be right over.

505
00:42:33,792 --> 00:42:37,193
One God who dwells in heaven

506
00:43:02,521 --> 00:43:05,873
- I'm so glad to see you again!
- When did you come?

507
00:43:05,958 --> 00:43:08,552
This afternoon, with my uncles.

508
00:43:24,309 --> 00:43:27,176
- I'm sorry.
- Why should you be?

509
00:43:27,613 --> 00:43:30,980
I shouldn't have run out here.
It's my fault.

510
00:43:31,917 --> 00:43:33,867
What lovely snow!

511
00:43:33,952 --> 00:43:36,136
Venice didn't get any at all.

512
00:43:36,221 --> 00:43:38,689
If I had heard about it--

513
00:43:40,959 --> 00:43:44,861
- What's this?
- I'm engaged. Didnç¨š you know?

514
00:43:45,330 --> 00:43:47,781
I'm not!
Canç¨š you tell I'm joking?

515
00:43:47,866 --> 00:43:50,596
It's a Passover gift from Alberto.

516
00:43:52,204 --> 00:43:55,173
Come, they'll be worrying about us.

517
00:44:10,722 --> 00:44:12,383
Wait.

518
00:44:17,062 --> 00:44:19,179
- Nothing.
- Did you like the surprise?

519
00:44:19,264 --> 00:44:20,697
Did you like it?

520
00:44:26,838 --> 00:44:30,023
He was nice to come right over.
Maybe he guessed.

521
00:44:30,108 --> 00:44:32,126
I was curious, I must say.

522
00:44:32,211 --> 00:44:33,961
There's another surprise.

523
00:44:34,046 --> 00:44:35,395
That one I can guess.

524
00:44:35,480 --> 00:44:37,531
You got your degree.
Good for you!

525
00:44:37,616 --> 00:44:41,068
No cause for praise.
I made it, but without honors.

526
00:44:41,153 --> 00:44:45,487
The German professor,
a brute of a Nazi, had it in for me.

527
00:44:46,225 --> 00:44:49,820
Why, he even conducted his exams
in Nazi uniform!

528
00:44:50,662 --> 00:44:52,579
We have guests.

529
00:44:52,664 --> 00:44:54,928
Happy Passover!

530
00:44:57,769 --> 00:45:00,020
Sit down here by me.

531
00:45:00,105 --> 00:45:03,957
Giorgio, at last!
Why donç¨š you come more often?

532
00:45:04,042 --> 00:45:05,792
Alberto is so alone.

533
00:45:05,877 --> 00:45:08,141
I'm glad you're here this Passover.

534
00:45:10,415 --> 00:45:13,934
Sir, I was so pleased
to get Alberto's invitation.

535
00:45:14,019 --> 00:45:16,803
I didn't even know
Micol had come back.

536
00:45:16,888 --> 00:45:19,706
Fortunately our Micol
is home again.

537
00:45:19,791 --> 00:45:21,475
It's so sad without her.

538
00:45:21,560 --> 00:45:24,996
Behave, boys!
I can't breathe that way!

539
00:45:25,497 --> 00:45:27,814
Alberto's told us
so much about you.

540
00:45:27,899 --> 00:45:29,550
They're childhood friends.

541
00:45:29,635 --> 00:45:34,087
How's the thesis going?
You haven't used our library lately.

542
00:45:34,172 --> 00:45:37,524
After Passover
I'll be there again.

543
00:45:37,609 --> 00:45:40,227
Will your thesis be ready by June?

544
00:45:40,312 --> 00:45:42,062
I wonder.

545
00:45:42,147 --> 00:45:44,498
You should get it done...

546
00:45:44,583 --> 00:45:47,552
before they issue a decree
that now literature also...

547
00:45:48,420 --> 00:45:50,888
is Aryan.

548
00:45:53,425 --> 00:45:56,043
Such a lovely glass.
What's it for?

549
00:45:56,128 --> 00:45:58,858
My daughter brought it from Venice.

550
00:45:59,031 --> 00:46:02,783
It serves, she claims...

551
00:46:02,868 --> 00:46:04,952
to predict the future-- a joke!

552
00:46:05,037 --> 00:46:07,187
What has it said?

553
00:46:07,272 --> 00:46:09,022
All sorts of things.

554
00:46:09,107 --> 00:46:13,066
First we asked if Iå£‡ get my degree,
and it said no.

555
00:46:13,979 --> 00:46:16,063
Second...

556
00:46:16,148 --> 00:46:18,082
if Micol will marry.

557
00:46:19,518 --> 00:46:22,487
To this the answer wasnç¨š clear.

558
00:46:22,888 --> 00:46:25,880
Third, it said war is coming.

559
00:46:26,458 --> 00:46:28,375
A long war...

560
00:46:28,460 --> 00:46:31,545
painful for everyone,
not just for us...

561
00:46:31,630 --> 00:46:33,791
Negroes.

562
00:46:34,700 --> 00:46:37,417
But finally...

563
00:46:37,502 --> 00:46:39,553
ending in total victory...

564
00:46:39,638 --> 00:46:42,198
for the forces of good.

565
00:46:43,575 --> 00:46:45,406
Yes?

566
00:46:45,644 --> 00:46:47,635
It's the young man.

567
00:46:57,322 --> 00:46:59,620
Come on in.

568
00:47:00,392 --> 00:47:02,409
Don't be afraid I have the flu.

569
00:47:02,494 --> 00:47:04,689
Itç—´ just a cold.

570
00:47:05,931 --> 00:47:09,264
Sit down here.
We must talk.

571
00:47:13,505 --> 00:47:15,455
What are you reading?

572
00:47:15,540 --> 00:47:18,168
Cocteau. Very chic!

573
00:47:18,877 --> 00:47:22,496
But nothing like those great books
of our childhood...

574
00:47:22,581 --> 00:47:24,674
whenever we came down
with the flu!

575
00:47:25,584 --> 00:47:28,802
The Three Musketeers,
Twenty Years Later...

576
00:47:28,887 --> 00:47:30,537
Warand Peace.

577
00:47:30,622 --> 00:47:32,406
Those were real novels!

578
00:47:32,491 --> 00:47:35,483
Even when it comes to ""chic,""
they were better.

579
00:47:36,161 --> 00:47:39,927
This room is so different
from what I imagined.

580
00:47:46,338 --> 00:47:48,431
How are you?

581
00:47:48,974 --> 00:47:50,490
So-so.

582
00:47:50,575 --> 00:47:52,668
Listen, Giorgio...

583
00:47:55,380 --> 00:47:57,397
I'm sorry to hurt you.

584
00:47:57,482 --> 00:47:59,366
Terribly sorry.

585
00:47:59,451 --> 00:48:01,535
On the other hand...

586
00:48:01,620 --> 00:48:05,613
let's try not to ruin
our beautiful childhood memories.

587
00:48:06,625 --> 00:48:09,822
Look, I've done my very best.

588
00:48:09,928 --> 00:48:14,247
As soon as I noticed the bad turn
our relationship was taking...

589
00:48:14,332 --> 00:48:16,583
the growth of something false...

590
00:48:16,668 --> 00:48:20,087
of something wrong
and very dangerous--

591
00:48:20,172 --> 00:48:23,505
you have to admit it--
I went away.

592
00:48:25,510 --> 00:48:28,479
If I stayed in Venice so long...

593
00:48:29,381 --> 00:48:31,198
it was on your account.

594
00:48:31,283 --> 00:48:33,444
You must face it.

595
00:48:34,419 --> 00:48:36,319
It's not possible!

596
00:48:38,356 --> 00:48:40,187
But why?

597
00:48:40,659 --> 00:48:43,253
Why isn't it possible?

598
00:48:48,467 --> 00:48:50,298
Stop it!

599
00:48:51,570 --> 00:48:53,800
Please, don't!

600
00:48:54,372 --> 00:48:57,364
Stop it!
Someone may come in!

601
00:48:58,109 --> 00:49:00,077
Behave yourself!.

602
00:49:10,555 --> 00:49:14,321
Get up, please. I can't breathe.

603
00:49:52,998 --> 00:49:55,215
What's the point?

604
00:49:55,300 --> 00:49:57,651
It's utterly useless.

605
00:49:57,736 --> 00:50:00,728
Useless? Why is it useless?

606
00:50:06,077 --> 00:50:09,496
Why donç¨š you go in there?
You're all flushed.

607
00:50:09,581 --> 00:50:11,242
Wash your face.

608
00:50:17,188 --> 00:50:18,872
Who is it?

609
00:50:18,957 --> 00:50:20,948
It's Jor. Let him in.

610
00:50:34,039 --> 00:50:37,133
Lie down.
There, that's a good dog!

611
00:50:59,965 --> 00:51:01,796
Who was that?

612
00:51:03,802 --> 00:51:05,736
And now, please leave.

613
00:51:07,806 --> 00:51:12,072
- Shall I phone tomorrow?
- No, we mustn't phone each other.

614
00:51:12,510 --> 00:51:14,239
And best not to come back.

615
00:51:16,815 --> 00:51:17,907
Never?

616
00:51:18,350 --> 00:51:19,766
Please.

617
00:51:19,851 --> 00:51:23,309
It's much better for both of us,
believe me.

618
00:51:26,992 --> 00:51:28,960
Good-bye?

619
00:51:30,662 --> 00:51:32,152
Good-bye.

620
00:51:50,749 --> 00:51:53,149
- Still awake?
- Yes, Father.

621
00:51:57,288 --> 00:51:59,539
I'm up late tonight also.

622
00:51:59,624 --> 00:52:02,058
I felt like taking a walk.

623
00:52:02,327 --> 00:52:04,625
Too many people during the day.

624
00:52:06,231 --> 00:52:08,381
Why are you still awake?

625
00:52:08,466 --> 00:52:11,451
- Anything wrong?
- No, nothing.

626
00:52:11,536 --> 00:52:13,868
You saw Ernesto's letter?

627
00:52:15,573 --> 00:52:19,873
How would you like to visit him
in Grenoble for a few days?

628
00:52:21,279 --> 00:52:25,365
We must get some money to him
before it's too late.

629
00:52:25,450 --> 00:52:27,179
Too late for what?

630
00:52:27,786 --> 00:52:30,804
Nothing. If a thing needs doing,
get it done.

631
00:52:30,889 --> 00:52:32,639
I could leave tomorrow.

632
00:52:32,724 --> 00:52:36,142
No, it takes a few days
to get a French visa.

633
00:52:36,227 --> 00:52:38,923
Besides, to raise the money...

634
00:52:39,597 --> 00:52:42,382
I have to sell our securities.

635
00:52:42,467 --> 00:52:46,553
We must be cautious.
They're quick to accuse us.

636
00:52:46,638 --> 00:52:50,624
- And they have lots of imagination.
- The French visa is no problem.

637
00:52:50,709 --> 00:52:52,959
But will they let me out?

638
00:52:53,044 --> 00:52:54,705
Why not?

639
00:52:55,013 --> 00:52:57,345
We've not reached that point yet.

640
00:52:58,583 --> 00:53:02,469
A change will do you good,
to leave Ferrara for a while.

641
00:53:02,554 --> 00:53:04,818
- Good night.
- Good night, Father.

642
00:53:05,757 --> 00:53:10,243
With all the 19- and 20-year-olds
they could draft...

643
00:53:10,328 --> 00:53:12,612
why do they put the bite on us?

644
00:53:12,697 --> 00:53:14,414
I've done my share.

645
00:53:14,499 --> 00:53:17,832
Eighteen months in Ethiopia,
malaria and dysentery included.

646
00:53:18,536 --> 00:53:20,731
Get someone else now!

647
00:53:21,673 --> 00:53:24,870
- Where are we?
- We just passed Novara.

648
00:53:24,976 --> 00:53:26,960
You're safe working at Fiat.

649
00:53:27,045 --> 00:53:29,095
Without your guns,
how do we fight?

650
00:53:29,180 --> 00:53:33,233
No, we're not safe.
Lots of our men have been called up.

651
00:53:33,318 --> 00:53:35,168
All I ask is to stay in Italy.

652
00:53:35,253 --> 00:53:38,238
Anything but Africa,
after what I saw.

653
00:53:38,323 --> 00:53:39,472
Move over.

654
00:53:39,557 --> 00:53:42,375
We really used poison gas?

655
00:53:42,460 --> 00:53:44,121
We sure did!

656
00:54:03,448 --> 00:54:05,473
Macaroni, vive la liberte!

657
00:54:25,136 --> 00:54:27,153
What a superb beard!
How are you?

658
00:54:27,238 --> 00:54:31,004
Fine! How about you
and Mother, Father and Fanny?

659
00:54:31,276 --> 00:54:33,267
Fine! We're all fine.

660
00:54:36,414 --> 00:54:39,699
So many soldiers.
Do they expect war to break out?

661
00:54:39,784 --> 00:54:42,402
Yes. A lot of us Italians
are here now.

662
00:54:42,487 --> 00:54:45,805
A Levi from Turin,
a Piperno from Rome.

663
00:54:45,890 --> 00:54:49,109
All of them students.
But youå€¤l soon meet them.

664
00:54:49,194 --> 00:54:51,911
In Italy, they think
France and England...

665
00:54:51,996 --> 00:54:54,781
will compromise again
at the last moment.

666
00:54:54,866 --> 00:54:59,633
The Italians know nothing.
You can't think when you don't know.

667
00:55:00,405 --> 00:55:03,897
For us, what is there
to look forward to now?

668
00:55:16,688 --> 00:55:19,239
They talk a lot about the Stuka.

669
00:55:19,324 --> 00:55:21,641
The call it ""the victory plane.""

670
00:55:21,726 --> 00:55:24,126
I bet it's nothing new.

671
00:55:24,996 --> 00:55:27,021
May I have the salt?

672
00:55:30,435 --> 00:55:32,652
What's that number on your arm?

673
00:55:32,737 --> 00:55:34,637
I'll tell you later.

674
00:55:40,044 --> 00:55:42,729
It was put on me at Dachau.

675
00:55:42,814 --> 00:55:45,131
Do they talk about Dachau
in Italy?

676
00:55:45,216 --> 00:55:47,343
No? What a pity.

677
00:55:48,253 --> 00:55:50,881
What is Dachau?

678
00:55:52,490 --> 00:55:55,482
It's a hotel in the woods.

679
00:55:57,028 --> 00:55:59,412
A hundred chalets,
all rooms without baths...

680
00:55:59,497 --> 00:56:01,314
a single latrine...

681
00:56:01,399 --> 00:56:04,027
surrounded by barbed wire.

682
00:56:04,836 --> 00:56:07,805
The service is provided by the SS.

683
00:56:08,873 --> 00:56:13,003
Instead of tagging our luggage,
they brand numbers on our flesh...

684
00:56:13,811 --> 00:56:17,611
as a souvenir of their hospitality.

685
00:56:28,526 --> 00:56:31,277
The guests at Dachau
are Jews, Communists...

686
00:56:31,362 --> 00:56:34,547
Socialists like me,
dissidents of all varieties.

687
00:56:34,632 --> 00:56:36,463
In other words...

688
00:56:37,568 --> 00:56:42,198
those whom the Nazis call
the dregs of the human race.

689
00:56:43,374 --> 00:56:46,159
I got out alive...

690
00:56:46,244 --> 00:56:47,827
because I'm a coward.

691
00:56:47,912 --> 00:56:52,042
I told them
I had become a Nazi.

692
00:56:53,251 --> 00:56:55,735
My brother didn't know
about any of this.

693
00:56:55,820 --> 00:56:58,380
So now he knows too.

694
00:57:10,635 --> 00:57:12,603
You really want to go back?

695
00:57:15,206 --> 00:57:19,734
I have too many ties
I can't bring with me.

696
00:57:21,312 --> 00:57:23,576
I'll see you.

697
00:58:57,041 --> 00:59:00,226
Giorgio, it's been ages!
I wondered where you were.

698
00:59:00,311 --> 00:59:02,428
I've missed you
at the Finzi-Continis.

699
00:59:02,513 --> 00:59:03,980
I've stopped going.

700
00:59:05,716 --> 00:59:08,241
And Micol?
What's she doing?

701
00:59:08,653 --> 00:59:12,851
She's the same as ever:
full of vitality, carefree.

702
00:59:13,357 --> 00:59:16,542
But not Alberto.
He never leaves his room now.

703
00:59:16,627 --> 00:59:19,145
He'd like to see you.

704
00:59:19,230 --> 00:59:20,891
And Adriana? How is she?

705
00:59:23,000 --> 00:59:24,350
That's all over.

706
00:59:24,435 --> 00:59:27,253
Mixed marriages are forbidden.

707
00:59:27,338 --> 00:59:30,933
She's engaged to a boy
from Bologna, I was told.

708
00:59:38,382 --> 00:59:40,800
It may be best for both of us.

709
00:59:40,885 --> 00:59:43,149
More so for her than me.

710
00:59:44,222 --> 00:59:47,521
- Let's get together.
- Yes, let's.

711
00:59:50,294 --> 00:59:55,014
By the way, you haven't been there
in so long. How come?

712
00:59:55,099 --> 00:59:57,483
- Women?
- Did they ask about me?

713
00:59:57,568 --> 00:59:59,559
Alberto did, several times.

714
01:00:01,305 --> 01:00:03,689
And Micol?
What's Micol doing?

715
01:00:03,774 --> 01:00:05,765
She translates English.

716
01:00:06,878 --> 01:00:09,608
She plays tennis
and never goes out.

717
01:00:11,949 --> 01:00:14,100
As if only the garden were safe.

718
01:00:14,185 --> 01:00:15,835
Like her brother.

719
01:00:15,920 --> 01:00:18,304
What shall we do? Go out?

720
01:00:18,389 --> 01:00:20,755
Do you prefer a woman
or a movie?

721
01:00:50,188 --> 01:00:53,783
- The clown!
- Bunch of riffraff!.

722
01:01:11,976 --> 01:01:14,494
I'd like to know what's so funny!

723
01:01:14,579 --> 01:01:18,709
- Stupid bastards!
- Get out, you dirty Jew!

724
01:01:21,152 --> 01:01:23,035
If I ever catch you--

725
01:01:23,120 --> 01:01:25,520
You're a real idiot.

726
01:01:27,091 --> 01:01:29,142
You can thank your God...

727
01:01:29,227 --> 01:01:32,025
the bum didn't know
you really are a Jew!

728
01:01:42,773 --> 01:01:44,423
A hell of a shot!

729
01:01:44,508 --> 01:01:46,292
If your aim's that good--

730
01:01:46,377 --> 01:01:49,328
- Try me.
- Slow down!

731
01:01:49,413 --> 01:01:51,230
Back home they say...

732
01:01:51,315 --> 01:01:52,732
"" Big nose and black pelt...

733
01:01:52,817 --> 01:01:55,445
you can't tell
what's below the belt.""

734
01:01:56,887 --> 01:01:58,604
What do I owe you?

735
01:01:58,689 --> 01:02:01,681
Beginner's luck!
Let's see you do it again.

736
01:02:33,357 --> 01:02:37,521
Please be sure you get it
good and level.

737
01:02:57,014 --> 01:02:59,005
Forgive me.

738
01:03:01,452 --> 01:03:03,569
Forgive me for disobeying.

739
01:03:03,654 --> 01:03:06,418
Today, I'm the one
who has something to say.

740
01:03:09,093 --> 01:03:11,911
Have you been in Ferrara
all along?

741
01:03:11,996 --> 01:03:13,946
More or less.

742
01:03:14,031 --> 01:03:17,016
One time I rode past the wall
on my bike.

743
01:03:17,101 --> 01:03:18,918
I saw you playing tennis.

744
01:03:19,003 --> 01:03:20,820
You and Malnate.

745
01:03:20,905 --> 01:03:24,557
You know, he and I have become
quite friendly.

746
01:03:24,642 --> 01:03:26,507
That's nice.

747
01:03:27,311 --> 01:03:30,029
You said you have
something to say.

748
01:03:30,114 --> 01:03:32,105
What is it?

749
01:03:35,186 --> 01:03:37,770
I just wanted to see you again.

750
01:03:37,855 --> 01:03:39,686
That's all.

751
01:03:42,426 --> 01:03:44,417
I love you.

752
01:03:45,629 --> 01:03:48,097
It's never happened to me before.

753
01:03:48,799 --> 01:03:51,666
And I know it never will again.

754
01:03:58,709 --> 01:04:01,803
But I don't love you!

755
01:04:06,350 --> 01:04:09,786
Lovers have a drive
to overwhelm one another.

756
01:04:10,154 --> 01:04:14,420
But the way we are,
alike as two drops of water...

757
01:04:15,226 --> 01:04:18,787
how could we ever overwhelm
or tear each other to pieces?

758
01:04:23,367 --> 01:04:26,768
It would be like making love
with a brother.

759
01:04:27,037 --> 01:04:29,028
Like with Alberto.

760
01:04:34,178 --> 01:04:37,113
You and I are not normal people.

761
01:04:41,352 --> 01:04:42,735
For the two of us...

762
01:04:42,820 --> 01:04:46,517
what counts more
than the possession of things--

763
01:04:46,991 --> 01:04:49,152
how shall I put it?--

764
01:04:49,960 --> 01:04:52,929
is the remembrance of things...

765
01:04:53,230 --> 01:04:55,528
the memory of things.

766
01:04:57,268 --> 01:04:58,751
Isn't that so?

767
01:04:58,836 --> 01:05:01,120
I wonder.

768
01:05:01,205 --> 01:05:03,173
It may simply be that...

769
01:05:03,808 --> 01:05:05,991
you don't like me physically.

770
01:05:06,076 --> 01:05:07,236
That's all.

771
01:05:07,978 --> 01:05:10,776
Don't talk such nonsense.

772
01:05:13,851 --> 01:05:15,512
There's no connection.

773
01:05:16,120 --> 01:05:17,849
Yes, there is!

774
01:05:20,291 --> 01:05:21,952
And you know it.

775
01:05:24,528 --> 01:05:25,961
Unless--

776
01:05:26,230 --> 01:05:27,891
Unless what?

777
01:05:28,599 --> 01:05:31,193
Unless there's someone else.

778
01:05:31,602 --> 01:05:34,366
There's absolutely no one.

779
01:05:35,239 --> 01:05:36,934
Who could there be?

780
01:05:37,441 --> 01:05:39,432
Why ask me?

781
01:05:40,377 --> 01:05:42,311
It could be anyone.

782
01:05:46,083 --> 01:05:48,847
What else can I say, Micol?

783
01:05:50,654 --> 01:05:54,454
I can't even persuade you
to let me love you.

784
01:05:55,459 --> 01:05:57,359
I'm so helpless.

785
01:06:00,264 --> 01:06:03,028
If anything happens to you...

786
01:06:03,901 --> 01:06:05,892
the fault will be mine.

787
01:06:18,883 --> 01:06:20,942
I'll never come here again.

788
01:06:25,189 --> 01:06:27,919
I'll never come again
to this garden.

789
01:07:01,358 --> 01:07:04,343
Il Duce will make an address
in one hour...

790
01:07:04,428 --> 01:07:06,453
to the entire nation.

791
01:07:06,830 --> 01:07:08,380
Italians...

792
01:07:08,465 --> 01:07:09,782
Fascists...

793
01:07:09,867 --> 01:07:13,519
you will hear the announcement
of an historic event.

794
01:07:13,604 --> 01:07:15,970
Duce! Duce! Duce!

795
01:07:39,096 --> 01:07:41,462
Shut up! Shut up!

796
01:07:43,300 --> 01:07:45,017
What is it? What's wrong?

797
01:07:45,102 --> 01:07:48,868
Italy's declared war!
The Duce is speaking!

798
01:08:17,401 --> 01:08:19,062
Well, say something!

799
01:08:26,644 --> 01:08:26,659
Giorgio? Is that you?

800
01:08:26,744 --> 01:08:28,694
Giorgio? Is that you?

801
01:08:28,779 --> 01:08:30,940
Why haven't I seen you?

802
01:08:31,815 --> 01:08:34,700
Let's get together.
No, Sunday's too late.

803
01:08:34,785 --> 01:08:36,569
I'll be gone.

804
01:08:36,654 --> 01:08:38,519
I've been called up.

805
01:08:39,790 --> 01:08:41,724
Yes, they caught me.

806
01:08:43,060 --> 01:08:46,045
First to Bologna.
Then who knows?

807
01:08:46,130 --> 01:08:49,415
I only hope I'm not sent to Russia.

808
01:08:49,500 --> 01:08:52,264
Fine. I'll see you later.

809
01:09:02,346 --> 01:09:04,029
Why donç¨š you visit them?

810
01:09:04,114 --> 01:09:06,981
- Why havenç¨š you gone?
- I can't.

811
01:09:10,054 --> 01:09:12,249
Are things that bad with Micol?

812
01:09:14,658 --> 01:09:17,183
I loved her so terribly much.

813
01:09:21,265 --> 01:09:23,849
If you knew
how much she likes you...

814
01:09:23,934 --> 01:09:26,151
how she sticks up for you.

815
01:09:26,236 --> 01:09:29,034
Alberto likes and respects you too.

816
01:09:32,376 --> 01:09:34,994
I have no use...

817
01:09:35,079 --> 01:09:37,029
for their liking or their respect.

818
01:09:37,114 --> 01:09:39,412
I think youæ± e wrong.

819
01:09:40,084 --> 01:09:42,901
Whatever happened
between you and Micol...

820
01:09:42,986 --> 01:09:45,648
your friendship is worth saving.

821
01:09:46,090 --> 01:09:48,217
Excuse me for asking...

822
01:09:48,826 --> 01:09:51,677
but did you ever even kiss her?

823
01:09:51,762 --> 01:09:54,993
Once. Yes, I did, just once.

824
01:09:55,466 --> 01:09:57,249
Let's not talk about it.

825
01:09:57,334 --> 01:09:59,585
At a time like this...

826
01:09:59,670 --> 01:10:02,400
my broken heart is absurd.

827
01:10:02,873 --> 01:10:04,864
Now youæ± e leaving too.

828
01:10:05,242 --> 01:10:07,226
Will you write me?

829
01:10:07,311 --> 01:10:09,061
We'll see each other again.

830
01:10:09,146 --> 01:10:13,173
When I'm off duty,
I'll spend Sundays in Ferrara.

831
01:10:14,551 --> 01:10:18,612
It's midnight! I must go
or I'll never wake up!

832
01:10:19,490 --> 01:10:21,740
Good luck!

833
01:10:21,825 --> 01:10:24,623
- You too!
- I'll need it.

834
01:10:37,708 --> 01:10:39,903
Be of good cheer!

835
01:14:32,976 --> 01:14:34,526
This is London.

836
01:14:34,611 --> 01:14:37,529
Soviet forces
are fighting magnificently...

837
01:14:37,614 --> 01:14:39,564
in defense of Moscow.

838
01:14:39,649 --> 01:14:43,535
The Nazi forces are encountering
stiff resistance.

839
01:14:43,620 --> 01:14:45,281
Stalin--

840
01:14:47,557 --> 01:14:49,491
Is that you, Giorgio?

841
01:14:50,494 --> 01:14:52,359
Yes, Father.

842
01:14:55,899 --> 01:14:59,151
You know what time it is? 2:25.

843
01:14:59,236 --> 01:15:01,586
I went out.

844
01:15:01,671 --> 01:15:04,299
With your friend from Milan?

845
01:15:08,245 --> 01:15:09,837
What's the news?

846
01:15:11,782 --> 01:15:14,399
The Germans are outside of Moscow.

847
01:15:14,484 --> 01:15:17,612
You think they can be driven back?
I doubt it.

848
01:15:18,388 --> 01:15:20,379
I think they can.

849
01:15:21,224 --> 01:15:23,715
But if they fail...

850
01:15:26,229 --> 01:15:28,163
then it's really the end.

851
01:15:41,511 --> 01:15:43,206
Look, Giorgio...

852
01:15:43,980 --> 01:15:46,210
how are things with Micol?

853
01:15:52,689 --> 01:15:55,807
Forgive me for bringing up
this subject...

854
01:15:55,892 --> 01:15:57,943
but your mother and I...

855
01:15:58,028 --> 01:15:59,723
have been aware.

856
01:16:01,031 --> 01:16:03,226
Things are so bad...

857
01:16:03,934 --> 01:16:06,562
they couldn't be any worse.

858
01:16:10,307 --> 01:16:12,298
It's all over.

859
01:16:13,777 --> 01:16:16,974
Oh, yes, I know how painful
that can be.

860
01:16:18,482 --> 01:16:20,973
But in the long run, it's best.

861
01:16:21,485 --> 01:16:24,147
You really wanted to be engaged?

862
01:16:25,021 --> 01:16:27,012
Engaged, and maybe marry...

863
01:16:27,657 --> 01:16:29,750
at a time like this?

864
01:16:31,661 --> 01:16:34,027
If I may say so...

865
01:16:34,364 --> 01:16:38,617
as families go,
the Finzi-Continis are not for us.

866
01:16:38,702 --> 01:16:41,753
They're not our sort.
They're different.

867
01:16:41,838 --> 01:16:44,272
They don't even seem Jewish.

868
01:16:47,043 --> 01:16:51,329
Micol-- Maybe that's what
attracted you to her.

869
01:16:51,414 --> 01:16:54,747
That she's superior to you
socially.

870
01:16:55,785 --> 01:16:57,116
It'll pass.

871
01:16:59,623 --> 01:17:01,557
You'll get over it.

872
01:17:02,225 --> 01:17:05,285
And a lot sooner than you think.

873
01:17:07,397 --> 01:17:10,195
I can imagine
what youæ± e feeling now.

874
01:17:10,600 --> 01:17:13,251
Yet, in a way,
I rather envy you.

875
01:17:13,336 --> 01:17:15,720
In life, in order to understand...

876
01:17:15,805 --> 01:17:18,457
to really understand the world...

877
01:17:18,542 --> 01:17:20,826
you must die at least once.

878
01:17:20,911 --> 01:17:25,197
So it's better to die young,
when there's still time left...

879
01:17:25,282 --> 01:17:27,999
to recover and live again.

880
01:17:28,084 --> 01:17:30,869
When you're old, it's much worse.

881
01:17:30,954 --> 01:17:32,537
Why is that?

882
01:17:32,622 --> 01:17:35,507
There's no time
to start over from zero.

883
01:17:35,592 --> 01:17:40,029
And our generation has made
so many, many mistakes.

884
01:17:40,697 --> 01:17:45,717
A few months and it will seem as if
none of this had ever happened to you.

885
01:17:45,802 --> 01:17:48,320
You may even end up being glad.

886
01:17:48,405 --> 01:17:51,656
You'll feel richer,
one might say.

887
01:17:51,741 --> 01:17:53,003
More mature.

888
01:17:55,612 --> 01:17:57,136
Let's hope so.

889
01:18:02,752 --> 01:18:04,736
I'm happy all that came out...

890
01:18:04,821 --> 01:18:07,949
and I got this load off my chest.

891
01:18:10,093 --> 01:18:13,345
How about catching some sleep?
You need it.

892
01:18:13,430 --> 01:18:16,948
I'll try to close my eyes
a few minutes too.

893
01:18:17,033 --> 01:18:18,967
Good night.

894
01:19:44,988 --> 01:19:47,456
Go up to Alberto.

895
01:19:49,993 --> 01:19:52,359
I couldn't lie to him.

896
01:20:04,207 --> 01:20:06,004
Air raid!

897
01:21:16,312 --> 01:21:19,338
Young man, try your luck!

898
01:21:20,016 --> 01:21:21,984
No, thanks.

899
01:21:29,426 --> 01:21:31,576
Hey, I know you!

900
01:21:31,661 --> 01:21:33,845
Before this stinking war started...

901
01:21:33,930 --> 01:21:36,815
you came with your friend--
my friend too.

902
01:21:36,900 --> 01:21:38,128
Malnate?

903
01:21:42,505 --> 01:21:44,735
He was killed in Russia.

904
01:21:49,479 --> 01:21:52,130
And you--
how did you dodge it?

905
01:21:52,215 --> 01:21:54,240
They didn't want me.
I'm a Jew.

906
01:21:54,851 --> 01:21:56,785
A Jew!

907
01:21:57,587 --> 01:22:00,317
- Beat it! Go away!
- Why?

908
01:22:00,757 --> 01:22:03,975
They're hunting Jews.
They'll grab you anywhere!

909
01:22:04,060 --> 01:22:05,550
Beat it! Go away!

910
01:22:16,439 --> 01:22:19,374
An eight-hour patrol
is too long!

911
01:22:57,614 --> 01:22:59,445
Signor Lattes?

912
01:23:02,385 --> 01:23:04,751
Kindly come with us.

913
01:23:06,122 --> 01:23:09,874
- To the police?
- Just a formality. A few minutes.

914
01:23:09,959 --> 01:23:11,756
Please.

915
01:23:40,290 --> 01:23:41,780
Stop!

916
01:23:46,529 --> 01:23:48,997
There he goes! That way!

917
01:23:50,867 --> 01:23:52,835
Stop!

918
01:24:23,633 --> 01:24:25,624
Open up.

919
01:25:51,821 --> 01:25:53,504
This way!

920
01:25:53,589 --> 01:25:55,784
Go in the other room.

921
01:26:22,251 --> 01:26:24,869
Finzi-Contini, Prof. Ermanno.

922
01:26:24,954 --> 01:26:26,785
Here.

923
01:26:33,563 --> 01:26:35,895
Finzi-Contini, Olga.

924
01:26:38,334 --> 01:26:41,326
Arton, Regina in Herrera.

925
01:26:43,106 --> 01:26:45,438
Finzi-Contini, Alberto.

926
01:26:47,677 --> 01:26:49,577
He died six months ago.

927
01:26:52,448 --> 01:26:54,678
Finzi-Contini, Nicole.

928
01:26:55,084 --> 01:26:56,574
Micol.

929
01:28:47,330 --> 01:28:49,714
- Ascoli in Levi.
- Present.

930
01:28:49,799 --> 01:28:52,049
- Lattes, Magda.
- Present.

931
01:28:52,134 --> 01:28:53,863
Lattes, Luigi.

932
01:28:54,737 --> 01:28:56,864
Ancona, Olga.

933
01:28:57,106 --> 01:28:59,233
Ascoli, Elisa.

934
01:28:59,909 --> 01:29:01,900
This is for Montanari.

935
01:29:03,246 --> 01:29:05,646
Move. Let us through.

936
01:29:06,883 --> 01:29:09,467
All who've been called
and the newcomers--

937
01:29:09,552 --> 01:29:11,302
Take this to Montanari.

938
01:29:11,387 --> 01:29:14,185
Follow me. Line up.

939
01:29:16,125 --> 01:29:18,059
Please.

940
01:29:19,195 --> 01:29:20,890
Let's go!

941
01:29:41,384 --> 01:29:43,409
Faster, faster!

942
01:30:23,592 --> 01:30:25,492
Go on.

943
01:30:28,831 --> 01:30:30,492
Stop.

944
01:30:37,740 --> 01:30:39,605
Make room.

945
01:30:47,116 --> 01:30:49,209
Inside, please.

946
01:31:49,178 --> 01:31:51,237
Finzi-Contini, finished yet?

947
01:31:54,450 --> 01:31:56,111
Good-bye.

948
01:32:05,728 --> 01:32:07,320
You're here too.

949
01:32:08,564 --> 01:32:11,294
We're all here,
but they've separated us.

950
01:32:13,502 --> 01:32:15,800
They took me away last night.

951
01:32:18,641 --> 01:32:21,559
Not Giorgio, just me.

952
01:32:21,644 --> 01:32:24,528
Giorgio, my wife and Fanny should be
far away by now...

953
01:32:24,613 --> 01:32:26,931
and hopefully they made it.

954
01:32:27,016 --> 01:32:28,916
Thank God!

955
01:32:36,559 --> 01:32:39,744
- Where will they take us?
- Who knows?

956
01:32:39,829 --> 01:32:43,390
Pray to God they at least
let us stay together, Micol...

957
01:32:43,833 --> 01:32:46,267
those of us from Ferrara.

958
01:34:15,357 --> 01:34:20,124
""This Film Won the Golden Bear Award
