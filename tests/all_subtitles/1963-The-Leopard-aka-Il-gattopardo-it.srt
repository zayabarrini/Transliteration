sicut erat in principio nunc et
semper in secula saeculorum. Amen.

7
00:03:05,727 --> 00:03:10,648
The second mystery consists in
Jesus' flagellation by the pillar.

8
00:03:10,732 --> 00:03:13,902
Pater noster qui es in coelis
sanctificatur nomen tuum,

9
00:03:13,985 --> 00:03:17,447
adveniat regnum tuum, fiat voluntas
tua sicut in coela et in terra,

10
00:03:17,530 --> 00:03:22,452
panem nostrum quotidianum da nobis
hodie, dimitte nobis debita nostra

11
00:03:22,535 --> 00:03:25,080
sicut nos dimittimus
debitorum nostris

12
00:03:25,205 --> 00:03:29,376
et ne nos inducat in tentationem
sed libera nos a malo. Amen.

37
00:04:44,784 --> 00:04:52,208
Where are you going ?
You can't go ! Come back !

38
00:04:52,292 --> 00:04:55,462
Ave Maria, gratia plena, Dominus
tecum, benedicta tu in mulieribus,

39
00:04:55,545 --> 00:04:57,839
et benedictus fructus ventris

40
00:04:57,922 --> 00:05:01,968
Sancta Maria, Mater Dei,
ora pro nobis peccatoribus,

41
00:05:02,052 --> 00:05:04,846
nunc et in hora mortis nostrae.
Amen.

42
00:05:04,929 --> 00:05:08,767
Ave Maria, gratia plena, Dominus
tecum, benedicta tu in mulieribus,

43
00:05:08,892 --> 00:05:10,935
et benedictus fructus...

44
00:05:42,133 --> 00:05:44,177
What's all this fuss about ?

45
00:05:45,136 --> 00:05:49,516
- What happened ? Speak up !
- Excellency, please, forgive us...

46
00:05:49,599 --> 00:05:52,602
but they found
a dead soldier in the garden.

47
00:05:52,686 --> 00:05:54,729
What ?

48
00:05:56,523 --> 00:06:00,819
Terrible riots are taking place
all over the country.

49
00:06:00,902 --> 00:06:04,489
They brought this letter
from the Duke of Malvica.

50
00:06:04,572 --> 00:06:07,117
He says it's a very urgent matter.

51
00:06:15,291 --> 00:06:19,212
''Dear Fabrizio, read the horrible
news on the newspaper.

52
00:06:24,426 --> 00:06:28,221
The Piedmontese have landed,
we're lost.

53
00:06:29,889 --> 00:06:32,726
Tonight, my whole family and I
will take shelter

54
00:06:32,809 --> 00:06:37,564
on the English ships at anchor.
I'm sure you'll do the same.

55
00:06:42,360 --> 00:06:46,656
God save our beloved King.
I hug you.'' What a coward !

56
00:06:50,994 --> 00:06:53,997
''An act of piracy was committed
on the 1 1th of May

57
00:06:54,080 --> 00:06:57,250
after the landing
of armed people in Marsala.

58
00:06:57,334 --> 00:07:01,379
It has subsequently been discovered
that it was the 800 men

59
00:07:01,463 --> 00:07:03,506
driven by Garibaldi.

60
00:07:06,426 --> 00:07:11,056
The bandits were able to avoid a
confrontation with the royal troops

61
00:07:11,139 --> 00:07:15,852
by heading to Castelvetrano, where
they harmed the peaceful citizens

62
00:07:15,935 --> 00:07:19,856
- ..with robberies and
devastations.'' - Garibaldi !

63
00:07:20,815 --> 00:07:24,069
Paolo, you must move
to the Palermo palace.

64
00:07:24,152 --> 00:07:27,280
- If we leave a house empty,
we'll lose it. - No, please !

65
00:07:27,364 --> 00:07:29,908
Fabrizio, it's too dangerous !

66
00:07:30,033 --> 00:07:34,704
Fabrizio, don't ! Don't !
We're at war !

67
00:07:34,788 --> 00:07:37,874
- Francesco Paolo, call Mimì.
- Yes, father.

68
00:07:40,835 --> 00:07:43,296
Mimì ! Mimì !

69
00:07:45,423 --> 00:07:47,467
This is a revolution !

70
00:07:50,470 --> 00:07:53,682
Mon Dieu ! C'est sa crise !
Oh, Madame !

71
00:07:59,729 --> 00:08:01,773
Les gouttes !

72
00:08:01,856 --> 00:08:05,276
I'm suffocating !

73
00:08:05,360 --> 00:08:08,405
Concetta, dépêche toi ! Vite !

74
00:08:11,658 --> 00:08:16,621
Voilà, Madame, voilà.
Buvez ça et ça ira mieux.

75
00:08:16,705 --> 00:08:22,836
Mimì ! Domenico !
Mimì !

76
00:08:24,963 --> 00:08:29,342
- Mimì's coming, dad.
- Dad ! - Mimì ! - Dad !

77
00:08:29,426 --> 00:08:32,637
- Your Excellency, forgive me,
but we found a dead... - I know !

78
00:08:32,721 --> 00:08:37,726
Mimì, go tell Don Antonio to hitch
the bays to the coupé. Go, go !

79
00:08:42,897 --> 00:08:46,568
- I'll head to Palermo right
after dinner. - Yes, Excellency.

80
00:08:48,153 --> 00:08:50,613
- Father Pirrone.
- Yes ?

81
00:08:50,697 --> 00:08:53,783
- You'll go with me.
- Me ? - Right.

82
00:08:56,619 --> 00:08:58,663
God protect us.

83
00:09:00,165 --> 00:09:04,919
Fabrizio !
The streets are full of soldiers !

84
00:09:05,003 --> 00:09:07,047
Stella, calm down.

85
00:09:08,381 --> 00:09:11,509
You'll spend two hours with your
friends at Casa Professa.

86
00:09:11,593 --> 00:09:15,221
- We'll be back by eleven.
- Fine, Excellency.

87
00:09:28,026 --> 00:09:31,112
We're gonna have lunch
in half an hour.

88
00:09:32,155 --> 00:09:34,199
All of us !

89
00:09:53,134 --> 00:09:56,221
- What shall we do ? - Salve
Regina, Mater misericordiae,

90
00:09:56,304 --> 00:09:58,556
vita, dulcedo et spes nostra,
salve.

91
00:09:58,640 --> 00:10:02,852
A te clamamos exule filii Hevae,
a te suspiramus gementes et flentes

92
00:10:02,936 --> 00:10:06,398
in hac lacrimarum valle.
Eja ergo advocata nostra,

93
00:10:06,481 --> 00:10:09,442
illos tuos misericordiae oculos
ad nos convertes.

94
00:10:09,526 --> 00:10:14,447
Et Jesus benedictum fructus ventris
tui, nobis hoc exilium ostende.

95
00:10:14,531 --> 00:10:18,451
O clemens, o pia,
o dulcis Virgo Maria.

96
00:10:18,576 --> 00:10:22,247
The stench of these swines doesn't
stop even when they're dead.

97
00:10:22,330 --> 00:10:25,417
- Salvatore, did you inform
the barracks ? - Yes sir.

98
00:10:26,334 --> 00:10:30,463
Excellency, we've already told
the barracks to come and get him.

99
00:10:49,733 --> 00:10:52,819
Awful times, Excellency,
awful times.

100
00:11:00,994 --> 00:11:04,080
Excellency, look at the fires
on the mountains !

101
00:11:07,334 --> 00:11:11,463
- They're the rebels' camps.
- I can see them myself, Father.

102
00:11:21,973 --> 00:11:26,102
ls Your Excellency by any chance
worried about Don Tancredi ?

103
00:11:29,230 --> 00:11:36,529
Don Tancredi should avoid
bad and dangerous company.

104
00:11:36,613 --> 00:11:42,077
- It is not Tancredi's fault !
It's the times' ! - Yes, I agree.

105
00:11:42,160 --> 00:11:44,621
Nowadays,
a young man of good family

106
00:11:44,704 --> 00:11:48,375
can't even play cards without
running into dangerous people.

107
00:11:48,500 --> 00:11:51,920
- Yes, I understand, Excellency.
- Stop it, then.

108
00:11:53,505 --> 00:11:58,426
- Even though, a little bit
of caution... - Oh, come on !

109
00:12:00,470 --> 00:12:04,599
Stop !
Sergeant ! Sergeant !

110
00:12:04,683 --> 00:12:07,143
Checkpoint of Villa Airoldi !

111
00:12:07,268 --> 00:12:10,897
- Good evening, Excellency. - Good
evening. - I'm sorry, Excellency.

112
00:12:10,980 --> 00:12:15,276
Let them pass. It is His Excellency
the Prince Salina.

113
00:12:15,360 --> 00:12:18,196
- Good-bye, Excellence.
- Good-bye.

114
00:12:18,279 --> 00:12:20,323
Let them pass !

115
00:12:29,332 --> 00:12:32,961
This country would be wonderful,
Excellency, if...

116
00:12:33,044 --> 00:12:35,922
If there were not so many Jesuits !

117
00:12:48,393 --> 00:12:53,231
I'll come and pick you up in two
hours. And... enjoy your prayers.

118
00:12:53,314 --> 00:12:54,941
Let's go !

119
00:13:20,884 --> 00:13:25,847
- Where could we go ?
- At the inn by the harbor. - Yes.

120
00:13:30,352 --> 00:13:32,395
Good evening, handsome sir !

121
00:13:33,396 --> 00:13:38,360
- Melina, he's not for you. - Leave
me alone, mind your own business.

122
00:13:42,530 --> 00:13:44,574
My dear Prince !

123
00:14:17,482 --> 00:14:20,568
- Hello, Uncle.
- Tancredi !

124
00:14:22,070 --> 00:14:25,031
- What were you up to,
last night, huh ? - Last night ?

125
00:14:25,115 --> 00:14:28,952
Absolutely nothing, Uncle !
I was with friends.

126
00:14:29,077 --> 00:14:31,204
It was a caste night.

127
00:14:31,287 --> 00:14:36,251
Whereas I know about people
who were having fun in Palermo.

128
00:14:37,377 --> 00:14:42,048
- Like whom ?
- Well, yourself, Uncle.

129
00:14:42,132 --> 00:14:44,592
I saw you with my own eyes
at Villa Airoldi

130
00:14:44,718 --> 00:14:48,346
talking to the Sergeant
by the checkpoint.

131
00:14:48,430 --> 00:14:53,059
You're too old for that !
Plus, with a Reverend Father !

132
00:14:53,143 --> 00:14:58,064
- Oh, the libertine remainings !
- Well, it's true, after all.

133
00:15:03,069 --> 00:15:04,696
Mimì ?

134
00:15:19,044 --> 00:15:22,255
Why are you dressed like that ?
What's going on ?

135
00:15:22,339 --> 00:15:26,801
- A morning costume ball ?
- I'm leaving in an hour.

136
00:15:26,885 --> 00:15:29,721
- I'm here to say good-bye.
- Why ?

137
00:15:30,889 --> 00:15:34,059
Where are you going ?
It's not a duel, is it ?

138
00:15:34,142 --> 00:15:39,564
Yes, a big one: a duel with the
King, with ''Franceschiello''.

139
00:15:39,647 --> 00:15:42,067
I'm going to the mountains,
up to Ficuzza.

140
00:15:42,150 --> 00:15:46,488
Something great is going to happen,
and I don't want to stay at home.

141
00:15:46,571 --> 00:15:50,450
- Even if I did, they'd get me
right away ! - Are you crazy ?

142
00:15:50,533 --> 00:15:53,703
Those people are mafia men !
They're all crooks !

143
00:15:56,498 --> 00:16:00,960
- A Falconeri ought to stay with
us, on the King's side ! - Sure !

144
00:16:02,962 --> 00:16:07,008
What king, though ? You've
said it yourself so many times:

145
00:16:07,092 --> 00:16:09,427
''If only King Ferdinando
was still alive !''.

146
00:16:09,511 --> 00:16:13,264
But Franceschiello...
No, dear uncle, no way.

147
00:16:13,390 --> 00:16:17,143
Do you think that the so-called
''Gentleman'' will be better ?

148
00:16:17,268 --> 00:16:20,230
He'll speak Turin dialect instead
of Neapolitan ! That's it !

149
00:16:20,313 --> 00:16:23,400
What about
Don Peppino Mazzini's Republic ?

150
00:16:24,651 --> 00:16:27,529
Believe me, Uncle,
if it weren't for us,

151
00:16:27,612 --> 00:16:31,241
they'd set up a republic
in no time.

152
00:16:31,324 --> 00:16:36,621
For everything to remain the same,
everything must change !

153
00:16:36,705 --> 00:16:38,748
Did I make myself clear ?

154
00:16:42,752 --> 00:16:45,964
I'll see you soon, Uncle.
I'll be back with the Tricolor !

155
00:16:47,716 --> 00:16:49,759
The Tricolor !

156
00:16:50,260 --> 00:16:54,139
You all fill your mouth up
with this word !

157
00:16:54,222 --> 00:16:57,976
What is it compared to our
white banner with the golden lily ?

158
00:16:58,101 --> 00:17:01,229
- What good will
a clash of colors do ? - Wait.

159
00:17:01,312 --> 00:17:04,607
- And you'll see I'm right.
- You're a dreamer !

160
00:17:04,691 --> 00:17:06,317
Good-bye, Uncle.

161
00:17:11,948 --> 00:17:12,949
Good-bye.

162
00:17:16,703 --> 00:17:18,747
See you soon !

163
00:17:29,924 --> 00:17:33,636
- Bye, Rosalia, see you soon.
- Au revoir, Tancredi.

164
00:17:34,888 --> 00:17:36,931
- Carolina.
- Good-bye.

165
00:17:38,725 --> 00:17:40,769
- Bye !
- Bye.

166
00:17:43,772 --> 00:17:45,523
Good-bye.

167
00:17:45,607 --> 00:17:52,113
- Good-bye ! - Good-bye !
- Au revoir, Tancredi ! - Bye !

168
00:18:04,292 --> 00:18:05,919
Tancredi.

169
00:18:06,378 --> 00:18:07,379
Wait.

170
00:18:11,007 --> 00:18:13,051
Uncle...

171
00:18:15,887 --> 00:18:20,475
What are you doing ? You won't
support the revolution, will you ?

172
00:18:20,558 --> 00:18:22,602
Thank you so much, Uncle.

173
00:18:23,812 --> 00:18:26,606
See you soon !
Give my aunt a hug for me !

174
00:18:31,152 --> 00:18:33,196
Tancredi !

175
00:18:40,245 --> 00:18:43,540
Concetta, don't.
I'll be back soon.

176
00:18:45,041 --> 00:18:46,042
Bye.

177
00:18:48,670 --> 00:18:50,964
Bye, Concettina, see you soon.

178
00:18:54,300 --> 00:18:55,927
Let's go.

179
00:19:34,174 --> 00:19:38,553
- Good morning, Excellency.
- Good morning, Father.

180
00:19:38,636 --> 00:19:43,683
- ls Your Excellency here
to confess ? - It's not Saturday.

181
00:19:50,857 --> 00:19:54,277
Excellency, you should
listen to me and confess.

182
00:19:58,114 --> 00:20:02,786
You see, Father, there's no need,
you already know everything.

183
00:20:09,000 --> 00:20:13,254
- Confession isn't simply
telling our sins. - I know...

184
00:20:13,338 --> 00:20:17,634
- It consists in repenting
for them. - I know !

185
00:20:17,717 --> 00:20:21,179
What do you want from me ?
I'm a vigorous man.

186
00:20:21,262 --> 00:20:26,851
I can't be content with a woman who
crosses herself before hugging me !

187
00:20:26,935 --> 00:20:31,064
And who, afterwards,
can only say ''Jesus and Mary'' !

188
00:20:31,147 --> 00:20:33,525
I had seven kids with her.

189
00:20:33,608 --> 00:20:38,822
You know what ?
I never saw her navel !

190
00:20:41,157 --> 00:20:44,244
It this fair ? I'm asking you,
Father, is it fair ?

191
00:20:44,327 --> 00:20:46,371
She is the sinner.

192
00:20:50,417 --> 00:20:52,460
Excellency...

193
00:20:53,211 --> 00:20:55,672
I'm afraid I was too brusque.

194
00:20:57,007 --> 00:20:59,050
Please, forgive me.

195
00:21:04,222 --> 00:21:07,058
But do listen to me:
come to confession !

196
00:21:07,642 --> 00:21:10,729
It doesn't even cross my mind !

197
00:21:12,063 --> 00:21:14,107
Not today, at least.

198
00:21:16,735 --> 00:21:19,821
I made a few important
political discoveries.

199
00:21:20,572 --> 00:21:25,577
Do you know what's going on
in our country ? Nothing at all.

200
00:21:25,660 --> 00:21:28,747
Just an imperceptible
change in ranks.

201
00:21:30,040 --> 00:21:33,293
The middle-classes
don't want to destroy us,

202
00:21:33,376 --> 00:21:37,422
they just want to take our place,
kindly, though,

203
00:21:37,505 --> 00:21:41,343
maybe slipping a few thousand
ducats in our pockets.

204
00:21:41,468 --> 00:21:45,180
And then, everything
will be the same as ever.

205
00:21:45,263 --> 00:21:49,559
You see, Father, we live
in the country of arrangements.

206
00:21:49,642 --> 00:21:53,980
ln a few words, sir, you plan on
coming to terms with the Liberals.

207
00:21:54,064 --> 00:21:56,107
Even, with the Masons.

208
00:21:56,983 --> 00:21:59,652
At our expense,
at the expense of the Church.

209
00:21:59,736 --> 00:22:04,366
It is obvious that all our riches,
that actually belong to the poor,

210
00:22:04,449 --> 00:22:09,245
will be grabbed by and split among
the most impudent ringleaders.

211
00:22:09,329 --> 00:22:15,377
What will become of those destitute
the Church feeds and guides ?

212
00:22:15,460 --> 00:22:19,130
How will those desperate
be pacified ? I'll tell you.

213
00:22:19,255 --> 00:22:25,261
We'll give them all your lands,
bit by bit !

214
00:22:30,767 --> 00:22:33,395
Our Lord healed the blind in body,

215
00:22:33,478 --> 00:22:37,148
but what will become
of the blind in spirit ?

216
00:22:43,113 --> 00:22:46,199
We're not blind in spirit,
dear Father.

217
00:22:48,535 --> 00:22:53,581
We're just human beings living
in a world that's changing.

218
00:22:53,707 --> 00:22:56,251
What are we supposed to do ?

219
00:22:56,376 --> 00:23:00,130
The Church was explicitly
promised immortality.

220
00:23:00,213 --> 00:23:02,757
As a social class,
we were promised nothing.

221
00:23:02,882 --> 00:23:08,596
To us, eternity adds up
to a hundred years !

222
00:23:08,680 --> 00:23:13,059
We have no obligation beyond
what we can see with our own eyes.

223
00:23:13,143 --> 00:23:18,690
The Church does,
because it is bound to last.

224
00:23:18,773 --> 00:23:21,818
- Comfort is implicit in its
desperation. - Excellency !

225
00:23:21,901 --> 00:23:25,572
Do you think, Father, that if
one day the Church had the chance

226
00:23:25,655 --> 00:23:30,368
to save itself sacrificing us,
it would hesitate ?

227
00:23:32,162 --> 00:23:35,832
It wouldn't, but that's fair.

228
00:23:46,134 --> 00:23:49,512
You'll have two sins to confess,
on Saturday, Excellency:

229
00:23:49,596 --> 00:23:55,268
last night's carnal sin,
and today's spiritual. Remember.

230
00:23:55,352 --> 00:23:59,105
Look at this beauty, Father.

231
00:24:00,148 --> 00:24:03,193
It'll take more than Vittorio
Emanuele to deprive us

232
00:24:03,276 --> 00:24:06,363
of the magic potion
we daily get to drink.

233
00:25:39,080 --> 00:25:41,124
Let him go !

234
00:25:47,922 --> 00:25:52,177
Come on, hurry, quick !
Come on !

235
00:25:54,679 --> 00:25:56,848
Aim ! Fire !

236
00:26:03,355 --> 00:26:08,234
Go away, you traitors !
You rogues ! Go away !

237
00:26:12,572 --> 00:26:17,327
- Get him ! Get him !
- Traitor ! - Stop him !

238
00:26:28,380 --> 00:26:29,798
Here he is !

239
00:26:42,811 --> 00:26:47,941
- Let me go ! I'm innocent !
No ! No ! - Traitor !

240
00:26:50,026 --> 00:26:53,863
- Let's hang him !
- Let's hang him !

241
00:26:55,156 --> 00:26:57,867
I'm innocent !
Let me go !

242
00:26:58,660 --> 00:27:01,746
- Murderer !
- Help ! Let me go !

243
00:27:02,288 --> 00:27:05,375
- Let's hang him !
- Coward !

244
00:27:49,586 --> 00:27:51,629
Let's go !

245
00:27:56,634 --> 00:27:58,678
All clear, go !

246
00:28:20,700 --> 00:28:23,411
Keep to the wall !
Follow me !

247
00:28:32,504 --> 00:28:36,174
- Come ! Come !
- That way ! That way !

248
00:28:36,257 --> 00:28:39,928
- Save us ! Save us !
- The Garibaldians are here !

249
00:28:40,011 --> 00:28:42,931
- Help me !
- Here ! Come here !

250
00:28:47,102 --> 00:28:50,814
He's a murderer ! Let's take
the law into our own hands !

251
00:28:50,897 --> 00:28:52,941
- He's a coward !
- Careful !

252
00:28:55,485 --> 00:28:57,487
Come on, follow me !

253
00:29:02,158 --> 00:29:06,079
- The cavalry !
- Don't fire, not yet ! Wait !

254
00:29:07,914 --> 00:29:09,958
Fire !

255
00:29:18,008 --> 00:29:20,051
Fire !

256
00:29:23,513 --> 00:29:25,557
Let's go !

257
00:29:33,481 --> 00:29:36,651
First platoon, forward, march !

258
00:29:36,735 --> 00:29:41,364
- Second platoon, forward, march !
- Everybody stay down !

259
00:29:41,448 --> 00:29:45,869
Aim ! Fire !
Aim ! Fire !

260
00:30:30,747 --> 00:30:36,336
- Bring some water ! Quick !
- A doctor ! Call a doctor !

261
00:30:44,719 --> 00:30:50,100
- Hey, you, come here !
- What do you want ?

262
00:30:50,183 --> 00:30:53,061
- What's going on ?
- They've gone !

263
00:30:53,144 --> 00:30:57,482
- They must have reached the
harbor, by now ! - Let's go ! Go !

264
00:31:27,137 --> 00:31:29,973
Jesus and Mary help us !

265
00:32:09,095 --> 00:32:11,139
What do you reckon, Father ?

266
00:32:14,392 --> 00:32:19,439
Will these glorious new times
bring better summers ?

267
00:32:19,522 --> 00:32:24,736
Well... no...

268
00:32:26,404 --> 00:32:28,448
The Government...

269
00:33:54,075 --> 00:33:57,370
Hey ! Get out of the way !
Move it !

270
00:33:57,454 --> 00:34:00,373
- Stop ! No one can pass !
- Move it !

271
00:34:00,457 --> 00:34:04,711
- Stop ! - Why ? - The streets
are closed. - We have a pass.

272
00:34:04,794 --> 00:34:07,505
No use,
the street to Bisaquino is closed !

273
00:34:07,589 --> 00:34:14,262
- Halt ! Stop the carriages !
- Stop ! - Halt !

274
00:34:14,346 --> 00:34:19,017
- I'm sorry, no one can go through.
- Stop them, they can't go through.

275
00:34:20,018 --> 00:34:22,228
Let me see the pass, please.

276
00:34:27,484 --> 00:34:31,404
- It seems our pass is not valid.
- That's not what I said.

277
00:34:31,529 --> 00:34:36,993
We were told that all the passes
are to be considered suspended.

278
00:34:37,077 --> 00:34:39,371
Do you think we're having fun ?

279
00:34:39,454 --> 00:34:41,915
If I tell you to go back,
it means you have to go back.

280
00:34:41,998 --> 00:34:44,542
Clear the way,
let the carriages go through !

281
00:34:44,668 --> 00:34:47,212
Halt ! Stop !
Where do you think you're going ?

282
00:34:47,337 --> 00:34:49,839
No way, nobody can go through !

283
00:34:49,923 --> 00:34:53,468
I am Captain Falconeri,
I fought in Palermo on your side !

284
00:34:53,551 --> 00:34:57,222
- I received an order, what should
I do ? - Mine is an order as well !

285
00:34:57,305 --> 00:35:00,767
- Clear the way !
- Yes sir, fine, we will !

286
00:35:01,059 --> 00:35:07,816
Come on, move aside, move,
clear the way.

287
00:35:10,068 --> 00:35:12,112
Careful, move, move !

288
00:35:13,947 --> 00:35:15,990
Come on !

289
00:35:23,873 --> 00:35:26,209
Come on, come on !

290
00:36:08,251 --> 00:36:11,838
Since you live amongst
the nobility, tell us:

291
00:36:11,921 --> 00:36:16,217
what do the lords say
about this war ?

292
00:36:16,301 --> 00:36:21,765
What does the Prince Salina
think, as proud as he is ?

293
00:36:23,975 --> 00:36:30,482
You see, the lords, as you call
them, are not easily understood.

294
00:36:30,565 --> 00:36:36,529
They live in their own universe,
which was not created by God,

295
00:36:36,613 --> 00:36:39,574
but by themselves,
through centuries

296
00:36:39,657 --> 00:36:44,329
of painful
and joyful experiences.

297
00:36:44,412 --> 00:36:51,503
They rejoice or suffer for things
that mean nothing to us,

298
00:36:51,586 --> 00:36:54,255
but that are vital to them.

299
00:36:56,257 --> 00:36:59,552
I don't mean to say that the lords
are bad, on the contrary.

300
00:36:59,636 --> 00:37:04,015
They are just... different.

301
00:37:04,099 --> 00:37:09,187
They don't care about things
that are very important to us,

302
00:37:09,270 --> 00:37:12,399
but they are afraid
of things we ignore.

303
00:37:12,482 --> 00:37:14,818
Take the Prince Salina,
for example.

304
00:37:14,901 --> 00:37:17,278
He couldn't possibly bear

305
00:37:17,362 --> 00:37:21,241
to loose his house in Donnafugata,
where we're now going.

306
00:37:21,324 --> 00:37:27,872
But... if you ask him what
he thinks about the revolution,

307
00:37:29,040 --> 00:37:32,043
he'll say there was
no revolution at all,

308
00:37:32,127 --> 00:37:37,173
- ..that everything will be the
same as ever. - I hope not !

309
00:37:37,257 --> 00:37:42,178
Right...
We'd better read the breviary.

310
00:37:44,264 --> 00:37:50,437
Let's see... Psalm 44.

311
00:37:50,520 --> 00:37:53,690
''Effundit cor meum
verbum bonum dico ego

312
00:37:53,773 --> 00:37:58,903
carmen meum regi, lingua mea stilus
et scribae velocis.

313
00:37:59,029 --> 00:38:03,616
Speciosus est forma prae filiis
hominum, diffusa est gratia

314
00:38:03,700 --> 00:38:09,664
super labia tua: propterea
benedixit tibi Deus in aeternum.

315
00:38:11,458 --> 00:38:14,711
Cinge gladium tuum
super fenur potentissime,

316
00:38:14,794 --> 00:38:17,464
decorum tuum et ornatum tuum.

317
00:39:19,609 --> 00:39:23,113
Come on, hurry up.
Quick !

318
00:39:28,118 --> 00:39:32,789
Lay it out well, come on ! You get
the bottles, and you the glasses !

319
00:39:37,002 --> 00:39:39,045
Let's hurry, come on !

320
00:39:43,842 --> 00:39:45,885
Quick, they're coming !

321
00:39:49,347 --> 00:39:54,936
Whatever you command,
and let's hope for the best !

322
00:39:55,020 --> 00:39:57,897
I'm so glad to see you again,
Excellency.

323
00:39:58,982 --> 00:40:01,317
- Now we'll rest a little.
- Sure.

324
00:40:01,401 --> 00:40:05,530
- You'll sit under those trees.
- We'll soon head to Donnafugata.

325
00:40:05,613 --> 00:40:08,700
- Did the soldiers pass by ?
- They sure did.

326
00:40:08,783 --> 00:40:10,618
- Did they cause any damage ?
- Yes...

327
00:40:10,702 --> 00:40:17,292
- C'est pire qu'en Algerie ! - This
certainly isn't Algeria, my dear !

328
00:40:23,006 --> 00:40:28,470
- It feels so good ! Do you want to
refresh a little ? - Yes. - Here.

329
00:40:29,471 --> 00:40:32,557
Put it on your temples
and forehead.

330
00:40:36,227 --> 00:40:38,271
It's so cool !

331
00:40:40,940 --> 00:40:43,568
It feels really good !

332
00:40:43,651 --> 00:40:46,279
- You feel better, huh ?
- Oh, yes !

333
00:40:47,072 --> 00:40:50,867
Let's join the others,
the food will soon be gone !

334
00:41:02,921 --> 00:41:04,964
May I have it back ?

335
00:41:09,219 --> 00:41:11,262
Come on, let's go.

336
00:41:13,890 --> 00:41:16,518
You're hungry, huh ?

337
00:41:36,162 --> 00:41:39,332
- Father Pirrone, this is for you.
- The meat is excellent !

338
00:41:39,416 --> 00:41:44,295
Everybody said: ''His Excellency
won't be able to leave Palermo.

339
00:41:44,379 --> 00:41:47,507
It can't be expected that
he'll travel in times like these.

340
00:41:47,590 --> 00:41:52,804
Who knows what happened
to His Excellency and his family !''

341
00:41:52,887 --> 00:41:58,727
But they're all safe.
Thank God !

342
00:41:58,810 --> 00:42:02,480
Of course we are ! What did you
expect would happen to us ?

343
00:42:02,564 --> 00:42:04,607
Everything went just fine.

344
00:42:06,568 --> 00:42:10,113
ln fact, a few days after
Garibaldi's arrival to Palermo,

345
00:42:10,196 --> 00:42:13,533
Tancredi had brought home
a nice Tuscan General

346
00:42:13,616 --> 00:42:16,703
who wished to admire
the villa's frescoes.

347
00:42:16,786 --> 00:42:20,707
He was very helpful in providing
the passes to Donnafugata.

348
00:42:22,876 --> 00:42:27,589
My family and I are very pleased
to have you here, General.

349
00:42:27,672 --> 00:42:29,716
Thank you, Excellency.

350
00:42:39,100 --> 00:42:41,478
He called you ''Excellency'' !

351
00:42:41,561 --> 00:42:44,647
It's his first infraction
to Garibaldi's orders !

352
00:42:46,483 --> 00:42:48,943
- Concetta !
- Welcome back.

353
00:42:49,069 --> 00:42:51,905
- Mademoiselle.
- Tancredi.

354
00:42:51,988 --> 00:42:54,532
Hello !
Dear aunt...

355
00:42:54,657 --> 00:42:58,787
General, my nephew told me you
wish to see the villa's frescoes.

356
00:42:58,870 --> 00:43:00,955
I'd love to, Excellency.

357
00:43:01,039 --> 00:43:04,584
It'll soon be dark,
so let's do it now.

358
00:43:04,668 --> 00:43:11,174
ln the middle, Flashing Jupiter,
Juno, Mars, Venus and Mercury.

359
00:43:11,299 --> 00:43:15,595
On that side, Thetis is preceded
by a host of tritons and dryads,

360
00:43:15,679 --> 00:43:18,556
and Apollo surrounded by clouds.

361
00:43:18,640 --> 00:43:21,726
They're all exalting the glory
of Casa Salina.

362
00:43:36,783 --> 00:43:38,827
Tancredi...

363
00:43:39,411 --> 00:43:44,624
- Do you want a mint ?
- Yes, just the ones I like !

364
00:43:44,708 --> 00:43:46,751
That's why I brought them !

365
00:44:04,477 --> 00:44:10,900
- He's so pale... Are we sure the
wound is not bad ? - Excuse me ?

366
00:44:20,410 --> 00:44:25,457
Well,
a promotion is well worth a wound !

367
00:44:26,708 --> 00:44:37,260
I found myself
in those same places,

368
00:44:37,344 --> 00:44:41,014
but what I can no longer find
are those days !

369
00:44:41,097 --> 00:44:46,227
I found myself
in those same places,

370
00:44:46,311 --> 00:44:54,527
but what I can no longer find
are those days !

371
00:44:57,072 --> 00:44:59,032
The coaches are coming !

372
00:46:16,526 --> 00:46:19,904
I'm pleased to welcome
Their Excellencies.

373
00:46:19,988 --> 00:46:23,324
- Don Onofrio, how are you ?
- Well, Excellency.

374
00:46:23,408 --> 00:46:26,995
The palace is in the exact state
you left it in.

375
00:46:27,078 --> 00:46:30,832
- Very well, Don Onofrio.
- Finally !

376
00:46:30,915 --> 00:46:36,504
Là ! Rosalie, quelle poussiêre, toi
aussi, pauvre petite, viens ici.

377
00:46:37,464 --> 00:46:39,758
Very well indeed, Don Onofrio.

378
00:46:50,643 --> 00:46:54,939
I am proud of shaking hands with
one who was wounded in Palermo !

379
00:46:55,023 --> 00:46:58,902
I was made Captain just because
I got a gnat in the eye !

380
00:47:01,363 --> 00:47:04,157
I know you did a lot for our cause,
Don Calogero !

381
00:47:04,240 --> 00:47:07,744
- Crispi spoke very nicely about
you. - Thank you very much.

382
00:47:11,539 --> 00:47:15,085
- Don Ciccio !
- Welcome back, Excellency.

383
00:47:15,168 --> 00:47:19,381
Dear Teresina, it's such a pleasure
to see you again.

384
00:47:20,423 --> 00:47:24,010
And you, of course.
So, what is new ?

385
00:47:24,094 --> 00:47:26,304
What do you mean ?

386
00:47:26,388 --> 00:47:30,725
- I don't know, Excellency...
Do you mind if... - Go ahead.

387
00:50:28,820 --> 00:50:33,950
Te Deum laudamus !

388
00:50:34,034 --> 00:50:42,334
Te Dominum confitemur.

389
00:50:42,417 --> 00:50:56,598
Te aeternum Patrem
omnis terra veneratur.

390
00:50:56,681 --> 00:51:00,226
Tibis omnes Angeli...

391
00:51:00,310 --> 00:51:04,064
- Remember the invitations
to dinner for tonight. - Yes.

392
00:51:04,147 --> 00:51:08,818
- You must invite the wives
as well. - Why ? - It's better.

393
00:51:10,570 --> 00:51:16,576
lnvite Don Calogero and his wife,
the notary and his,

394
00:51:16,659 --> 00:51:20,580
and Don Ciccio Tumeo, who,
thank God, doesn't have one.

395
00:51:20,663 --> 00:51:23,750
- And all the others after dinner.
- Yes.

396
00:51:26,211 --> 00:51:44,562
Sanctus, Sanctus,
Sanctus Dominus Deus Sabaoth.

397
00:51:44,646 --> 00:51:58,368
Pleni sunt caeli et terra
maiestatis gloriae tuae.

398
00:51:58,451 --> 00:52:11,548
Te gloriosus Apostulorum chorus,

399
00:52:11,631 --> 00:52:23,768
Te Prophetarum laudabilis numerus.

400
00:52:30,025 --> 00:52:33,111
- What ?
- It's Mimì, Excellency.

401
00:52:35,071 --> 00:52:37,282
- Father Pirrone...
- What about him ?

402
00:52:37,365 --> 00:52:40,660
He wishes to see Your Excellency
immediately.

403
00:52:42,162 --> 00:52:45,623
- Fine, then, let him in.
- Yes, Excellency.

404
00:52:50,420 --> 00:52:54,174
May I come in, Excellency ?
I'm so sorry, I didn't know...

405
00:52:54,257 --> 00:52:56,968
- Don't be silly, Father.
- Yes, Excellency.

406
00:52:57,052 --> 00:53:00,972
You are used to the nudity of the
soul, the body's is more innocent.

407
00:53:01,097 --> 00:53:04,517
- Give me my bathrobe.
- Excuse me ? - The bathrobe !

408
00:53:04,601 --> 00:53:06,644
Sure, here.

409
00:53:15,111 --> 00:53:17,155
Come on, Father !

410
00:53:23,995 --> 00:53:26,873
- Harder, Father, come on !
- Yes, Excellency.

411
00:53:29,000 --> 00:53:33,129
- Take my suggestion. - Yes ?
- Do have a bath, once in a while.

412
00:53:35,423 --> 00:53:38,051
Take a seat. Sit down !

413
00:53:41,096 --> 00:53:44,182
Tell me,
what's all this hurry for ?

414
00:53:46,768 --> 00:53:49,187
Well, Excellency...

415
00:53:49,270 --> 00:53:53,274
I am in charge
of a very delicate mission.

416
00:53:53,358 --> 00:53:56,736
A person you care very much about,
chose to open her heart to me,

417
00:53:56,820 --> 00:53:59,489
and asked me to tell you,

418
00:53:59,572 --> 00:54:03,410
maybe wrongly convinced
of your admiration for me...

419
00:54:03,535 --> 00:54:07,080
- Could you be more concise ?
- Of course, Excellency. You see...

420
00:54:07,163 --> 00:54:12,210
- Come on, Father ! Who is it ?
The Princess ? - Not at all !

421
00:54:12,335 --> 00:54:15,046
The Princess is very tired,
she's resting, now.

422
00:54:15,130 --> 00:54:17,590
I'm talking about Miss Concetta.

423
00:54:20,135 --> 00:54:22,178
She's in love.

424
00:54:23,096 --> 00:54:27,017
Miss Concetta ?
How... ?

425
00:54:27,142 --> 00:54:29,394
Ah ! Rubbish !

426
00:54:34,107 --> 00:54:38,194
I'm sorry if I've upset you,
I didn't think...

427
00:54:38,278 --> 00:54:44,576
You see, Father a man can think of
himself as still young, even at 45.

428
00:54:44,659 --> 00:54:49,039
But when he realizes his kids
are grown enough to fall in love,

429
00:54:49,122 --> 00:54:53,585
old age becomes
all of a sudden overwhelming.

430
00:54:53,668 --> 00:54:55,712
Excellency...

431
00:54:57,088 --> 00:55:03,303
You haven't even asked me who...
the boy Miss Concetta...

432
00:55:03,386 --> 00:55:05,430
No need.

433
00:55:10,810 --> 00:55:14,814
She's so silly,
why didn't she tell me herself ?

434
00:55:16,107 --> 00:55:19,861
What am I supposed to say ?

435
00:55:20,737 --> 00:55:24,616
Well, Excellency, the wish to found
a Christian family

436
00:55:24,699 --> 00:55:27,369
is very much welcomed
by the Church,

437
00:55:27,452 --> 00:55:29,371
and Christ's presence at Cana...

438
00:55:29,454 --> 00:55:31,748
Let's not lose track,
Father, please !

439
00:55:31,831 --> 00:55:34,209
I mean to talk about
this one wedding,

440
00:55:34,334 --> 00:55:39,464
not the Cana Wedding,
or wedding in general !

441
00:55:39,547 --> 00:55:43,301
Has Don Tancredi proposed already ?
When did he ?

442
00:55:43,385 --> 00:55:47,430
Well, I don't think he has made
any straight proposal, yet.

443
00:55:47,514 --> 00:55:51,059
But Miss Concetta has no doubts.

444
00:55:51,142 --> 00:55:54,604
His care, his looks, his words...

445
00:55:54,688 --> 00:55:57,816
The little Princess
is sure he loves her

446
00:55:57,899 --> 00:56:00,944
and she feels the proposal
is about to come.

447
00:56:01,027 --> 00:56:05,323
Don't worry, Father,
we're not in danger, yet.

448
00:56:05,407 --> 00:56:08,952
These are the fantasies
of a romantic, shy girl.

449
00:56:09,035 --> 00:56:15,375
- Why do you say ''danger'' ?
- Father, can you picture her...

450
00:56:15,458 --> 00:56:19,045
as ambassadress
to Vienna or St. Petersburg ?

451
00:56:19,129 --> 00:56:24,801
I love Concetta, I like her.
She's so quiet and submissive.

452
00:56:24,884 --> 00:56:28,888
- But Tancredi... Tancredi has
a great future ! - Yes, but...

453
00:56:28,972 --> 00:56:35,478
Come on, Father, how could ever
Concetta, so virtuous and shy,

454
00:56:35,562 --> 00:56:40,525
help a husband climb the slippery
stairs of the new society ?

455
00:56:40,608 --> 00:56:42,652
Tancredi needs money.

456
00:56:44,154 --> 00:56:46,865
Concetta will get a dowry,
of course.

457
00:56:46,948 --> 00:56:50,994
But the fortunes of the family will
have to be split in seven !

458
00:56:51,077 --> 00:56:53,455
Mark, I said seven.

459
00:56:53,580 --> 00:56:56,041
Tancredi needs a lot more.

460
00:56:58,752 --> 00:57:01,880
One of the Sutera girls,
for instance.

461
00:57:01,963 --> 00:57:06,009
Yeah, I know, I know.
They're so ugly, poor things !

462
00:57:06,092 --> 00:57:09,054
- But so rich, Father, very, very
rich ! - Yes, but what about...

463
00:57:09,137 --> 00:57:11,181
What ? Love ?

464
00:57:12,140 --> 00:57:17,103
Yeah, right, love ! It moves
heaven and earth for a year,

465
00:57:17,187 --> 00:57:21,107
and nothing for the remaining
thirty. I know what love is.

466
00:57:22,776 --> 00:57:28,365
- What ? - Excellency, what dress
do you wish to wear for dinner ?

467
00:57:30,617 --> 00:57:34,746
Father, you'll tell Concetta
that I'm not upset at all,

468
00:57:34,829 --> 00:57:38,333
but that we'll face the subject
when it'll be more than a fantasy.

469
00:57:38,416 --> 00:57:42,545
- What should I wear ?
Any of my tailcoats. - Very well.

470
00:57:52,013 --> 00:57:54,933
- Au revoir, Father.
- Excellency...

471
00:57:57,769 --> 00:57:59,813
Good-bye.

472
00:58:17,205 --> 00:58:22,002
Dad ! Don Calogero is coming up the
stairs. He's wearing a tailcoat !

473
00:58:23,712 --> 00:58:25,755
A tailcoat !

474
00:58:31,219 --> 00:58:35,390
Uncle, these news have affected you
more than the landing in Marsala.

475
00:58:35,473 --> 00:58:39,310
Don Calogero with a white tie
is the sign there's a revolution !

476
00:58:52,532 --> 00:58:56,453
Yes, it is a tailcoat indeed,
but... look at it !

477
00:58:57,829 --> 00:58:59,831
And the shoes !

478
00:58:59,914 --> 00:59:03,626
- Good evening, Don Calogero.
- Good evening, Prince.

479
00:59:03,710 --> 00:59:09,007
- My wife... isn't feeling well.
- I'm very sorry. - Thank you.

480
00:59:09,090 --> 00:59:12,927
I hope Their Excellencies will
allow my daughter Angelica's

481
00:59:13,011 --> 00:59:15,055
coming in her place.

482
00:59:16,264 --> 00:59:18,475
Of course ! Come, please.

483
00:59:21,436 --> 00:59:24,314
For a whole month she's done
nothing but talk about

484
00:59:24,397 --> 00:59:28,735
how much it would please her
to meet you, now that she's grown.

485
00:59:28,818 --> 00:59:32,989
I remember her very well,
as a child. She was so cute !

486
00:59:33,073 --> 00:59:35,116
We'll be glad to see her again.

487
00:59:41,164 --> 00:59:44,417
- Good evening, Don Calogero.
- Good evening, Miss.

488
00:59:47,962 --> 00:59:51,049
- Princess...
- Good evening, Don Calogero.

489
00:59:52,759 --> 00:59:57,597
My daughter will be here soon.
She wasn't quite ready, yet.

490
00:59:57,681 --> 01:00:00,558
It's such a short walk
from our place.
