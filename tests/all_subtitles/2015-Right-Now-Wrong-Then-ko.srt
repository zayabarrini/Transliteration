5
00:00:30,640 --> 00:01:13,932
I. RIGHT THEN, WRONG NOW

6
00:01:28,232 --> 00:01:30,232
It's my first time in Suwon.

7
00:01:31,132 --> 00:01:34,360
I walked to the market square,
in front of the Haenggung Palace.

8
00:01:35,460 --> 00:01:39,050
There was a coffeeshop across the street,
so I bought myself a cup of coffee.

9
00:02:24,850 --> 00:02:26,950
Wow, she's really pretty!

10
00:02:27,860 --> 00:02:30,990
That little thing...
So slender and youthful.

11
00:02:33,100 --> 00:02:35,910
I have to be careful.
She's too pretty.

12
00:02:44,440 --> 00:02:45,810
- Aren't you tired?
- No...

13
00:02:45,811 --> 00:02:47,411
- Are you all right?
- Yes, I'm okay.

14
00:02:49,980 --> 00:02:54,500
- But, is that a sledding rink over there?
- That one? Yes, it is.

15
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:59,000
- Can I smoke, too?
- Sure, go ahead.

16
00:03:03,300 --> 00:03:05,800
It's amazing that there's a
sledding rink in a place like this.

17
00:03:08,800 --> 00:03:10,400
Aren't you hungry?

18
00:03:10,500 --> 00:03:15,710
Well, I'm a bit hungry,
but I was thinking about going there.

19
00:03:15,711 --> 00:03:18,750
I can't believe there's
a sledding rink here.

20
00:03:18,850 --> 00:03:20,000
That's true.

21
00:03:23,700 --> 00:03:29,000
Director, can I be your
Assistant Director?

22
00:03:30,600 --> 00:03:34,500
Of course, I would be grateful.

23
00:03:34,500 --> 00:03:38,000
But you've been an Assistant Director
three times already.

24
00:03:38,500 --> 00:03:40,500
You're still not confident enough?

25
00:03:40,700 --> 00:03:45,000
- I'm not sure if you believe me or not, but...
- What?

26
00:03:46,500 --> 00:03:53,000
For me, you sir are the
most important film director.

27
00:03:53,200 --> 00:03:55,300
It's true, even if you don't believe me.

28
00:04:02,200 --> 00:04:06,500
I'm not the type of person who
recieves compliments very often.

29
00:04:06,800 --> 00:04:09,760
But I really appreciate it.

30
00:04:09,761 --> 00:04:15,400
Don't mention it. When I'm lonely,
you sir give me strength.

31
00:04:16,400 --> 00:04:22,950
While watching your works, I say to myself:
"Thanks to these films, my life is worth living!".

32
00:04:22,951 --> 00:04:25,201
I really think of it that way.

33
00:04:34,001 --> 00:04:37,501
The weather is quite warm today.

34
00:04:38,501 --> 00:04:43,000
- Doesn't feel like it's winter, right?
- Indeed! This weather...

35
00:04:45,401 --> 00:04:47,501
It's warm, it really is.

36
00:04:54,501 --> 00:04:57,001
- Shall we go?
- Sure.

37
00:05:15,601 --> 00:05:16,901
Sorry!

38
00:05:27,601 --> 00:05:30,701
- Are you okay?
- Yes, don't worry.

39
00:05:34,101 --> 00:05:35,101
Wanna ride?

40
00:05:40,101 --> 00:05:41,201
Is it fun?

41
00:05:54,901 --> 00:05:57,701
Maybe because I stood still,
but this time it ran smoothly.

42
00:06:12,800 --> 00:06:15,131
- How much?
- 1500 Won.

43
00:06:19,131 --> 00:06:21,231
- Have a good day.
- Thank you.

44
00:06:27,631 --> 00:06:32,731
We parted ways after eating some Kalguksu.
I told her I'm a bit tired and I need to rest.

45
00:06:33,631 --> 00:06:37,391
I promised to take her to Suwon's
Chicken Alley if I get bored tonight.

46
00:06:37,891 --> 00:06:40,300
But even if I get bored,
I don't think I'll call her.

47
00:06:42,300 --> 00:06:45,300
I have to be careful.
It's just a day.

48
00:06:46,770 --> 00:06:48,850
<i>Bok-Nae-Dang</i>

49
00:06:48,851 --> 00:06:51,901
The characters for
"Fortune" and "Inside".

50
00:06:52,401 --> 00:06:56,301
"Fortune springs from the inside"?

51
00:06:57,201 --> 00:07:00,101
Fortune arises from within...

52
00:07:02,201 --> 00:07:03,201
I'm not sure.

53
00:07:17,201 --> 00:07:18,501
- Press here.
- Got it.

54
00:07:25,401 --> 00:07:26,201
Get ready.

55
00:07:26,202 --> 00:07:27,402
One, two...

56
00:07:30,002 --> 00:07:31,002
One more.

57
00:07:33,502 --> 00:07:34,402
One, two...

58
00:08:38,201 --> 00:08:41,201
After walking up and down,
I returned to Boknaedang.

59
00:08:42,201 --> 00:08:44,301
It's the most beautiful place around here.

60
00:09:14,101 --> 00:09:16,601
This person was still here?

61
00:09:27,601 --> 00:09:29,201
Is it tasty?

62
00:09:30,901 --> 00:09:32,901
Yes, it is.

63
00:09:33,801 --> 00:09:35,401
It's Banana Milk.

64
00:09:38,001 --> 00:09:40,101
What are you doing here?

65
00:09:43,801 --> 00:09:46,001
What does it look like I'm doing?

66
00:09:47,201 --> 00:09:51,201
- You're drinking some milk.
- Yes. Great observation.

67
00:09:51,850 --> 00:09:53,601
How about you,
what are you doing?

68
00:09:54,401 --> 00:09:57,001
Well, I'm just sitting here.

69
00:09:58,301 --> 00:10:03,201
I've come to Suwon for a movie screening.
I also have to give an oral presentation.

70
00:10:05,150 --> 00:10:06,701
Are you here for a lecture?

71
00:10:07,001 --> 00:10:11,901
After the screening of my film,
I will be speaking with the audience.

72
00:10:12,301 --> 00:10:14,001
It's not really a lecture.

73
00:10:15,201 --> 00:10:18,051
- Do you have your own movies?
- Yes.

74
00:10:18,052 --> 00:10:21,402
- Are you a film director?
- Yes, that's right.

75
00:10:25,302 --> 00:10:28,002
- I see.
- What do you do?

76
00:10:32,802 --> 00:10:35,002
I'm not doing anything.

77
00:10:37,102 --> 00:10:42,000
- I'm just drinking some milk.
- I see. So you're not doing anything.

78
00:10:42,001 --> 00:10:43,202
That's right.

79
00:10:48,002 --> 00:10:53,302
So, are you a famous director?
Maybe someone I know?

80
00:10:53,902 --> 00:10:56,802
Oh, my name is Ham Chun-soo.

81
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:02,000
- Is that true?
- Yes.

82
00:11:03,800 --> 00:11:07,000
I know you very well!
You are a very famous director!

83
00:11:07,001 --> 00:11:10,001
I'm flattered.

84
00:11:10,801 --> 00:11:14,701
Now I see!
That's why you looked so familiar!

85
00:11:15,701 --> 00:11:17,701
Nice to meet you!

86
00:11:18,001 --> 00:11:21,601
- But, are you really the director Ham Chun-soo?
- Of course.

87
00:11:23,301 --> 00:11:24,701
Please, drink your milk.

88
00:11:28,801 --> 00:11:31,500
- So what is your occupation?
- Me?

89
00:11:31,501 --> 00:11:39,101
Currently, I'm a painter.
I've not been painting for too long,

90
00:11:39,102 --> 00:11:42,502
but these days I'm only
living my life while painting.

91
00:11:44,002 --> 00:11:47,502
- You even have traces of paint on your jacket!
- Yes.

92
00:11:49,802 --> 00:11:51,002
You're beautiful.

93
00:11:55,502 --> 00:11:57,002
Thanks...

94
00:11:58,702 --> 00:12:07,002
I used to have a different occupation.
But now I only live my life while painting.

95
00:12:07,302 --> 00:12:09,602
- I see.
- Yes.

96
00:12:10,600 --> 00:12:14,400
Would you like to drink
a cup of coffee with me?

97
00:12:15,200 --> 00:12:17,100
Somewhere nearby. A warm coffee.

98
00:12:17,300 --> 00:12:22,000
- Coffee?
- Yes. I think that would be great.

99
00:12:23,700 --> 00:12:27,000
- Coffee?
- To be honest...

100
00:12:27,800 --> 00:12:29,500
I think I've seen you, earlier.

101
00:12:29,501 --> 00:12:34,500
When you entered,
I've seen you briefly.

102
00:12:34,700 --> 00:12:36,000
- Really?
- Yes.

103
00:12:36,100 --> 00:12:40,400
I was so surprised to see
that you're still here!

104
00:12:41,000 --> 00:12:45,000
- Today I stayed here for quite a while.
- Yes.

105
00:12:45,600 --> 00:12:49,500
So, can I buy you a coffee?
Somewhere nearby.

106
00:12:52,300 --> 00:12:54,000
Come on, let's go!

107
00:12:55,000 --> 00:12:56,500
Okay, let's do that.

108
00:12:57,200 --> 00:13:00,500
It would be an honor, drinking
coffee with such a great director.

109
00:13:00,501 --> 00:13:02,801
Thank you!
I'm the one who's thankful.

110
00:13:02,802 --> 00:13:05,302
- Let's stand up, shall we?
- Yes.

111
00:13:06,802 --> 00:13:08,002
I'll carry this for you.

112
00:13:09,902 --> 00:13:10,802
Thank you.

113
00:13:25,702 --> 00:13:28,902
It looks tasty!
Is that Jujube Tea?

114
00:13:28,903 --> 00:13:34,803
Yes, they make it here, firsthand.
It's steaming-hot, wanna try it?

115
00:13:34,804 --> 00:13:36,004
No, thanks a lot.

116
00:13:37,404 --> 00:13:40,304
You never drink coffee?

117
00:13:40,305 --> 00:13:45,404
I can drink it, but if I do,
I get really tired. I'm a little sensitive.

118
00:13:46,004 --> 00:13:49,504
It really looks that way.
You really seem like a sensitive person.

119
00:13:49,505 --> 00:13:50,504
Really?

120
00:13:50,505 --> 00:13:53,005
- Director, you're sensitive as well.
- Me?

121
00:13:54,205 --> 00:13:57,505
Well, I'm a little sensitive, too.

122
00:13:57,506 --> 00:14:01,506
But you look much more sensitive.

123
00:14:01,806 --> 00:14:05,006
No, I think you have
more sensitivity than me.

124
00:14:05,007 --> 00:14:06,007
Really?

125
00:14:06,207 --> 00:14:09,707
That's probably why you're able
to make such great films.

126
00:14:10,007 --> 00:14:13,007
Thank you.
But have you seen my films?

127
00:14:13,707 --> 00:14:17,307
- No, not yet.
- I see.

128
00:14:18,207 --> 00:14:21,407
- I usually don't like watching movies.
- I understand.

129
00:14:21,408 --> 00:14:26,008
But I heard a lot of
people praising your works.

130
00:14:26,009 --> 00:14:28,007
It's nothing.

131
00:14:28,707 --> 00:14:31,707
You must be an excellent director.

132
00:14:31,707 --> 00:14:36,707
It's not easy for people
to offer their compliments.

133
00:14:37,008 --> 00:14:41,507
And from what I heard, it's much more
than just compliments about popularity.

134
00:14:41,807 --> 00:14:43,007
Thank you very much.

135
00:14:43,307 --> 00:14:50,007
I'm just doing the best I can,
so I appreciate every comment.

136
00:14:51,207 --> 00:14:54,007
And it's not like I'm
capable of doing much, anyway.

137
00:14:54,107 --> 00:14:56,307
- Is that so?
- However...

138
00:14:57,007 --> 00:15:01,107
I strongly hope that one day
I'll be able to create...

139
00:15:01,108 --> 00:15:05,908
...something more beautiful,
something remarkable.

140
00:15:05,909 --> 00:15:09,607
I know the feeling. I think
I'm painting for the same reason.

141
00:15:09,608 --> 00:15:11,708
Yes. I think so.

142
00:15:13,008 --> 00:15:18,408
Now I'm really curious about
what type of paintings you make.

143
00:15:20,208 --> 00:15:24,807
If you are truly interested, I'll
show you my paintings later.

144
00:15:24,808 --> 00:15:27,308
Yes, thank you!

145
00:15:37,208 --> 00:15:39,108
What are you doing today?

146
00:15:39,109 --> 00:15:45,509
Me? Nothing special today.
I arrived a day early, like an idiot.

147
00:15:46,709 --> 00:15:50,809
I'll have to drop by the atelier today.

148
00:15:50,810 --> 00:15:52,710
Really? Are you going to your atelier?

149
00:15:53,510 --> 00:15:55,010
Is there some sort of problem?

150
00:15:55,011 --> 00:16:04,011
No, it's just that I promised myself
to not let a day pass without painting.

151
00:16:05,611 --> 00:16:07,211
I understand perfectly. 

152
00:16:08,611 --> 00:16:09,811
You have to do your thing.

153
00:16:10,211 --> 00:16:18,911
It's not supremely important, but it's
a routine that I don't want to neglect.

154
00:16:18,912 --> 00:16:22,611
- I hope you understand.
- Of course I do! A routine is very important.

155
00:16:23,311 --> 00:16:28,811
If you don't stick to it, it feels
like everything is about to collapse.

156
00:16:29,300 --> 00:16:32,700
Painters, in particular, are
more likely to feel this way.

157
00:16:32,701 --> 00:16:38,401
My brother-in-law is a painter, too,
and he's pretty much the same.

158
00:16:38,402 --> 00:16:39,602
I think so.

159
00:16:39,603 --> 00:16:45,003
Doing something on a regular basis,
I think it's a great thing.

160
00:16:45,503 --> 00:16:50,703
Carrying out
while easing your mind.

161
00:16:51,603 --> 00:16:54,503
I envy that kind of lifestyle.

162
00:16:56,003 --> 00:16:57,003
If I...

163
00:16:59,804 --> 00:17:03,003
If I don't keep this promise,
I feel like I'll be completely ruined.

164
00:17:03,903 --> 00:17:05,403
That's how I feel.

165
00:17:06,703 --> 00:17:10,603
I'm scared. That's why
I have to keep this promise.

166
00:17:11,303 --> 00:17:12,103
I understand.

167
00:17:12,503 --> 00:17:16,003
Earlier, I told you that I used to
have a different occupation, right?

168
00:17:16,004 --> 00:17:16,403
Yes.

169
00:17:16,404 --> 00:17:20,004
- I used to have a modeling career.
- You used to be a model?

170
00:17:20,005 --> 00:17:20,905
Yes.

171
00:17:21,105 --> 00:17:24,904
I was earning a good amount of money...

172
00:17:25,505 --> 00:17:36,205
But then I realized it's not
how I want to live my life.

173
00:17:37,905 --> 00:17:39,205
I think I know the feeling.

174
00:17:41,105 --> 00:17:45,905
I don't know how could I
put up with that type of work.

175
00:17:48,105 --> 00:17:54,205
I had no future,
I was so anxious...

176
00:17:58,905 --> 00:18:04,705
That kind of work just didn't
feel like something worthwhile.

177
00:18:09,205 --> 00:18:11,205
I hated it. 

178
00:18:14,205 --> 00:18:16,205
I think I know what you mean.

179
00:18:17,205 --> 00:18:21,205
You were doing something
which didn't suit you at all.

180
00:18:22,755 --> 00:18:28,705
I always liked painting,
ever since I was little.

181
00:18:28,706 --> 00:18:33,105
No one encouraged me to start painting,

182
00:18:33,405 --> 00:18:39,205
But once I had white
paper and painting supplies,

183
00:18:39,206 --> 00:18:44,305
my heart would start racing,
I always felt that way.

184
00:18:44,505 --> 00:18:46,505
I know! I feel the same!

185
00:18:46,506 --> 00:18:52,906
Once I have paper and pencil,
I feel better for no apparent reason.

186
00:18:52,907 --> 00:18:54,907
- Really?
- Yes.

187
00:18:56,907 --> 00:18:58,307
I just...

188
00:19:01,507 --> 00:19:05,307
Motivelessly doing the things
that I can, in an innocent way...

189
00:19:07,307 --> 00:19:09,407
That's what I really like.

190
00:19:09,408 --> 00:19:11,307
I see.

191
00:19:11,407 --> 00:19:16,307
To be able to feel it,
as I'm living my life,

192
00:19:17,507 --> 00:19:21,707
To confirm it to myself,
every day, again and again...

193
00:19:24,007 --> 00:19:26,807
That's how I live my life now.

194
00:19:28,207 --> 00:19:31,007
- I think that's wonderful.
- Yes.

195
00:19:31,507 --> 00:19:33,107
I'm always eager for more.

196
00:19:34,807 --> 00:19:38,207
You know?
Do you know this sort of feeling?

197
00:19:38,208 --> 00:19:43,827
Yes, oh yes!
I know it all too well!

198
00:19:54,227 --> 00:19:58,327
She invited me to see her paintings,
so we went together to her atelier.

199
00:20:44,827 --> 00:20:47,127
- What should we do?
- What?

200
00:20:47,727 --> 00:20:49,327
I run out of coffee.

201
00:20:49,528 --> 00:20:53,327
I don't drink much coffee,
so I forgot to buy.

202
00:20:53,728 --> 00:20:55,227
It doesn't matter,
please don't worry.

203
00:20:55,228 --> 00:20:59,928
Really? Should I go and buy some?
There's a supermarket nearby, I can go.

204
00:20:59,929 --> 00:21:03,329
No, don't worry, just offer me
something that you have in here.

205
00:21:03,330 --> 00:21:05,330
- Really?
- Yes.

206
00:21:07,950 --> 00:21:10,730
It's right across the street,
I would come back in a minute.

207
00:21:11,331 --> 00:21:13,531
No, I'm perfectly fine without it.

208
00:21:13,991 --> 00:21:15,931
- Really?
- Yes.

209
00:21:18,531 --> 00:21:21,431
I would come back right away...

210
00:21:22,731 --> 00:21:24,931
- Do you need anything?
- No, I'm fine!

211
00:21:24,932 --> 00:21:27,900
Should we buy some snacks, at least?

212
00:21:27,901 --> 00:21:33,033
No, please don't. Just offer me anything
you have. Everything is fine with me.

213
00:21:35,533 --> 00:21:36,633
In that case...

214
00:21:39,733 --> 00:21:42,000
I will offer you some of
the tea that I usually drink.

215
00:21:42,001 --> 00:21:43,950
Solomon's Seal tea,
do you like it?

216
00:21:43,951 --> 00:21:45,534
Solomon's Seal tea, that's great!

217
00:21:46,000 --> 00:21:49,434
It's an organic product,
so it's good for your health.

218
00:21:49,435 --> 00:21:50,834
Oh, great!

219
00:23:27,434 --> 00:23:29,734
For a brief moment,
in a far distance...

220
00:23:31,300 --> 00:23:34,834
I feel as if I'm traveling to
a very distant place, right now.

221
00:23:42,700 --> 00:23:45,400
Director, what are you thinking about?

222
00:23:45,401 --> 00:23:47,001
Oh, me?

223
00:23:47,002 --> 00:23:53,101
I was thinking about you.
About the painting, as well.

224
00:23:53,501 --> 00:23:57,001
I still have a long way to go,
a lot of progress is still needed.

225
00:23:57,001 --> 00:23:58,501
But even so, I like it.

226
00:23:58,801 --> 00:24:00,301
I really like it.

227
00:24:00,401 --> 00:24:03,501
I think I know what are you
trying to do with it.

228
00:24:03,801 --> 00:24:07,501
You took a very difficult path.

229
00:24:08,501 --> 00:24:11,501
You certainly have what it takes
to walk on this path.

230
00:24:11,502 --> 00:24:12,701
This path...

231
00:24:14,001 --> 00:24:17,401
There's so much to explore, here.

232
00:24:18,601 --> 00:24:22,001
Stimulating your senses
in such an innocent way...

233
00:24:22,502 --> 00:24:25,502
Reaching out to your mind and heart
by making use of your senses and perception...

234
00:24:25,503 --> 00:24:28,003
This is the path you took.

235
00:24:28,903 --> 00:24:33,003
A lot of sensitivity and courage is needed,
in order to walk on this path until the end.

236
00:24:33,603 --> 00:24:36,503
That's what it feels like you're doing.

237
00:24:36,903 --> 00:24:38,903
Only by looking at it...

238
00:24:40,403 --> 00:24:42,003
...it makes sense.

239
00:24:46,503 --> 00:24:50,503
- Wow, there's a sushi restaurant here.
- Yes, it is.

240
00:24:51,103 --> 00:24:52,303
Shall we go in?

241
00:24:59,003 --> 00:25:01,003
It looks great inside.

242
00:25:01,603 --> 00:25:04,903
- Do you feel like eating sushi?
- Shall we?

243
00:25:05,653 --> 00:25:06,903
It's not expensive, either.

244
00:25:07,860 --> 00:25:10,500
It'd be great if we treat ourselves
with some sliced raw fish and soju.

245
00:25:12,800 --> 00:25:13,600
What do you think?

246
00:25:13,700 --> 00:25:15,700
Miss Hee-jung,
do you like raw fish?

247
00:25:16,100 --> 00:25:19,200
It's fine with me.
Let us enter.

248
00:25:19,700 --> 00:25:23,400
Shall we? Okay then.
Great!

249
00:25:41,600 --> 00:25:44,900
- Should I pour you some more?
- Yes, please.

250
00:25:46,700 --> 00:25:47,800
Just a little.

251
00:25:49,000 --> 00:25:50,100
Miss Hee-jung!

252
00:25:50,601 --> 00:25:54,000
You must drink too,
why aren't you drinking?

253
00:25:54,001 --> 00:25:57,001
Okay, you go ahead and drink, I'll
drink too. Please pour me a glass.

254
00:25:59,601 --> 00:26:02,001
- Thank you.
- Yes.

255
00:26:04,201 --> 00:26:06,601
- Let's drink!
- Let's drink.

256
00:26:06,602 --> 00:26:08,001
- Cheers!
- Cheers!

257
00:26:20,501 --> 00:26:25,201
Your drinking skills are no joke.
You drink really fast!

258
00:26:25,202 --> 00:26:27,902
It's the first time when I see
someone drinking like this.

259
00:26:29,202 --> 00:26:33,002
- You must be a real man!
- Stop teasing me. 

260
00:26:34,502 --> 00:26:39,002
It's the first time for me, too.

261
00:26:40,602 --> 00:26:42,502
With such a beautiful lady...

262
00:26:44,802 --> 00:26:46,002
It's the first time.

263
00:26:49,002 --> 00:26:49,802
Really?

264
00:26:49,803 --> 00:26:52,203
That's fine.
I'm glad, then.

265
00:26:53,003 --> 00:26:54,303
Seriously?

266
00:26:54,704 --> 00:26:59,104
Sure, when a man looks at a woman in
such a way, it's great. Why wouldn't it be?

267
00:27:00,104 --> 00:27:02,804
But how much do you
see me as a woman?

268
00:27:03,900 --> 00:27:05,004
I'm curious.

269
00:27:06,804 --> 00:27:07,804
How much?!

270
00:27:10,304 --> 00:27:13,904
Stop joking around,
how can I put that into words?

271
00:27:16,804 --> 00:27:21,004
How can I even express it in words?!

272
00:27:27,604 --> 00:27:32,104
The alcohol is delicious today.

273
00:27:32,105 --> 00:27:34,005
Please talk some more.

274
00:27:35,405 --> 00:27:37,305
About what?

275
00:27:38,405 --> 00:27:40,305
If you don't talk about movies...

276
00:27:43,605 --> 00:27:45,805
At this rate,
you'll get drunk.

277
00:27:48,905 --> 00:27:52,305
Please don't worry,
I never get drunk.

278
00:27:52,306 --> 00:27:56,006
I never got drunk in my entire life.
Look.

279
00:28:02,406 --> 00:28:04,306
It's no fun once you get drunk.

280
00:28:07,106 --> 00:28:09,906
You had enough of
alcohol for today?

281
00:28:09,907 --> 00:28:14,506
We must drink everything
till the last drop.

282
00:28:14,507 --> 00:28:17,006
Please, keep drinking.

283
00:28:19,306 --> 00:28:23,006
Come on!
Drink.

284
00:28:23,606 --> 00:28:27,006
- Okay, I will.
- Great, drink.

285
00:28:37,106 --> 00:28:38,106
Miss Hee-jung...

286
00:28:46,006 --> 00:28:50,206
Thank you very much,
for staying with me.

287
00:28:52,606 --> 00:28:56,006
I truly appreciate it.

288
00:28:58,306 --> 00:29:01,706
You are...
You are so beautiful.

289
00:29:05,806 --> 00:29:07,006
I'm...

290
00:29:09,206 --> 00:29:11,506
I'm dazzled by your beauty.

291
00:29:14,106 --> 00:29:16,706
Thank you so much!

292
00:29:20,706 --> 00:29:27,006
Yes, I like it, too.
I like being with you here.

293
00:29:27,007 --> 00:29:28,007
Really?

294
00:29:30,607 --> 00:29:35,007
If you're happy,
then I'm happy, too.

295
00:29:43,307 --> 00:29:46,507
Shall we...
Shall we toast?

296
00:29:47,007 --> 00:29:50,007
- Cheers!
- Cheers!

297
00:29:51,207 --> 00:29:51,607
Down the hatch!

298
00:30:03,607 --> 00:30:05,507
- Did you drink it all?
- Yes, I did.

299
00:30:06,807 --> 00:30:08,900
- Good job!
- Really?

300
00:30:08,901 --> 00:30:09,808
Yes.

301
00:30:10,608 --> 00:30:13,208
Really good job!
Proud of my friend!

302
00:30:13,500 --> 00:30:17,000
My very very...
very very very very...

303
00:30:17,001 --> 00:30:20,102
- ...beautiful friend!
- I like being your friend.

304
00:30:20,103 --> 00:30:22,002
- That's not it...
- What?

305
00:30:22,502 --> 00:30:24,602
You're much better
than just a friend!

306
00:30:28,302 --> 00:30:29,502
Are you okay with that?

307
00:30:30,702 --> 00:30:31,602
Sure.

308
00:30:31,603 --> 00:30:32,503
What?

309
00:30:33,504 --> 00:30:34,804
It doesn't matter.

310
00:30:40,104 --> 00:30:43,004
Of course it does!
Miss Hee-jung...

311
00:30:43,604 --> 00:30:46,805
If only...

312
00:30:46,806 --> 00:30:50,005
- What should I do?
- About what?

313
00:30:50,006 --> 00:30:52,005
If only...

314
00:30:52,006 --> 00:30:55,800
If only I had a ring in my pocket...

315
00:30:55,801 --> 00:31:01,005
- Why would you have a ring in your pocket?
- I don't, but...

316
00:31:01,305 --> 00:31:05,905
I just want to express
my feelings without any constraints.

317
00:31:06,105 --> 00:31:08,005
It's because I feel
too uncomfortable right now.

318
00:31:11,805 --> 00:31:15,005
I'm suffocating on the inside,
I really am!

319
00:31:16,405 --> 00:31:18,205
I really...

320
00:31:21,050 --> 00:31:24,005
Can you explain to me
why are you so beautiful?

321
00:31:27,005 --> 00:31:28,805
I feel anxious, too.

322
00:31:30,005 --> 00:31:32,605
- You do?
- Yes, it's distressing.

323
00:31:33,805 --> 00:31:35,205
- You feel distressed?
- Yes.

324
00:31:35,506 --> 00:31:39,606
To tell you the truth,
I have no friends.

325
00:31:40,206 --> 00:31:42,606
Not even one.

326
00:31:43,506 --> 00:31:44,906
You don't have friends?

327
00:31:46,006 --> 00:31:49,506
I have men that I meet,
I have people that I like...

328
00:31:52,806 --> 00:31:56,806
I do meet with some people occasionally,
but none of them are friends.

329
00:31:59,706 --> 00:32:01,706
Director...

330
00:32:05,406 --> 00:32:07,206
Do you have friends?

331
00:32:08,866 --> 00:32:10,606
You do, don't you?

332
00:32:14,206 --> 00:32:15,206
Oh, me?

333
00:32:19,050 --> 00:32:24,506
I'm sorry, my bad.
Of course you have.

334
00:32:25,706 --> 00:32:30,306
So why do you think I don't have any?

335
00:32:36,606 --> 00:32:37,706
Director...

336
00:32:38,407 --> 00:32:39,007
Why...

337
00:32:41,907 --> 00:32:46,507
Why can't I make any friends?

338
00:33:09,407 --> 00:33:15,007
Don't give me that look,
you're only making me feel embarrassed.

339
00:33:18,907 --> 00:33:23,607
No need to stare at me with that look.
We just have an honest conversation,

340
00:33:23,608 --> 00:33:29,608
...so don't do that,
I don't need that right now.

341
00:33:30,008 --> 00:33:33,608
- Don't look at me like that!
- Okay.

342
00:33:35,008 --> 00:33:36,008
Sure.

343
00:33:40,508 --> 00:33:43,008
- I will...
- I'm...

344
00:33:47,008 --> 00:33:48,008
Miss Hee-jung...

345
00:33:48,608 --> 00:33:53,008
I'll go out for a smoke.
Wanna join me?

346
00:34:10,208 --> 00:34:12,008
Yes. Yes...

347
00:34:25,708 --> 00:34:27,008
What are you doing?

348
00:34:28,508 --> 00:34:31,208
Why did you come out?
It's cold.

349
00:34:32,708 --> 00:34:37,108
I have to go somewhere,
I totally forgot, I'm sorry.

350
00:34:37,109 --> 00:34:38,508
What?

351
00:34:40,108 --> 00:34:41,808
You're going somewhere?

352
00:34:41,809 --> 00:34:46,709
Yes, I have to meet a friend,
I totally forgot.

353
00:34:46,710 --> 00:34:50,009
It's a place where you can go, too.
Do you want to come?

354
00:34:53,909 --> 00:34:59,059
Where are we going?
It's her birthday, or something?

355
00:34:59,060 --> 00:35:01,950
No, it's not a birthday party,
just a normal party.

356
00:35:01,951 --> 00:35:06,511
She runs a café and we decided to meet this
evening, the two of us and a few other people.

357
00:35:07,011 --> 00:35:11,111
I really have to be there.
What should we do?

358
00:35:14,811 --> 00:35:18,812
- That's a good question.
- Do you want to come with me?

359
00:35:25,012 --> 00:35:28,112
Will you come with me or not?

360
00:35:28,313 --> 00:35:33,513
- No, no...
- Don't worry, she's a really good person.

361
00:35:33,514 --> 00:35:37,514
I'm sure you'll like her.
It's no problem if you join us.

362
00:35:44,014 --> 00:35:48,414
So what's your final answer?
Will you come with me, or not?

363
00:35:50,014 --> 00:35:53,214
Okay, fine. Let's go together.

364
00:35:54,314 --> 00:35:57,714
- After I finish smoking.
- In the meantime, I'll pay the bill.

365
00:35:57,715 --> 00:36:00,515
- No need to, let me do it!
- It's okay.

366
00:36:17,215 --> 00:36:22,015
Up until that point,
everything went smoothly...

367
00:36:25,015 --> 00:36:28,015
- This is the place.
- Great.

368
00:36:30,015 --> 00:36:35,015
How is it called?
"Poet and Peasant"? Oh...

369
00:36:48,215 --> 00:36:50,515
- Director.
- Yes.

370
00:36:50,516 --> 00:36:53,916
When's the special lecture?
I want to go if I have time.

371
00:36:54,616 --> 00:36:57,116
It's really not a big deal...

372
00:36:59,516 --> 00:37:06,916
The movie screening is at one o'clock.
At three o'clock I'll deliver the presentation.

373
00:37:08,216 --> 00:37:09,416
Something like that.

374
00:37:09,417 --> 00:37:14,116
I never heard you speaking in person,
so I really want to come.

375
00:37:14,117 --> 00:37:20,017
I won't have much to say,
I'm not too good with words.

376
00:37:20,018 --> 00:37:25,518
He actually speaks really well, earlier at
the atelier his words were really nice.

377
00:37:25,618 --> 00:37:28,518
- What words?
- Never mind.

378
00:37:29,218 --> 00:37:33,118
- He talked about my painting.
- Come on now...

379
00:37:33,918 --> 00:37:38,818
I never heard those words before,
today was the first time.

380
00:37:38,919 --> 00:37:40,720
- She's just exaggerating.
- You got me curious now!

381
00:37:40,721 --> 00:37:43,621
Please tell us what did you say to her.

382
00:37:46,021 --> 00:37:49,821
I just told her what I felt
while looking at her painting.

383
00:37:51,321 --> 00:37:56,821
Miss Hee-jung took this path
without knowing where she’s headed,

384
00:37:57,721 --> 00:38:05,899
but precisely because of that,
she’s bound to discover more and more.

385
00:38:05,900 --> 00:38:14,022
However, if you're not meant for this,
it's a very difficult path to follow.

386
00:38:14,023 --> 00:38:19,723
A lot of sensitivity
and courage is needed...

387
00:38:19,724 --> 00:38:24,023
...in order to walk on
this path until the end.

388
00:38:24,024 --> 00:38:26,923
Are you walking
on this path, Hee-jung?

389
00:38:28,524 --> 00:38:32,924
That's one way of seeing things.

390
00:38:32,925 --> 00:38:36,124
Those words really gave me
a lot of strength.

391
00:38:36,724 --> 00:38:38,024
Excuse me, but...

392
00:38:38,025 --> 00:38:44,125
When you speak about your films,
you seem to give the same description?!

393
00:38:44,125 --> 00:38:45,425
- Me?
- Yes.

394
00:38:45,725 --> 00:38:52,725
The same description that you gave just now,
appears in one of your interviews that I read.

395
00:38:52,726 --> 00:38:54,026
- Are you sure?
- Yes!

396
00:38:54,726 --> 00:38:56,425
Is that right, Director?

397
00:38:56,426 --> 00:38:57,826
Did I?

398
00:38:58,426 --> 00:39:03,976
I'm not saying that just for the sake of it,
but it appears you always speak that way.

399
00:39:05,226 --> 00:39:13,626
Director, an acquaintance of mine told me
that you're quite skilled with women.

400
00:39:13,627 --> 00:39:17,326
Is it true that you're a womanizer?

401
00:39:18,326 --> 00:39:21,326
- Did you really hear such thing?
- Yes.

402
00:39:22,726 --> 00:39:26,526
Apparently, you were involved
with an actress in one occasion...

403
00:39:27,026 --> 00:39:36,726
And word has it, you also had a serious
relationship with a member from your film crew.

404
00:39:36,727 --> 00:39:41,126
- My memory never lets me down.
- I see.

405
00:39:41,127 --> 00:39:45,127
It's not a big deal,
you just hear things.

406
00:39:45,128 --> 00:39:48,128
The things that you hear
are no more than just that.

407
00:39:49,528 --> 00:39:52,128
There is nothing to
comment on that subject.

408
00:39:53,728 --> 00:39:56,228
It's just rumors.
Just rumors, most likely.

409
00:39:56,229 --> 00:39:58,329
Besides, men and women are
supposed to like each other.

410
00:39:58,330 --> 00:40:02,850
If they don't like each other,
who else will like them?

411
00:40:02,851 --> 00:40:05,950
Professor, I agree with you.

412
00:40:07,631 --> 00:40:12,731
- But... Aren't you married?
- What? Who, me?

413
00:40:12,732 --> 00:40:14,432
Yes you, Director.

414
00:40:15,232 --> 00:40:16,532
Oh well...

415
00:40:17,032 --> 00:40:20,632
Of course I'm married!

416
00:40:20,633 --> 00:40:26,232
Really? I see. The things that
I heard turned out to be true.

417
00:40:28,632 --> 00:40:33,732
But I'm amazed by how many
things you heard about me.

418
00:40:34,832 --> 00:40:37,432
I have a wide circle of acquaintances.

419
00:40:37,632 --> 00:40:40,432
It's also because you're quite famous.

420
00:40:40,633 --> 00:40:42,433
So I get to hear things.

421
00:40:43,933 --> 00:40:47,333
But, you got married
a long time ago, right?

422
00:40:48,733 --> 00:40:56,233
Yes, it's been a while.
I got married at the age of 23.

423
00:40:56,234 --> 00:40:58,533
I was very young.

424
00:40:58,534 --> 00:41:03,534
- Wow, so early.
- Director, why did you get married so early?

425
00:41:03,834 --> 00:41:08,034
Oh, that? Jeez...

426
00:41:08,035 --> 00:41:10,334
I can't believe
we're talking about this.

427
00:41:12,134 --> 00:41:18,334
Back then,
my condition was not good.

428
00:41:19,584 --> 00:41:23,334
I was ruined on the inside.
That's when...

429
00:41:25,834 --> 00:41:31,434
That's when I met her. She was the
exact opposite of how I used to be.

430
00:41:31,435 --> 00:41:34,735
She was truly a good person.

431
00:41:39,735 --> 00:41:45,335
So I decided to live my life with her,
in order to become a decent human being.

432
00:41:45,336 --> 00:41:46,435
I see.

433
00:41:46,436 --> 00:41:50,035
It's a good thing to
get married early.

434
00:41:50,036 --> 00:41:52,036
When their heads are not
crammed with many thoughts,

435
00:41:52,037 --> 00:41:54,036
...two people trying to
accomplish something together.

436
00:41:54,037 --> 00:41:56,537
Isn't that why we get married, after all?

437
00:41:56,538 --> 00:41:59,538
- You got married early too, right?
- Yes, pretty early.

438
00:41:59,539 --> 00:42:04,100
Soo-young, I have to rest,
I've been drinking too much.

439
00:42:04,101 --> 00:42:05,890
Sure. You want me to
bring you something warm?

440
00:42:05,891 --> 00:42:08,541
It's okay. I'll come back
after I rest for a while.

441
00:42:08,542 --> 00:42:10,341
- Excuse me.
- Yes.

442
00:42:11,941 --> 00:42:14,241
She always takes a nap after drinking.

443
00:42:14,242 --> 00:42:15,140
Oh, really?

444
00:42:15,141 --> 00:42:16,441
But she sobers up really quick!

445
00:42:16,442 --> 00:42:19,542
After a quick rest,
she'll be as fresh as a daisy.

446
00:42:20,342 --> 00:42:22,742
She looks even better
when she's drunk.

447
00:42:23,342 --> 00:42:24,200
She's very pretty.

448
00:42:24,201 --> 00:42:25,990
- She is.
- Right?

449
00:42:28,800 --> 00:42:30,600
Right...

450
00:42:30,601 --> 00:42:32,101
- Please drink some more.
- What?

451
00:42:32,102 --> 00:42:33,502
- Shall we toast?
- Yes.

452
00:42:33,503 --> 00:42:36,003
- I'm a big fan, Director.
- Let's toast.

453
00:42:36,804 --> 00:42:38,004
- Cheers!
- Cheers!

454
00:42:38,005 --> 00:42:39,105
Thank you.

455
00:42:42,805 --> 00:42:45,505
I drank too much,
it's not okay.

456
00:42:46,650 --> 00:42:49,905
Your alcohol tolerance is pretty high.

457
00:42:52,305 --> 00:42:54,605
I never got drunk once in my life.

458
00:42:55,305 --> 00:42:58,906
- And yet, he's drunk.
- That's not true. I'm not drunk.

459
00:42:58,907 --> 00:43:00,407
- Please don't worry.
- OK.

460
00:43:25,907 --> 00:43:27,007
Are you sleeping?

461
00:43:31,207 --> 00:43:32,207
No.

462
00:43:34,607 --> 00:43:37,007
What's wrong?
Are you tired?

463
00:43:37,930 --> 00:43:39,007
Just go.

464
00:43:41,807 --> 00:43:43,207
You shouldn't have come.

465
00:43:46,207 --> 00:43:47,707
- Should I go?
- Yes.

466
00:43:50,807 --> 00:43:52,307
You want me to go?

467
00:43:55,307 --> 00:43:56,307
You do?

468
00:43:56,950 --> 00:43:59,507
Director, why are you
doing this to me?

469
00:44:00,057 --> 00:44:00,707
Tell me.

470
00:44:06,407 --> 00:44:09,007
Is it because of
what I said earlier?

471
00:44:13,157 --> 00:44:13,907
Is it?

472
00:44:48,907 --> 00:44:50,307
I'm sorry.

473
00:44:55,707 --> 00:44:57,007
I'll leave.

474
00:45:54,307 --> 00:45:55,507
Why did you come out?

475
00:45:56,107 --> 00:45:59,107
Soo-young called me,
she said you left her place.

476
00:46:03,907 --> 00:46:05,507
Who did you meet today?

477
00:46:06,407 --> 00:46:08,207
Various people.

478
00:46:08,208 --> 00:46:10,008
I met Soo-young...

479
00:46:10,508 --> 00:46:12,708
And some others.

480
00:46:14,508 --> 00:46:16,308
I heard you met a movie director.

481
00:46:16,309 --> 00:46:17,808
Who's that director?

482
00:46:18,908 --> 00:46:23,207
You don't know him, mom, he's an
arthouse film director...You don't know him.

483
00:46:23,208 --> 00:46:24,008
Really?

484
00:46:24,308 --> 00:46:27,008
But why did you drink so much, again?

485
00:46:27,309 --> 00:46:30,009
Are you crazy? You're
getting drunk on a daily basis!

486
00:46:30,509 --> 00:46:35,009
- Let's go inside, and get some sleep.
- Stop drinking so much.

487
00:47:19,320 --> 00:47:26,240
<i>Suwon Hwaseong Museum</i>

488
00:47:26,241 --> 00:47:31,509
<i>(use the side door
during the event)</i>

489
00:47:31,509 --> 00:47:36,109
The weather is very cold, so we'd like
to thank everyone who gathered here today.

490
00:47:37,309 --> 00:47:42,809
Everyone will work even harder for the
next year's edition of this film festival.

491
00:47:42,810 --> 00:47:44,908
That's our a solemn promise.

492
00:47:44,909 --> 00:47:52,009
Before wrapping up, I'd like to ask the
director the last and most important question.

493
00:47:53,610 --> 00:47:57,900
Director, I will ask you
a short question,

494
00:47:57,901 --> 00:48:02,410
and I expect your answer
to be equally short.

495
00:48:02,411 --> 00:48:06,711
Director, what is film to you?

496
00:48:06,712 --> 00:48:12,912
From all the experiences that you gathered
as a director, your affection for film...

497
00:48:12,913 --> 00:48:17,011
What is it that defines film for you?

498
00:48:17,012 --> 00:48:19,512
If you can answer in short,
it would be greatly appreciated.

499
00:48:19,513 --> 00:48:21,013
- In short?
- Yes.

500
00:48:23,513 --> 00:48:27,013
I started without knowing anything.

501
00:48:28,213 --> 00:48:33,813
By doing so, I started to 
discover other types of things...

502
00:48:39,913 --> 00:48:45,713
A lot of sounds are
running through my head right now,

503
00:48:49,013 --> 00:48:53,713
And if I utter those sounds,
they become words.

504
00:48:53,714 --> 00:48:54,514
But...

505
00:48:55,814 --> 00:49:00,213
At the end of the day,
words will remain just words.

506
00:49:00,214 --> 00:49:07,214
The films, myself,
my experiences, your lives...

507
00:49:09,714 --> 00:49:13,214
All of these things have
nothing to do with words!

508
00:49:16,314 --> 00:49:17,514
The power of words?

509
00:49:21,014 --> 00:49:23,114
What a joke.

510
00:49:23,115 --> 00:49:29,214
Why do people keep searching for those
words as if they were something special?

511
00:49:31,514 --> 00:49:32,714
For me...

512
00:49:34,614 --> 00:49:39,714
There's no such thing as
important words.

513
00:49:39,715 --> 00:49:40,815
On the contrary!

514
00:49:43,615 --> 00:49:45,515
They're just a hindrance.

515
00:49:51,515 --> 00:49:55,015
If you would have just asked casually,
it would've been much better.

516
00:49:57,715 --> 00:50:00,014
- It's difficult.
- Is it?

517
00:50:00,015 --> 00:50:02,415
What was your name, again?

518
00:50:02,416 --> 00:50:05,216
Yes.
Oh, yes...

519
00:50:05,217 --> 00:50:07,717
I'm Seong-guk. Oh...
Ahn Seong...Guk?!

520
00:50:07,718 --> 00:50:11,418
Mr. Ahn Seong Guk.
I'll get up first.

521
00:50:12,418 --> 00:50:16,818
Thank you all for coming to watch
my film. Be careful on your way home.

522
00:50:19,918 --> 00:50:21,018
Thank you.

523
00:50:21,719 --> 00:50:25,019
Looks like the director is leaving...

524
00:50:28,319 --> 00:50:31,619
Director Ham Chun-soo is leaving now.

525
00:50:46,910 --> 00:50:48,019
Director.

526
00:50:49,019 --> 00:50:51,719
- Hello.
- You came?

527
00:50:51,720 --> 00:50:56,820
- I didn't see you inside.
- I came in late, I'm sorry.

528
00:50:57,020 --> 00:51:00,620
I drank too much, so I couldn't
wake up on time. I'm very sorry.

529
00:51:00,621 --> 00:51:04,521
Don't worry, I haven't sobered up
yet, either. I'm just like yesterday.

530
00:51:05,021 --> 00:51:10,021
I shouldn't have drank so much.
Today was a mess.

531
00:51:11,221 --> 00:51:13,021
Why did it turn out so badly?

532
00:51:13,521 --> 00:51:19,721
Oh, the host of the event... He's so
shameless, he only cares about himself.

533
00:51:20,621 --> 00:51:25,221
He's so ignorant.
So embarrassing.

534
00:51:25,621 --> 00:51:28,321
How could someone like him
even become a film critic?

535
00:51:29,700 --> 00:51:31,421
So embarrassing.

536
00:51:31,422 --> 00:51:35,322
- Did you hear everything?
- No, I came in very late.

537
00:51:35,323 --> 00:51:36,822
Oh, I see.

538
00:51:37,322 --> 00:51:38,722
I...

539
00:51:42,223 --> 00:51:45,422
I hope you'll read
this book when you have time.

540
00:51:46,023 --> 00:51:47,023
Thank you!

541
00:51:47,723 --> 00:51:49,823
- You are the author?
- Yes.

542
00:51:57,423 --> 00:52:00,523
<i>Discovering the hidden things 
laying at the surface of our lives,</i>

543
00:52:01,023 --> 00:52:04,123
<i>Walking on that path
as a method to overcome our fears...</i>

544
00:52:04,124 --> 00:52:05,524
<i>I concur with that thought.</i>

545
00:52:08,524 --> 00:52:11,024
Thank you very much!
I can't wait to read it.

546
00:52:11,025 --> 00:52:12,025
Yes.

547
00:52:12,525 --> 00:52:15,525
Well then, I'll take my leave now.

548
00:52:15,625 --> 00:52:17,625
- Goodbye.
- You're going?

549
00:52:17,626 --> 00:52:20,025
- Yes. Goodbye.
- Goodbye.

550
00:52:24,525 --> 00:52:26,825
Thank you for the book!

551
00:52:31,025 --> 00:52:34,525
Director!
Team leader Ahn is looking for you.

552
00:52:34,526 --> 00:52:38,326
- Really?
- Yes, he's been asking about you, here and there.

553
00:52:38,327 --> 00:52:42,827
- Will you go back inside, now?
- I'll smoke a cigarette, first.

554
00:52:42,927 --> 00:52:47,827
Yesterday I should have called you.
I'm sorry, I was too tired.

555
00:52:48,227 --> 00:52:50,227
It's okay. Did you rest well?

556
00:52:50,228 --> 00:52:51,028
Yes...

557
00:52:51,029 --> 00:52:53,228
- Can I smoke, too?
- Sure, go ahead.

558
00:53:07,528 --> 00:53:09,228
Must have been difficult for you, earlier.

559
00:53:09,928 --> 00:53:14,000
Yes, a little. Me and that
fellow are like oil and water.

560
00:53:14,228 --> 00:53:17,028
How can a person be so shameless?

561
00:53:20,228 --> 00:53:24,028
He is so shameless,
so ignorant...

562
00:53:25,228 --> 00:53:27,828
How could someone like him
even become a film critic?

563
00:53:27,829 --> 00:53:31,729
So shameless, so ignorant...
A lump of a snob!

564
00:53:32,329 --> 00:53:35,029
And I bet he still
thinks highly of himself.

565
00:53:36,000 --> 00:53:36,929
Ridiculous.

566
00:53:37,529 --> 00:53:40,529
You two don't seem to
harmonize well with each other.

567
00:53:42,429 --> 00:53:45,329
Does that mean you're not going back in?

568
00:53:50,029 --> 00:53:52,029
Yeah, I'll just leave.

569
00:53:53,929 --> 00:53:56,329
Miss Bora, you're a good person.

570
00:53:56,929 --> 00:53:58,329
Too bad we didn't get to speak much.

571
00:53:59,000 --> 00:54:05,329
I'd really like to talk to you some more,
can we meet again once we're back in Seoul?

572
00:54:05,929 --> 00:54:08,529
Sure, let's do that.

573
00:54:10,329 --> 00:54:17,029
Every day and every moment,
try to discover new things!

574
00:54:17,230 --> 00:54:24,629
Thanks to all the things in this world,
I believe you can overcome everything...

575
00:54:26,029 --> 00:54:27,429
...including your fears.

576
00:54:28,629 --> 00:54:30,829
- Director...
- Yes?

577
00:54:39,029 --> 00:54:43,429
- Okay. Take care.
- Yes.

578
00:54:44,229 --> 00:54:46,029
Director, you're really cool.

579
00:54:47,229 --> 00:54:49,529
Really?
Thanks.

580
00:54:50,629 --> 00:54:54,029
I'm really going now.
Take care.

581
00:54:54,829 --> 00:54:57,029
- Have a safe trip back to Seoul.
- Yes, I will.

582
00:55:04,429 --> 00:55:07,729
- Goodbye!
- See ya.

583
00:55:30,829 --> 00:56:15,959
II. RIGHT NOW, WRONG THEN

584
00:58:04,200 --> 00:58:06,000
- How much?
- 1500 Won.

585
00:58:56,500 --> 00:58:59,500
- Wow, it's great in here.
- Shall we take a picture?

586
00:59:09,000 --> 00:59:10,500
A bit more to your right.

587
00:59:12,900 --> 00:59:15,000
One, two, three...

588
01:01:09,000 --> 01:01:10,100
Is it tasty?

589
01:01:12,800 --> 01:01:15,300
Yes, it is.
It's Banana Milk.

590
01:01:19,000 --> 01:01:20,200
What are you doing here?

591
01:01:22,700 --> 01:01:24,400
What does it look like I'm doing?

592
01:01:27,100 --> 01:01:30,400
You're drinking some milk.

593
01:01:32,700 --> 01:01:33,700
Great observation.

594
01:01:35,800 --> 01:01:37,300
How about you,
what are you doing?

595
01:01:38,400 --> 01:01:40,500
Well, I'm just sitting here.

596
01:01:42,600 --> 01:01:47,800
I've come to Suwon for a movie screening.
I also have to give an oral presentation.

597
01:01:49,400 --> 01:01:50,800
Will you deliver a lecture?

598
01:01:53,400 --> 01:01:56,500
After the screening of my film,
I will be speaking with the audience.

599
01:01:56,501 --> 01:02:00,001
It's not really a lecture.
I don't have much to say, anyway.

600
01:02:01,301 --> 01:02:07,301
- Are you a film director?
- Yes, I am.

601
01:02:07,901 --> 01:02:13,201
- I see.
- What do you do?

602
01:02:17,001 --> 01:02:18,701
I'm not doing anything.

603
01:02:19,901 --> 01:02:27,901
- I'm just drinking some milk.
- I see. You're not doing anything.

604
01:02:36,901 --> 01:02:42,901
So, are you a famous director?
Maybe someone I know?

605
01:02:47,001 --> 01:02:49,001
My name is Ham Chun-soo.

606
01:02:51,601 --> 01:02:56,601
- Seriously? Is that true?
- Yes.

607
01:02:58,601 --> 01:03:03,001
I know you very well!
You are a very famous director!

608
01:03:03,901 --> 01:03:05,001
I'm flattered.

609
01:03:07,001 --> 01:03:13,001
- But...are you really the director Ham Chun-soo?
- Of course.

610
01:03:14,401 --> 01:03:15,401
Really?

611
01:03:15,901 --> 01:03:18,901
Now I see!
That's why you seemed familiar!

612
01:03:18,902 --> 01:03:20,001
Is that so?

613
01:03:21,001 --> 01:03:23,301
- Nice to meet you!
- Nice to meet you, too!

614
01:03:26,001 --> 01:03:30,501
I hope I didn't bother you,
maybe you wanted to be alone.

615
01:03:30,502 --> 01:03:35,102
I'm the one who should say that. You were
trying to sleep, but then I showed up and...

616
01:03:35,103 --> 01:03:36,902
- I'm very sorry.
- Don't worry about that.

617
01:03:40,102 --> 01:03:41,602
Please, sit down.

618
01:03:41,603 --> 01:03:45,403
It's the place that I treasure
the most, that's why I came here.

619
01:03:45,404 --> 01:03:48,003
I see.

620
01:03:48,004 --> 01:03:50,404
It's the most beautiful place.

621
01:03:51,604 --> 01:03:52,604
Really?

622
01:03:57,004 --> 01:04:00,004
- So what is your occupation?
- Me?

623
01:04:00,804 --> 01:04:01,904
Well...

624
01:04:05,004 --> 01:04:07,604
You could say I'm a painter.

625
01:04:07,605 --> 01:04:10,005
I've not been painting for too long,

626
01:04:10,006 --> 01:04:13,106
but these days I'm only
living my life while painting.

627
01:04:19,106 --> 01:04:25,006
You even have traces of paint on your jacket!

628
01:04:25,007 --> 01:04:26,007
Yes.

629
01:04:28,106 --> 01:04:29,606
You're beautiful.

630
01:04:32,706 --> 01:04:34,006
Thanks...

631
01:04:36,506 --> 01:04:44,506
I used to have a different occupation.
But now I only live my life while painting.

632
01:04:53,306 --> 01:04:54,506
Perhaps...

633
01:04:57,806 --> 01:05:00,706
Would you like to drink
a cup of coffee with me?

634
01:05:00,707 --> 01:05:03,807
A warm coffee. Somewhere nearby.

635
01:05:05,607 --> 01:05:08,607
- Coffee?
- Yes. It's cold, so...

636
01:05:09,607 --> 01:05:14,007
I think it would be great.

637
01:05:15,207 --> 01:05:17,007
I'm quite embarrassed to ask you this.

638
01:05:19,007 --> 01:05:24,007
- Coffee?
- To be honest...

639
01:05:24,407 --> 01:05:28,207
I think I've seen you, earlier.

640
01:05:28,208 --> 01:05:33,108
- When you entered, I've seen you briefly.
- Really? Where?

641
01:05:35,808 --> 01:05:36,708
Right there.

642
01:05:39,808 --> 01:05:44,108
So can I buy you a coffee?
A warm coffee.

643
01:05:47,808 --> 01:05:49,808
Let's go for a coffee!

644
01:05:52,708 --> 01:05:58,508
In that case, it would be an honor,
drinking coffee with such a great director.

645
01:06:00,608 --> 01:06:01,408
Thank you!

646
01:06:02,008 --> 01:06:05,708
- Let's stand up, shall we?
- Yes.

647
01:06:07,508 --> 01:06:11,008
- I'll carry this for you.
- Thank you.

648
01:06:15,608 --> 01:06:16,808
Why are you looking inside?

649
01:06:17,809 --> 01:06:19,408
It looks tasty.

650
01:06:26,908 --> 01:06:29,308
You never drink coffee?

651
01:06:30,308 --> 01:06:34,308
I used to, but not anymore.
I became too sensitive.

652
01:06:36,408 --> 01:06:38,808
You really seem like a sensitive person.

653
01:06:40,808 --> 01:06:45,008
- But I really like the fragrance.
- You can drink just a little, if you want.

654
01:06:45,009 --> 01:06:48,609
No, thanks.
Please enjoy it yourself.

655
01:06:49,409 --> 01:06:50,509
Okay.

656
01:06:52,809 --> 01:06:57,009
A long time ago, I used to drink
a lot of alcohol and smoke a lot, too.

657
01:06:57,010 --> 01:06:59,209
When did you quit
smoking and drinking?

658
01:06:59,210 --> 01:07:00,810
A few years ago.

659
01:07:01,310 --> 01:07:04,010
I used to drink and smoke a lot...

660
01:07:05,010 --> 01:07:11,010
But then I realized it's not
how I want to live my life.

661
01:07:12,110 --> 01:07:14,110
So I changed my ways,
which wasn't easy.

662
01:07:14,111 --> 01:07:16,210
Wow, good for you!

663
01:07:24,910 --> 01:07:26,010
What are you doing today?

664
01:07:27,610 --> 01:07:31,710
- I'll have to drop by the atelier.
- Really? Where is it?

665
01:07:31,711 --> 01:07:35,411
- It's near the Haenggung Palace.
- I see.

666
01:07:35,412 --> 01:07:38,712
It'd be great if you can
show me your paintings.

667
01:07:39,612 --> 01:07:41,212
Aren't you busy?

668
01:07:41,213 --> 01:07:45,613
Well, I arrived a day early, like an idiot.
So today I have nothing to do.

669
01:07:46,813 --> 01:07:48,213
Why did you come early?

670
01:07:48,713 --> 01:07:51,113
The people there didn't contact me.

671
01:07:51,114 --> 01:07:55,714
The date was changed, and apparently they
tried to call me, but I missed their calls.

672
01:07:55,715 --> 01:07:59,815
- So what will you do now?
- They rented me a room.

673
01:07:59,816 --> 01:08:02,716
You know my hostel, right?
They rented me a room there.

674
01:08:02,717 --> 01:08:03,717
I see.

675
01:08:08,317 --> 01:08:09,917
Miss Hee-jung, where do you live?

676
01:08:09,918 --> 01:08:14,318
- You live nearby?
- If you walk up the hill, it's right up there.

677
01:08:16,218 --> 01:08:18,318
- Do you live with someone?
- With my mom.

678
01:08:21,518 --> 01:08:24,100
So you don't live with your father.

679
01:08:25,618 --> 01:08:27,718
He got divorced,
and now he's living in Seoul.

680
01:08:30,218 --> 01:08:33,118
- So you're living with your mother.
- Yes.

681
01:08:35,618 --> 01:08:37,418
Do you meet with your father,
from time to time?

682
01:08:39,600 --> 01:08:40,518
You don't?

683
01:08:42,318 --> 01:08:44,518
Why do you keep asking me
this sort of questions?

684
01:08:48,718 --> 01:08:53,018
I apologize.
I was just curious.

685
01:08:54,718 --> 01:08:57,718
You must be asking
out of sheer boredom.

686
01:08:57,719 --> 01:09:00,300
No, I'm not bored at all.

687
01:09:00,301 --> 01:09:03,319
I'm not the type of
person who gets bored.

688
01:09:04,419 --> 01:09:05,419
Me, neither.

689
01:09:06,419 --> 01:09:07,519
Really?

690
01:09:10,219 --> 01:09:15,100
I keep hearing everyone saying how bored
they are, but I'll never understand why.

691
01:09:15,101 --> 01:09:16,019
I know.

692
01:09:17,819 --> 01:09:20,919
Why would you be bored,
with so many things to do?

693
01:09:20,920 --> 01:09:21,919
I agree.

694
01:09:22,019 --> 01:09:23,919
I don't have time to get bored.

695
01:09:24,319 --> 01:09:28,219
I paint every day, I take care of the
household chores, I also have to study.

696
01:09:28,819 --> 01:09:31,219
Besides, I go out for a walk,
one hour every day.

697
01:09:32,219 --> 01:09:34,619
There's no time to get bored.

698
01:09:36,719 --> 01:09:37,719
That's great.

699
01:09:41,319 --> 01:09:44,619
Now I'm really curious about
what type of paintings you make.

700
01:09:45,719 --> 01:09:48,019
I'll show you my paintings,
if you're truly interested.

701
01:09:48,020 --> 01:09:49,819
Yes, I really am!

702
01:09:50,319 --> 01:09:51,119
Really?

703
01:09:52,019 --> 01:09:52,819
Yes.

704
01:10:01,000 --> 01:10:05,719
I always liked painting,
ever since I was little.

705
01:10:06,719 --> 01:10:09,000
No one encouraged me to start painting,

706
01:10:09,001 --> 01:10:14,020
But once I had white paper
and painting supplies...

707
01:10:15,121 --> 01:10:18,520
...my heart would always start racing.

708
01:10:18,821 --> 01:10:22,620
I know. Once I have paper and pencil,

709
01:10:22,621 --> 01:10:26,821
When I desire to write something,
I feel better for no apparent reason.

710
01:10:26,822 --> 01:10:28,822
- You get the same feeling?
- Yes.

711
01:10:29,122 --> 01:10:30,222
That's amazing.

712
01:10:30,922 --> 01:10:33,222
Yes.
We are alike.

713
01:10:37,222 --> 01:10:39,222
Miss Hee-jung, you seem
like a beautiful person.

714
01:10:41,622 --> 01:10:45,022
You strike me as a
very honest man, Director.

715
01:10:46,222 --> 01:10:48,122
But I'm not beautiful at all.

716
01:10:50,022 --> 01:10:51,322
I'm not beautiful.

717
01:10:52,522 --> 01:10:53,622
You are.

718
01:10:54,822 --> 01:10:57,522
It seems that
you don't know yourself.

719
01:11:00,622 --> 01:11:02,022
Stop teasing me, Director.

720
01:11:03,922 --> 01:11:05,022
I'm not teasing you.

721
01:12:31,122 --> 01:12:33,222
What are you thinking about?

722
01:12:33,223 --> 01:12:38,722
Me? I was thinking about you.
About the painting, as well.

723
01:12:40,422 --> 01:12:42,822
It's the first time when I try this.

724
01:12:44,122 --> 01:12:48,622
- It doesn't feel like it.
- Really?

725
01:12:48,623 --> 01:12:50,523
Yes, on the contrary.

726
01:12:51,623 --> 01:12:54,423
You definitely have skills.

727
01:12:54,924 --> 01:12:59,023
Really? I don't think so.
I still have a long way to go.

728
01:12:59,523 --> 01:13:01,823
It's nice, it really is.

729
01:13:04,423 --> 01:13:07,523
The quality is undeniable.

730
01:13:11,623 --> 01:13:16,723
But it feels as if... As if you're
taking solace into this painting.

731
01:13:19,000 --> 01:13:22,023
A painting made to
conceal your feelings.

732
01:13:25,123 --> 01:13:27,023
- You think so?
- Yes.

733
01:13:27,524 --> 01:13:30,523
Something that makes you feel at ease,
something that provides some consolation...

734
01:13:30,524 --> 01:13:33,024
That's the type of painting
you're creating here.

735
01:13:34,325 --> 01:13:37,625
You should express yourself
more bravely, but...

736
01:13:39,225 --> 01:13:44,725
But now you're going through
a hard time, you're lonely...

737
01:13:44,726 --> 01:13:49,400
That's why you reached a dead end.
Now you're hoping to erase it all,

738
01:13:49,401 --> 01:13:54,025
...so you took solace in painting.

739
01:13:56,525 --> 01:13:59,025
You're reading too much into it.

740
01:13:59,425 --> 01:14:00,725
You're really something...

741
01:14:00,726 --> 01:14:06,025
A sentiment of self-pity, that's
the feeling I get from this painting.

742
01:14:06,825 --> 01:14:08,625
But that's not a bad thing.

743
01:14:09,425 --> 01:14:11,925
You have to regain
control of your emotions, first.

744
01:14:14,325 --> 01:14:18,300
There's quality to it, I mean it.
The quality is there, but...

745
01:14:18,301 --> 01:14:20,826
What exactly are you looking at,
in order to feel all these things?

746
01:14:20,827 --> 01:14:27,427
...but it feels a little
bit too conventional.

747
01:14:27,828 --> 01:14:29,127
Being conventional is comfortable.

748
01:14:29,128 --> 01:14:32,528
When you're looking for solace, it's only
natural to find it in conventional things.

749
01:14:35,228 --> 01:14:39,327
Even so, there's quality to it.
But perhaps...

750
01:14:39,328 --> 01:14:44,400
Perhaps slightly too conventional.
You have to express yourself more boldly.

751
01:14:45,528 --> 01:14:47,800
Do you understand what I'm saying?

752
01:14:48,050 --> 01:14:48,728
Mhm.

753
01:14:49,129 --> 01:14:50,029
Is that so?

754
01:14:53,529 --> 01:14:57,629
I don't think I'm painting
just to find consolation...

755
01:14:59,729 --> 01:15:02,529
In that case, I'd better
find a man to sleep with.

756
01:15:02,530 --> 01:15:06,630
Oh, if... If you do that,
it would be even better!

757
01:15:06,631 --> 01:15:14,231
First you get consolation out of the way,
and you can focus on painting afterwards.

758
01:15:15,031 --> 01:15:19,031
If you keep thinking about painting over
and over and over, you might go crazy.

759
01:15:19,032 --> 01:15:27,032
You need to ease your mind, first.
You need a touch of love in your heart. 

760
01:15:27,033 --> 01:15:29,333
That's a very important thing.

761
01:15:29,933 --> 01:15:32,033
A hundred, a thousand
times more important!

762
01:15:37,133 --> 01:15:39,433
You shouldn't have bothered
coming all the way here.

763
01:15:39,434 --> 01:15:41,234
This painting is not
worth your effort...

764
01:15:41,235 --> 01:15:44,835
It's not like that,
please don't take it the wrong way.

765
01:15:44,836 --> 01:15:49,735
I just wanted to be honest with you
in my own way, so don't think like that.

766
01:15:49,736 --> 01:15:52,036
How do you know
what I'm thinking?

767
01:15:52,037 --> 01:15:54,537
That's right,
so please don't get mad.

768
01:15:54,538 --> 01:15:56,038
When did I get mad?

769
01:15:58,438 --> 01:16:00,538
Was it really necessary
to speak to me that way?

770
01:16:08,638 --> 01:16:09,938
I'm sorry.

771
01:16:16,838 --> 01:16:19,038
- Can I smoke?
- No.

772
01:16:20,100 --> 01:16:22,038
Smoking is prohibited in here.

773
01:16:26,438 --> 01:16:29,099
If you smoke,
I'll end up paying a fine.

774
01:16:29,100 --> 01:16:29,738
I see.

775
01:16:32,038 --> 01:16:35,738
In that case, I'll smoke
outside, I'll be right back.

776
01:16:35,739 --> 01:16:38,739
How can you speak so bluntly
about other people's works?

777
01:16:41,100 --> 01:16:43,039
You directors are all like that?

778
01:16:50,739 --> 01:16:51,339
Sure...

779
01:17:21,489 --> 01:17:22,839
Great view!

780
01:17:35,079 --> 01:17:37,039
Really nice!

781
01:17:39,880 --> 01:17:41,239
You can see everything from here.

782
01:17:42,939 --> 01:17:46,339
Miss Hee-jung, can you
see your house from here?

783
01:17:48,339 --> 01:17:52,139
Halfway up that mountain...
Yes, I can see it.

784
01:17:56,139 --> 01:17:58,539
Do you see that big
Buddha statue over there?

785
01:17:59,650 --> 01:18:03,639
Right below the statue, can you
spot a small portion of a big house?

786
01:18:05,909 --> 01:18:12,039
Well, I see the statue, but
I'm not sure about your house.

787
01:18:14,139 --> 01:18:17,039
Miss Hee-jung, are you rich?

788
01:18:17,340 --> 01:18:20,639
No, I only have the house.
I don't have money.

789
01:18:21,839 --> 01:18:24,000
A robber broke into my house, once.

790
01:18:25,139 --> 01:18:26,039
A robber?

791
01:18:26,839 --> 01:18:29,239
Yes, a few years back,
a robber broke inside the house.

792
01:18:30,939 --> 01:18:36,039
But he didn't steal anything,
and just left.

793
01:18:37,739 --> 01:18:39,039
Really?

794
01:18:39,740 --> 01:18:41,739
He only left his footprints.

795
01:18:45,339 --> 01:18:46,539
Why would he do that?

796
01:18:51,539 --> 01:18:53,839
That Buddha statue brings good luck.

797
01:18:58,739 --> 01:19:01,139
I used to hate that statue before.

798
01:19:01,140 --> 01:19:04,040
Having such a large statue
right behind the house...

799
01:19:05,940 --> 01:19:08,040
But one day,

800
01:19:09,041 --> 01:19:15,341
Strangely enough, that big statue
started to make me feel more at peace.

801
01:19:16,441 --> 01:19:19,441
As if it was protecting me.

802
01:19:23,841 --> 01:19:24,741
You're cute.

803
01:19:29,141 --> 01:19:32,041
Do you always speak out
so bluntly, Director?

804
01:19:32,842 --> 01:19:33,742
Why?

805
01:19:34,742 --> 01:19:36,042
You really are cute.

806
01:19:42,742 --> 01:19:45,542
It's cold. Let's go.

807
01:20:30,842 --> 01:20:34,642
- You sure drink a lot.
- Yes, that's true.

808
01:20:36,000 --> 01:20:38,042
- I'm sorry.
- Don't worry.

809
01:20:38,043 --> 01:20:41,243
If you want to drink, go ahead.
If it makes you feel good, why not.

810
01:20:42,143 --> 01:20:43,043
Yes...

811
01:20:48,743 --> 01:20:50,983
It's very good.

812
01:20:52,050 --> 01:20:54,044
- Should I pour you some more?
- Yes.

813
01:20:59,044 --> 01:21:02,044
Miss Hee-jung,
you should drink some, too.

814
01:21:03,024 --> 01:21:05,044
Yes, you go ahead and
drink, I'll drink too.

815
01:21:11,744 --> 01:21:16,044
- Okay, let's drink.
- Yes, let's do this.

816
01:21:23,144 --> 01:21:27,544
You drink really fast!
Your drinking skills are no joke.

817
01:21:29,144 --> 01:21:32,144
It's the first time when I see
someone drinking like this.

818
01:21:34,644 --> 01:21:36,544
You must be a real man!

819
01:21:39,744 --> 01:21:43,044
It's the first time for me, too.

820
01:21:44,544 --> 01:21:47,044
With such a beautiful lady...

821
01:21:49,544 --> 01:21:50,644
It's the first time.

822
01:21:53,144 --> 01:21:54,044
Really?

823
01:21:56,454 --> 01:21:59,944
Are you sure you're not saying
this to all the women you meet?

824
01:22:01,144 --> 01:22:07,444
You're not a casanova? I heard that
all film directors are womanizers.

825
01:22:09,944 --> 01:22:11,044
Really?

826
01:22:14,250 --> 01:22:16,200
I'm not sure if I'm a casanova.

827
01:22:26,000 --> 01:22:27,744
Do I look lonely?

828
01:22:28,100 --> 01:22:31,044
That's what you said earlier
while looking at my painting.

829
01:22:32,544 --> 01:22:38,244
I felt you're lonely from the first moment I
saw you, even before looking at your painting.

830
01:22:39,744 --> 01:22:44,044
But...you are very beautiful.

831
01:22:46,644 --> 01:22:48,544
How did you know I'm lonely?

832
01:22:50,900 --> 01:22:53,244
I didn't know, I just...

833
01:22:58,800 --> 01:23:00,344
I just felt that way.

834
01:23:02,200 --> 01:23:08,100
At the atelier, I shouldn't
have talked so much, right?

835
01:23:08,101 --> 01:23:09,245
Don't worry.

836
01:23:14,900 --> 01:23:18,145
The truth is, I...

837
01:23:20,545 --> 01:23:22,345
I have no friends.

838
01:23:25,100 --> 01:23:25,845
No?

839
01:23:27,045 --> 01:23:29,245
I don't know why.

840
01:23:32,145 --> 01:23:34,045
I can't make friends.

841
01:23:37,745 --> 01:23:39,545
It's probably my fault.

842
01:23:49,945 --> 01:23:54,545
You seem like you've always
been this type of person.

843
01:23:56,045 --> 01:23:58,745
But do you at least
meet with people?

844
01:23:59,145 --> 01:24:01,645
Yes, because it's a necessity.

845
01:24:04,945 --> 01:24:06,145
It's okay, then.

846
01:24:19,745 --> 01:24:22,245
Why do you give me that look?

847
01:24:26,945 --> 01:24:27,945
It feels strange.

848
01:24:38,845 --> 01:24:41,045
I have fallen in love, that's why.

849
01:24:49,545 --> 01:24:51,845
I really want to get married.

850
01:24:57,745 --> 01:24:58,645
Really?

851
01:24:59,646 --> 01:25:00,345
Yes.

852
01:25:04,545 --> 01:25:08,045
You're really peculiar.

853
01:25:11,845 --> 01:25:13,045
However...

854
01:25:16,045 --> 01:25:18,045
I won't be able to.

855
01:25:18,945 --> 01:25:19,645
What?

856
01:25:23,145 --> 01:25:25,000
I'm already married.

857
01:25:27,245 --> 01:25:29,245
I have two kids.

858
01:25:30,945 --> 01:25:31,845
Oh...

859
01:25:32,945 --> 01:25:34,045
But even so...

860
01:25:36,546 --> 01:25:38,046
Even so, I love you.

861
01:25:39,246 --> 01:25:43,746
Since the moment we talked
at the coffeeshop earlier,

862
01:25:47,346 --> 01:25:49,246
I have fallen in love with you.

863
01:25:55,546 --> 01:25:56,546
You did?

864
01:25:58,546 --> 01:26:04,046
Yes, that's what...
That's how I feel.

865
01:26:05,430 --> 01:26:06,746
After I...

866
01:26:09,300 --> 01:26:14,146
Tomorrow after I go back to Seoul,
I won't be able to see you again.

867
01:26:24,046 --> 01:26:27,246
We have to love the ones
that are dear to us, right?

868
01:26:32,700 --> 01:26:38,546
You must feel relieved now, after
being honest about your feelings.

869
01:26:48,646 --> 01:26:51,746
I'm a bit disappointed, though.

870
01:26:52,746 --> 01:26:53,846
Really?

871
01:27:00,846 --> 01:27:02,046
You're a bit disappointed?

872
01:27:04,446 --> 01:27:08,046
What are you so happy about?
You just said it won't work out.

873
01:27:11,046 --> 01:27:14,046
You're a bit disappointed, so...

874
01:27:21,546 --> 01:27:28,046
Now that you told me you're
a bit disappointed, I feel better.

875
01:27:30,746 --> 01:27:32,046
I feel better now.

876
01:27:45,046 --> 01:27:49,546
If we would've met a long time ago, 
it would've been much better.

877
01:27:51,046 --> 01:27:59,046
When you were younger, I bet you
were even more handsome than now.

878
01:28:01,046 --> 01:28:03,646
All the girls were
crazy about you, right?

879
01:28:07,000 --> 01:28:08,046
I don't know.

880
01:28:08,846 --> 01:28:11,546
I got married too early.

881
01:28:15,346 --> 01:28:17,446
So you got married early...

882
01:28:19,846 --> 01:28:20,746
Miss Hee-jung...

883
01:28:24,646 --> 01:28:26,046
You are very beautiful.

884
01:28:27,946 --> 01:28:29,446
So beautiful, that I...

885
01:28:33,946 --> 01:28:35,046
I love you.

886
01:29:08,546 --> 01:29:09,546
Oh...

887
01:29:10,246 --> 01:29:11,446
I...

888
01:29:14,546 --> 01:29:18,046
I'd like you to wear this,
at least once.

889
01:29:19,246 --> 01:29:20,546
What is this?

890
01:29:22,046 --> 01:29:25,046
I picked it up off the street.

891
01:29:27,546 --> 01:29:28,546
Wanna try it?

892
01:29:35,246 --> 01:29:38,346
I can't believe it,
it fits perfectly.

893
01:29:42,846 --> 01:29:44,846
Did you really pick
it up off the street?

894
01:29:46,846 --> 01:29:50,546
It looks intact.
It's beautiful!

895
01:29:51,846 --> 01:29:54,546
You can have it.
It's not expensive, anyway.

896
01:29:58,346 --> 01:30:01,246
This is our wedding ring.

897
01:30:04,946 --> 01:30:08,746
Oh, that's right!
It's our wedding ring.

898
01:30:09,546 --> 01:30:12,546
We got married!
We're married!

899
01:30:14,446 --> 01:30:16,246
- We got married!
- No we didn't.

900
01:30:18,450 --> 01:30:20,146
Director, you're cute.

901
01:30:26,146 --> 01:30:28,746
Thank you for the ring.

902
01:30:33,346 --> 01:30:35,046
Don't mention it.

903
01:30:37,646 --> 01:30:39,046
I'm the one who's grateful.

904
01:30:41,046 --> 01:30:45,446
Thank you for letting me
experience these strong emotions.

905
01:30:50,000 --> 01:30:51,846
I will...

906
01:30:56,246 --> 01:31:00,000
I will cherish these feelings
for the rest of my life.

907
01:31:11,046 --> 01:31:14,546
Shall we have a drink?
Please pour me some.

908
01:31:15,146 --> 01:31:17,046
Yes. Let's drink.

909
01:31:44,046 --> 01:31:49,046
- It's delicious.
- Yes, I like it, too.

910
01:32:01,346 --> 01:32:06,646
I'll go out for a smoke.
Wanna join me? Oh...

911
01:32:07,546 --> 01:32:09,646
That's right, you quit smoking.

912
01:32:09,647 --> 01:32:11,547
- I'll go by myself.
- Okay.

913
01:32:51,547 --> 01:32:52,547
What are you doing?

914
01:32:54,347 --> 01:32:56,047
Why did you come out?
It's cold.

915
01:32:57,747 --> 01:33:04,547
I have to go somewhere,
I totally forgot, I'm sorry.

916
01:33:06,947 --> 01:33:08,546
You're going somewhere?

917
01:33:08,547 --> 01:33:15,547
Yes, I have to go to a
friend's party, I totally forgot.

918
01:33:15,548 --> 01:33:18,848
Do you want to come with me?
It's a place where you can go, too.

919
01:33:20,000 --> 01:33:25,048
Where are we going?
It's her birthday, or something?

920
01:33:25,049 --> 01:33:30,848
No, she runs a café and we decided to meet this
evening, the two of us and a few other people.

921
01:33:30,849 --> 01:33:33,249
I really have to be there.

922
01:33:35,149 --> 01:33:36,549
What should we do?

923
01:33:38,349 --> 01:33:40,449
That's a good question.

924
01:33:43,049 --> 01:33:44,849
Do you want to come with me?

925
01:33:47,449 --> 01:33:50,249
If not, should we part ways?

926
01:33:51,150 --> 01:33:58,049
- No, no...
- You can come, she's a really good person.

927
01:34:01,649 --> 01:34:05,000
But I'm not one of her friends.

928
01:34:05,001 --> 01:34:10,050
It doesn't matter, she's very
kind, I'm sure she'll like you.

929
01:34:10,850 --> 01:34:12,750
You can come if you want.

930
01:34:18,250 --> 01:34:22,050
Okay, fine.
Let's go together.

931
01:34:22,051 --> 01:34:26,851
- After I finish smoking.
- In the meantime, I'll pay the bill.

932
01:34:26,852 --> 01:34:29,052
- No need to, let me do it!
- It's okay.

933
01:34:35,852 --> 01:34:37,952
I'm the one who should pay the bill...

934
01:35:02,100 --> 01:35:06,852
I'm so happy to have
met you like this, Director.

935
01:35:06,853 --> 01:35:08,953
I'm even happier.

936
01:35:09,553 --> 01:35:16,353
Whenever you release a new film, I watch
it on the first day, at the first screening.

937
01:35:17,353 --> 01:35:20,853
- So please treat me beautifully.
- You are very beautiful, already.

938
01:35:21,453 --> 01:35:28,853
Director, usually she's not like this,
but because she has fallen under your spell...

939
01:35:28,854 --> 01:35:30,453
Really?

940
01:35:30,454 --> 01:35:34,454
Director, you seem
like a very good man.

941
01:35:34,455 --> 01:35:35,754
I'm a huge fan!

942
01:35:37,154 --> 01:35:39,754
- You're the best, enough said!
- I don't deserve so much praise.

943
01:35:39,755 --> 01:35:44,154
You're by far the best of them all!

944
01:35:45,954 --> 01:35:49,154
- No one else can come near you.
- We understand, we got it.

945
01:35:50,054 --> 01:35:51,454
- Director.
- Yes.

946
01:35:51,455 --> 01:35:54,655
- I think I like you, too.
- You do?

947
01:35:55,556 --> 01:35:58,055
You seem different than how
the rumors describe you to be.

948
01:35:58,056 --> 01:35:59,500
What?

949
01:35:59,856 --> 01:36:02,856
You're more innocent than I expected.

950
01:36:05,100 --> 01:36:10,699
When you arrived with Hee-jung earlier,
I almost got the wrong impression.

951
01:36:10,700 --> 01:36:14,400
But you're more virtuous than I thought.

952
01:36:15,700 --> 01:36:17,500
You're a good man.

953
01:36:18,800 --> 01:36:20,900
Thank you very much.

954
01:36:22,700 --> 01:36:24,000
Thank you both.

955
01:36:24,300 --> 01:36:27,000
- Let's toast!
- Okay.

956
01:36:27,500 --> 01:36:28,700
Cheers!

957
01:36:34,500 --> 01:36:38,000
But I think I drank too much...

958
01:36:41,000 --> 01:36:45,000
When you're in a good mood,
the alcohol goes down smoothly.

959
01:36:47,500 --> 01:36:50,000
I shouldn't have drank so much...

960
01:36:59,400 --> 01:36:59,800
Oh my!

961
01:37:00,101 --> 01:37:02,201
- What's wrong?
- Director...

962
01:37:05,401 --> 01:37:06,901
Director, are you all right?

963
01:37:08,002 --> 01:37:09,101
What is happening to him?

964
01:37:09,402 --> 01:37:10,301
Director?

965
01:37:11,101 --> 01:37:13,201
- Is he all right?
- I don't know.

966
01:37:14,001 --> 01:37:14,901
Director...

967
01:37:19,401 --> 01:37:20,501
What should we do?

968
01:37:23,001 --> 01:37:24,801
Director, are you feeling well?

969
01:37:24,802 --> 01:37:26,001
Director...

970
01:37:27,501 --> 01:37:28,301
What now?

971
01:37:30,901 --> 01:37:31,901
Director?

972
01:37:32,901 --> 01:37:35,001
Get up, try to get up!

973
01:37:39,901 --> 01:37:41,201
Oh, I'm...

974
01:37:42,901 --> 01:37:44,401
I'm just...

975
01:37:44,402 --> 01:37:47,301
Don't worry, I'm just acting.

976
01:37:51,001 --> 01:37:52,901
What's the meaning of this?

977
01:37:54,001 --> 01:37:57,001
Well, I...

978
01:37:57,302 --> 01:37:58,800
Sometimes, I...

979
01:37:58,801 --> 01:37:59,801
I act!

980
01:38:01,100 --> 01:38:03,002
When I'm bored.
Out of boredom.

981
01:38:03,003 --> 01:38:05,103
You gave us a big scare!

982
01:38:06,303 --> 01:38:07,503
Startled, weren't you?

983
01:38:07,504 --> 01:38:11,504
You really scared us.
Why did you do that?

984
01:38:11,505 --> 01:38:13,505
I'm okay, seriously.

985
01:38:14,905 --> 01:38:18,005
Goodness!
You sure know how to act.

986
01:38:19,705 --> 01:38:24,005
I was just acting, just acting.
I'm quite good at it.

987
01:38:26,005 --> 01:38:29,405
- You sure you're all right?
- Of course I am.

988
01:38:30,805 --> 01:38:32,005
I'm okay.

989
01:38:33,805 --> 01:38:36,405
What a scare.
You really scared us.

990
01:38:36,406 --> 01:38:40,806
What can I say, I love acting.

991
01:38:48,406 --> 01:38:51,006
- He's drunk.
- He's wasted.

992
01:39:14,506 --> 01:39:15,506
Director...

993
01:39:16,106 --> 01:39:16,806
Yes.

994
01:39:23,870 --> 01:39:24,450
Oh dear...

995
01:39:26,670 --> 01:39:27,150
Oh dear!

996
01:39:30,106 --> 01:39:32,006
- What is this?
- Director, what are you doing?

997
01:39:40,506 --> 01:39:42,806
- My goodness!
- What should we do?

998
01:39:42,807 --> 01:39:44,107
What has gotten into this person?

999
01:39:44,507 --> 01:39:47,000
- Director, what do you think you're doing?
- What?

1000
01:39:47,001 --> 01:39:48,708
Why are you doing this to us?

1001
01:39:52,708 --> 01:39:54,008
He's crazy!

1002
01:39:54,709 --> 01:39:56,908
- Director.
- Yes.

1003
01:39:57,908 --> 01:39:59,458
We have to do something.

1004
01:39:59,459 --> 01:40:01,008
What's wrong with you?

1005
01:40:09,708 --> 01:40:11,408
Director, please control yourself!

1006
01:40:31,108 --> 01:40:33,908
- You're sleeping?
- No.

1007
01:40:43,608 --> 01:40:48,408
- Are you tired?
- No, I'm fine.

1008
01:40:51,408 --> 01:40:57,408
- How about you?
- I get ready to go.

1009
01:41:02,708 --> 01:41:03,908
You're leaving?

1010
01:41:05,908 --> 01:41:09,808
I have to go,
I'm suffocating in here.

1011
01:41:11,208 --> 01:41:14,008
I want to go out
for some fresh air.

1012
01:41:14,908 --> 01:41:16,208
Will you come with me?

1013
01:41:17,408 --> 01:41:18,608
Fresh air?

1014
01:41:21,608 --> 01:41:24,008
It's too cold outside.

1015
01:41:24,908 --> 01:41:28,908
It's okay. If you're cold,
I'll hold you tightly.

1016
01:41:31,008 --> 01:41:37,708
Let's go somewhere nice,
and have some fresh air.

1017
01:41:42,308 --> 01:41:46,000
If we leave together at this hour,

1018
01:41:46,001 --> 01:41:48,909
my friends might get the wrong idea.

1019
01:41:52,809 --> 01:41:55,509
That's true.
They might get the wrong idea.

1020
01:42:00,809 --> 01:42:05,309
Should I just tell them
that you're taking me home?

1021
01:42:05,310 --> 01:42:10,510
They trust you,
so I think it will be okay.

1022
01:42:13,510 --> 01:42:16,510
You go and tell them that, then.

1023
01:42:17,000 --> 01:42:19,810
What's the big deal, anyway?

1024
01:42:22,210 --> 01:42:27,510
We're just living our
lives the best we can.

1025
01:42:30,010 --> 01:42:31,310
What more can we ask for.

1026
01:42:35,810 --> 01:42:38,010
Should we go out, Director?

1027
01:42:43,710 --> 01:42:45,210
Let's go.

1028
01:42:47,210 --> 01:42:48,310
Come on.

1029
01:42:52,410 --> 01:42:57,110
Okay.
Let them think what they want.

1030
01:43:00,000 --> 01:43:01,010
That's right.

1031
01:43:02,710 --> 01:43:03,510
Great!

1032
01:43:21,010 --> 01:43:22,210
You're leaving?

1033
01:43:22,510 --> 01:43:27,210
Yes, we're about to go.
Professor, I had a great time.

1034
01:43:27,211 --> 01:43:31,111
- Professor, it was an honor.
- The honor was all mine, Director.

1035
01:43:31,112 --> 01:43:34,611
- I hope to see you again.
- Yes, I'm sure we'll meet again.

1036
01:43:34,612 --> 01:43:36,811
- Goodbye, Professor!
- Goodbye.

1037
01:43:36,812 --> 01:43:40,711
- Please take her home safely.
- I will! 

1038
01:43:41,900 --> 01:43:44,011
We'll have some fresh air,
then we'll go right home.

1039
01:43:44,012 --> 01:43:46,912
Okay, but please be careful, it's cold.

1040
01:43:47,112 --> 01:43:51,112
I hope you'll forgive me for
the mistake that I made today.

1041
01:43:51,113 --> 01:43:54,013
- Goodbye!
- Be extra careful.

1042
01:43:54,414 --> 01:43:56,413
You are two precious human beings.

1043
01:43:57,713 --> 01:44:01,013
- Take care, Professor!
- You too, Hee-jung.

1044
01:44:02,213 --> 01:44:04,413
- It's cold!
- It's okay.

1045
01:44:04,414 --> 01:44:05,513
Good night!

1046
01:44:37,913 --> 01:44:39,813
Should we go to Kangwon Province?

1047
01:44:41,913 --> 01:44:43,313
Where in Kangwon?

1048
01:44:46,513 --> 01:44:48,313
At the Gyeongpo Beach, maybe.

1049
01:44:48,850 --> 01:44:50,013
Shall we?

1050
01:44:50,680 --> 01:44:51,613
Yes.

1051
01:45:06,113 --> 01:45:08,413
How expensive is the taxi fare?

1052
01:45:09,113 --> 01:45:10,413
Pretty expensive, right?

1053
01:45:12,813 --> 01:45:15,812
I don't know,
maybe around 100.000 Won?

1054
01:45:15,813 --> 01:45:20,013
I'm not sure, I've
never been there by taxi.

1055
01:45:21,613 --> 01:45:24,913
- Around 100.000 Won?
- Yes.

1056
01:45:36,913 --> 01:45:37,313
Hop in!

1057
01:45:38,813 --> 01:45:41,613
Do we take it from here,
or from the other side?

1058
01:45:42,613 --> 01:45:43,513
Oh, well...

1059
01:45:47,113 --> 01:45:48,313
I'm not sure.

1060
01:45:48,314 --> 01:45:54,714
Let's go towards the market square,
there's a taxi rank there.

1061
01:45:55,614 --> 01:45:57,514
Yes, okay, let's do that.

1062
01:46:14,114 --> 01:46:17,020
Mom! I'm almost home,
go to sleep.

1063
01:46:17,021 --> 01:46:18,413
Who are you with?

1064
01:46:18,814 --> 01:46:21,814
What? I'm alone,
I'm on my way home.

1065
01:46:22,215 --> 01:46:25,593
Soo-young told me you
left with a film director.

1066
01:46:25,594 --> 01:46:28,014
But why did you leave
without telling her a word?

1067
01:46:28,514 --> 01:46:32,514
She was worried you were
kidnapped by that lunatic.

1068
01:46:33,514 --> 01:46:34,514
Really?

1069
01:46:35,314 --> 01:46:38,914
But why do you call him
a lunatic, all of a sudden?

1070
01:46:38,915 --> 01:46:41,214
You should choose your
words more carefully.

1071
01:46:41,514 --> 01:46:43,514
That director is crazy!

1072
01:46:43,515 --> 01:46:46,115
Why would he get naked
in front of two women?

1073
01:46:48,315 --> 01:46:50,000
When did he get naked?

1074
01:46:51,215 --> 01:46:53,015
You're clueless.

1075
01:46:54,015 --> 01:47:01,115
He even took off his underwear,
in front of Soo-young. You dummy!

1076
01:47:01,615 --> 01:47:04,515
- You didn't see anything?
- No, I had no idea.

1077
01:47:05,015 --> 01:47:09,015
But why would he do that?

1078
01:47:09,815 --> 01:47:12,315
How should I know?
He's crazy, why else.

1079
01:47:15,715 --> 01:47:19,515
- He really did that?
- I just told you!

1080
01:47:20,515 --> 01:47:23,215
What kind of nutcase
are you hanging around with?

1081
01:47:24,015 --> 01:47:28,715
Hanging around?
I just met him, by chance. By chance!

1082
01:47:29,415 --> 01:47:33,915
- Anyway, are you really alone?
- Of course I am.

1083
01:47:33,916 --> 01:47:38,016
Just calm down already.
I'm coming home right now.

1084
01:47:38,017 --> 01:47:40,217
I'm in front of the Haenggung Palace,
I'll be home soon.

1085
01:47:40,617 --> 01:47:43,317
- Come home quicky!
- I will.

1086
01:47:55,417 --> 01:47:57,717
Did you strip in front of my friends?

1087
01:48:00,317 --> 01:48:01,317
Yes...

1088
01:48:04,617 --> 01:48:08,117
It was too hot.
That's why I did that.

1089
01:48:14,517 --> 01:48:18,017
Besides, I was drunk, and...

1090
01:48:25,317 --> 01:48:33,017
Something must have bothered me,
I was feeling stuffy.

1091
01:48:38,017 --> 01:48:41,117
- I'm sorry for that, Hee-jung.
- So it was true?

1092
01:48:43,217 --> 01:48:44,617
Yes, I...

1093
01:48:46,617 --> 01:48:48,517
How could I miss this?

1094
01:48:48,518 --> 01:48:52,118
No, please don't say that.
It's great that you weren't there. 

1095
01:48:53,017 --> 01:48:55,917
You really are peculiar.

1096
01:48:57,717 --> 01:49:04,317
I don't know why I did that, either.
I just... felt the need to do it.

1097
01:49:07,517 --> 01:49:09,117
I wonder why?

1098
01:49:12,917 --> 01:49:14,717
I'm sorry your friends
had to see me like that...

1099
01:49:14,718 --> 01:49:17,018
- Hee-jung!
- Hi!

1100
01:49:22,718 --> 01:49:27,218
But what if they'll
file a complaint against me?

1101
01:49:27,519 --> 01:49:30,518
Soo-young is fully
capable of doing just that.

1102
01:49:30,519 --> 01:49:32,519
- Seriously?
- You bet.

1103
01:49:34,219 --> 01:49:35,419
I sure hope not.

1104
01:49:36,320 --> 01:49:37,220
But...

1105
01:49:39,820 --> 01:49:42,520
I'll talk to her.

1106
01:49:42,820 --> 01:49:46,020
Don't worry. After I talk to
her, I'm sure she'll understand.

1107
01:49:46,021 --> 01:49:46,821
Yes?

1108
01:49:47,921 --> 01:49:49,421
That's a relief.

1109
01:49:51,421 --> 01:49:56,521
- I shouldn't have drank so much...
- I kept telling you to drink less!

1110
01:49:58,221 --> 01:50:01,121
- It's cold.
- You're cold?

1111
01:50:01,521 --> 01:50:05,000
I'm cold! Let's go, hurry up.

1112
01:50:09,000 --> 01:50:09,800
So cold!

1113
01:50:20,300 --> 01:50:24,300
This way. Just a moment, my mom
might come out any minute.

1114
01:50:28,200 --> 01:50:32,000
At the end of this road,
that's the house where I live.

1115
01:50:32,601 --> 01:50:33,501
Okay.

1116
01:50:37,001 --> 01:50:41,101
Are you...
Going home?

1117
01:50:41,102 --> 01:50:45,501
Of course, I have to.
We've been in the cold for too long.

1118
01:50:45,802 --> 01:50:46,501
Yes...

1119
01:50:47,901 --> 01:50:52,701
But...
Can't you come back, later?

1120
01:50:53,501 --> 01:50:58,001
I'd like to talk to you some more.

1121
01:50:58,802 --> 01:51:03,601
We're freezing, and
we drank so much...

1122
01:51:04,501 --> 01:51:08,101
You're freezing, too!

1123
01:51:08,102 --> 01:51:10,002
Not at all, I...

1124
01:51:11,702 --> 01:51:19,002
I'd really like to
talk to you some more.

1125
01:51:20,702 --> 01:51:22,002
If it's possible.

1126
01:51:24,102 --> 01:51:31,302
- Are you serious?
- Yes. Can you come out later?

1127
01:51:36,002 --> 01:51:39,702
- Okay, I'll go in, then I'll come back.
- Great.

1128
01:51:40,002 --> 01:51:43,802
Once I go to my room, my mom will
fall asleep, that's when I'll sneak out.

1129
01:51:43,803 --> 01:51:47,502
But how can you wait like this?
Outside, in the cold...

1130
01:51:47,503 --> 01:51:51,103
I can. If you come out, I'll wait.

1131
01:51:54,503 --> 01:51:55,303
Very well.

1132
01:51:56,103 --> 01:51:59,003
I'm going in for now,
then I'll come back.

1133
01:52:02,603 --> 01:52:06,803
- It's my mom! I have to go.
- Sure, go.

1134
01:52:14,003 --> 01:52:17,103
Next time,
I'll kiss you on the lips.

1135
01:52:20,050 --> 01:52:22,003
- Wait for me.
- I'll be waiting.

1136
01:52:24,703 --> 01:52:27,103
- Hee-jung. What were you doing there?
- Why did you get out?

1137
01:52:30,103 --> 01:52:31,503
Why did you get out?

1138
01:52:36,003 --> 01:52:38,503
What were you doing there?
Is someone there?

1139
01:52:38,504 --> 01:52:40,504
What are you talking about?

1140
01:52:42,104 --> 01:52:45,504
- Then, what were you doing there?
- I was smoking a cigarette.

1141
01:52:46,704 --> 01:52:50,104
I didn't know how you would react,
so I stopped there for a smoke.

1142
01:52:50,604 --> 01:52:51,504
Really?

1143
01:52:52,005 --> 01:52:53,505
Were you really smoking?

1144
01:52:53,905 --> 01:52:57,505
It was so difficult for you to
quit smoking, why did you relapse?

1145
01:52:58,805 --> 01:53:02,605
I just felt like it,
after drinking.

1146
01:54:06,805 --> 01:54:09,905
- Are you tired, Director?
- No, I'm okay.

1147
01:54:09,906 --> 01:54:11,606
Just a small hangover.
I'm fine.

1148
01:54:11,607 --> 01:54:15,706
Thanks to your hard work, the audience
gained a lot of insight today.

1149
01:54:15,707 --> 01:54:18,207
Please, I don't deserve such praise.

1150
01:54:18,208 --> 01:54:20,708
No, you explained
everything in great detail,

1151
01:54:20,709 --> 01:54:24,508
I was so surprised, I didn't expect
you'll be so considerate to them.

1152
01:54:24,509 --> 01:54:27,709
A lot of students showed up,
so it just turned out that way.

1153
01:54:29,009 --> 01:54:32,309
But what was up with
that guy wearing glasses?

1154
01:54:32,310 --> 01:54:34,910
Tell me about it...
He just couldn't get over himself.

1155
01:54:34,911 --> 01:54:39,411
No matter how much he talked,
I still have no idea what his question was.

1156
01:54:39,412 --> 01:54:42,412
He was just showing off
in front of the ladies.

1157
01:54:42,413 --> 01:54:43,813
- Really?
- Most likely.

1158
01:54:44,513 --> 01:54:46,713
- Do you mind if we shake hands?
- Not at all.

1159
01:54:47,300 --> 01:54:49,000
Thank you. Thank you very much.

1160
01:54:50,713 --> 01:54:53,413
How will you go back to Seoul?
Did you bring your car?

1161
01:54:53,414 --> 01:54:56,814
No, I don't own a car.
I'll just take the subway.

1162
01:54:57,714 --> 01:55:00,000
In that case, miss Bora
can give you a ride.

1163
01:55:00,001 --> 01:55:02,815
Don't worry,
I'll just take a taxi.

1164
01:55:02,816 --> 01:55:05,715
It's the least we can do for you.
Miss Bora, do you mind?

1165
01:55:05,716 --> 01:55:07,950
Of course not.
I'll give you a ride.

1166
01:55:07,951 --> 01:55:11,216
You're too kind.
Thank you!

1167
01:55:15,816 --> 01:55:17,016
Excuse me.

1168
01:55:20,816 --> 01:55:24,716
- You're here!
- Yes. The lecture went well?

1169
01:55:24,717 --> 01:55:28,517
- Yes.
- I'm here to watch your film.

1170
01:55:28,518 --> 01:55:30,018
Oh, it's screening right now?

1171
01:55:31,119 --> 01:55:34,619
I had to run to arrive on time.

1172
01:55:35,619 --> 01:55:38,019
- Are you okay?
- Yes.

1173
01:55:38,020 --> 01:55:39,950
It's the first time when
I watch one of your films.

1174
01:55:39,951 --> 01:55:42,520
Oh, really?
Thank you!

1175
01:55:44,320 --> 01:55:48,000
I'm going back to Seoul, now.

1176
01:55:48,001 --> 01:55:49,421
- Really?
- Yes.

1177
01:55:49,422 --> 01:55:52,622
Then I'm glad we at least
got to meet here like this.

1178
01:55:53,422 --> 01:55:54,522
Yes, me too.

1179
01:55:55,822 --> 01:56:01,972
- Will you be all right?
- Yes, don't worry about it.

1180
01:56:01,973 --> 01:56:03,123
Are you sure?

1181
01:56:04,023 --> 01:56:07,323
- Soo-young said she understands.
- What?

1182
01:56:07,900 --> 01:56:12,523
She says she can forgive you,
since you're an artist.

1183
01:56:13,423 --> 01:56:16,923
- Really? So she understands...
- Yes.

1184
01:56:22,000 --> 01:56:23,822
Thank you for everything.

1185
01:56:25,200 --> 01:56:27,223
I'm grateful, too.

1186
01:56:30,323 --> 01:56:34,423
I have to go inside.
The movie is about to start.

1187
01:56:34,424 --> 01:56:38,924
- Yes, hurry up and go inside.
- Yes. Have a safe trip back to Seoul.

1188
01:56:38,925 --> 01:56:40,000
Goodbye.

1189
01:56:47,000 --> 01:56:51,724
- Who was that?
- Oh, someone that I know since a while back.

1190
01:57:29,024 --> 01:57:30,324
I'm going, now.

1191
01:57:31,100 --> 01:57:32,724
- You're going?
- Yes.

1192
01:57:35,324 --> 01:57:37,910
Sorry for last night,
I couldn't sneak out.

1193
01:57:37,911 --> 01:57:41,125
It's all right, I didn't wait
long anyway, it was very cold.

1194
01:57:41,126 --> 01:57:42,626
- Really?
- Yes.

1195
01:57:43,926 --> 01:57:47,926
- So you're going to watch this one.
- Yes, it looks interesting.

1196
01:57:48,926 --> 01:57:50,626
I hope you like it.

1197
01:57:51,527 --> 01:57:53,026
I missed you.

1198
01:57:56,426 --> 01:57:57,426
Me too.

1199
01:57:58,526 --> 01:58:02,326
Director,
I'll enjoy your film.

1200
01:58:02,327 --> 01:58:04,827
From now on,
I'll watch all your films.

1201
01:58:07,427 --> 01:58:08,426
Thank you.

1202
01:58:08,427 --> 01:58:12,927
I'm the one who's thankful.
I'm so happy that I met you.

1203
01:58:15,327 --> 01:58:16,827
Yes, me too.

1204
01:58:21,727 --> 01:58:23,827
I'm going, now.

1205
01:58:24,927 --> 01:58:26,227
Okay, goodbye.

1206
01:58:26,827 --> 01:58:30,027
- Bye!
- Bye.
