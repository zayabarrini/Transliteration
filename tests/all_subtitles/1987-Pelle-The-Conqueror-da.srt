1
00:00:22,655 --> 00:00:27,592
"Pelle the Conqueror"

2
00:01:49,342 --> 00:01:53,176
- Papa?
- Pelle, everything's just fine.

3
00:01:53,279 --> 00:01:55,873
Please, tell me about it again.

4
00:01:57,350 --> 00:02:00,615
This new land is very different
from the one we left.

5
00:02:00,720 --> 00:02:04,087
- They live a peculiar life.
- Tell me again how I won't believe my eyes.

6
00:02:04,190 --> 00:02:06,454
And when they cook a pork roast...

7
00:02:06,559 --> 00:02:08,584
it's all covered with raisins...

8
00:02:08,695 --> 00:02:11,095
and they put butter
on their bread...

9
00:02:11,197 --> 00:02:13,995
at least half-an-inch
thick of butter.

10
00:02:14,100 --> 00:02:16,625
Now, the brandy...

11
00:02:16,736 --> 00:02:18,761
it's cheaper than water.

12
00:02:18,872 --> 00:02:21,841
But it's strong-- strong enough
to kill an ox.

13
00:02:21,941 --> 00:02:26,537
But don't worry. It's not too strong
for your father, Pelle. He's hard.

14
00:02:26,646 --> 00:02:28,671
And children are free all day.

15
00:02:28,781 --> 00:02:31,477
Yeah, Pelle, yeah.

16
00:02:31,584 --> 00:02:33,643
Tell me about it again, Papa.

17
00:02:33,753 --> 00:02:37,587
The wages in Denmark
are so incredibly high that boys don't--

18
00:02:37,690 --> 00:02:40,022
Boys don't have to
go out to work, you said.

19
00:02:40,126 --> 00:02:42,560
- They can play. They can play all day long.
- Yeah.

20
00:03:46,292 --> 00:03:48,192
Don't worry.

21
00:03:49,796 --> 00:03:51,821
Go over there.

22
00:03:53,199 --> 00:03:55,394
They won't fool me.

23
00:03:56,636 --> 00:03:59,161
I won't jump at the first offer.

24
00:04:12,252 --> 00:04:14,516
Go over there.

25
00:04:17,257 --> 00:04:21,819
- Your papers. Your papers.
- Here.

26
00:04:21,928 --> 00:04:23,862
This is my son.

27
00:04:23,963 --> 00:04:27,057
- Is your wife with you?
- She's dead.

28
00:04:27,166 --> 00:04:29,396
We come from Tomelilla, Sweden.

29
00:04:46,686 --> 00:04:50,986
<i>My name is Lasse Karlsson.</i>
<i>I'm offering you my services.</i>

30
00:04:55,995 --> 00:04:59,226
That man looks like
he would be kind to children.

31
00:05:02,335 --> 00:05:05,304
Hello. My name is Lasse Karlsson
from Tomelilla.

32
00:05:05,405 --> 00:05:07,532
I'm here to offer my services.

33
00:05:07,640 --> 00:05:10,507
You should have stayed
in Sweden. You're too old.

34
00:05:22,455 --> 00:05:25,686
Hello. Lasse Karlsson
from Tomelilla.

35
00:05:25,792 --> 00:05:28,124
I'm here to offer my--

36
00:05:28,227 --> 00:05:30,855
I shouldn't take the first offer.

37
00:05:39,205 --> 00:05:41,400
My name is Lasse Karlsson
from Tomelilla.

38
00:05:41,507 --> 00:05:43,475
I'm offering my--

39
00:06:10,236 --> 00:06:12,932
Hello. My name is Lasse Karlsson
from Tomelilla.

40
00:06:13,039 --> 00:06:14,939
I'm here to offer my services.

41
00:06:15,041 --> 00:06:17,976
You're too old, Swede,
and the boy is too young.

42
00:06:22,248 --> 00:06:25,843
I'm not-- I'm not gonna
take the first job offer.

43
00:06:27,120 --> 00:06:29,350
I'm not gonna do it.

44
00:07:02,188 --> 00:07:04,247
You're too late.

45
00:07:06,526 --> 00:07:08,824
You were on the boat from Sweden?

46
00:07:10,730 --> 00:07:12,755
<i>Where are your parents?</i>

47
00:07:42,061 --> 00:07:45,224
Hello. My name is Lasse
Karlsson from Tomelilla. I am offering--

48
00:07:45,331 --> 00:07:47,629
<i>Let me see your papers.</i>

49
00:08:00,746 --> 00:08:03,715
I'll pay you 100 krone a year,
including the boy--your son.

50
00:09:09,782 --> 00:09:12,478
Dear sweet Jesus.

51
00:09:15,288 --> 00:09:18,621
- You'll sleep in there.

52
00:09:23,896 --> 00:09:25,864
<i>Any questions, ask me...</i>

53
00:09:25,965 --> 00:09:28,263
or my assistant.

54
00:10:29,562 --> 00:10:31,792
<i>Stop doing that!</i>

55
00:10:31,897 --> 00:10:34,957
Come back here! Stupid animals!

56
00:10:35,067 --> 00:10:38,901
- <i>You'll get me in trouble.</i>
- You won't get away from me, you dumb beast!

57
00:10:39,005 --> 00:10:41,940
You'll do what I tell ya.

58
00:10:42,041 --> 00:10:44,407
That's it. Move it.

59
00:10:47,279 --> 00:10:51,613
<i>You gotta learn how to treat 'em.</i>
<i>Hit 'em on the teats. Then they'll listen.</i>

60
00:10:51,717 --> 00:10:54,345
<i>The teats or the hind legs.</i>

61
00:11:00,393 --> 00:11:03,123
<i>Hit 'em.</i>

62
00:11:03,229 --> 00:11:05,993
<i>Keep moving. I said keep moving.</i>

63
00:11:11,570 --> 00:11:14,562
- Move. Keep moving.
- Stupid cows.

64
00:11:21,047 --> 00:11:23,106
If you help me with the cattle...

65
00:11:23,215 --> 00:11:25,843
and teach me to talk like a Dane...

66
00:11:25,951 --> 00:11:28,351
I'll share my food with ya.

67
00:11:29,989 --> 00:11:33,584
Always carry a stone.
When a cow starts to run away...

68
00:11:33,693 --> 00:11:35,593
you throw it at her.

69
00:11:35,695 --> 00:11:38,892
You take a good aim, you throw it
and you call her name.

70
00:11:38,998 --> 00:11:42,263
Then she'll come back.
And she'll know who's boss.

71
00:11:42,368 --> 00:11:44,393
- <i>What's your name?</i>
- Rud.

72
00:11:44,503 --> 00:11:46,198
"Rut"?

73
00:11:46,305 --> 00:11:49,103
Rud, with the tongue.

74
00:11:49,208 --> 00:11:51,574
Rud. Rud.

75
00:11:52,878 --> 00:11:55,244
If you put your head
between your legs...

76
00:11:55,347 --> 00:11:57,872
and the sun is just above
the trees over there...

77
00:11:57,983 --> 00:12:00,042
then it's time to give them water.

78
00:12:00,152 --> 00:12:03,121
- The larks' song will tell you too.
- <i>"Rut!"</i>

79
00:12:03,222 --> 00:12:06,749
<i>My mother's from Sweden.</i></i>

80
00:12:06,859 --> 00:12:09,623
- <i>She can't say my name right either.</i>
- Rut!

81
00:12:09,729 --> 00:12:13,096
Here's the food I promised.

82
00:12:13,199 --> 00:12:15,167
Rut!

83
00:12:26,579 --> 00:12:29,309
<i>New man.</i>

84
00:12:29,415 --> 00:12:32,043
Just what is that cow doing there?

85
00:12:32,151 --> 00:12:34,483
Why is Gabriella there?

86
00:12:40,893 --> 00:12:44,124
<i>Why is Gabriella there?</i>

87
00:12:44,230 --> 00:12:48,599
<i>The girls can't find their cows</i>
<i>when you move them around.</i>

88
00:12:48,701 --> 00:12:50,601
Aspasia. Can't you read?

89
00:12:50,703 --> 00:12:52,967
Just as it's written.

90
00:12:53,072 --> 00:12:55,438
A-spa-si-a.

91
00:12:59,145 --> 00:13:03,275
Uh, are you saying there is
a difference where a cow stands?

92
00:13:09,755 --> 00:13:11,985
<i>Kongstrup is back.</i>

93
00:13:15,261 --> 00:13:17,729
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

94
00:13:30,075 --> 00:13:33,704
Erik, why haven't you
unharnessed the horses?

95
00:13:36,882 --> 00:13:39,316
Because I want to eat my food first.

96
00:13:39,418 --> 00:13:42,478
What do you say?

97
00:13:42,588 --> 00:13:46,319
I say you unharness
those horses right now. Come on!

98
00:13:46,425 --> 00:13:50,225
<i>Those horses are more important</i>
<i>than your stomach, you lazy dog!</i>

99
00:14:35,841 --> 00:14:37,934
Do you know the punishment
for stealing milk?

100
00:14:39,979 --> 00:14:42,971
You could be whipped for it.

101
00:14:43,082 --> 00:14:45,710
Well, I won't report you this time.

102
00:14:55,761 --> 00:14:58,889
You know, Pelle,
I've been thinking.

103
00:14:58,998 --> 00:15:01,193
I like you.

104
00:15:01,300 --> 00:15:03,461
So I'll tell you a secret.

105
00:15:03,569 --> 00:15:06,163
I know where you can find
a lot of gold coins...

106
00:15:06,272 --> 00:15:09,469
but you've gotta keep it a secret.

107
00:15:09,575 --> 00:15:12,271
A real secret. You promise?

108
00:15:18,550 --> 00:15:22,611
Just come in here, Pelle,
very quietly.

109
00:15:22,721 --> 00:15:27,920
The raven can be dangerous
if it hears us. Come.

110
00:15:52,017 --> 00:15:54,679
Where are you?

111
00:15:58,290 --> 00:16:01,123
<i>Sir?</i>

112
00:16:01,226 --> 00:16:03,421
Are you here?</i>

113
00:16:05,698 --> 00:16:08,667
Are you here?

114
00:16:43,702 --> 00:16:46,967
<i>Jump, you stinking Swede! Jump!</i>

115
00:16:48,307 --> 00:16:50,537
- <i>Jump!</i>

116
00:16:52,678 --> 00:16:54,669
No-good, rotten little bastard!

117
00:16:54,780 --> 00:16:57,578
- <i>Let's see how you like it!</i>
- Help!

118
00:16:57,683 --> 00:17:01,050
That's enough! Stop it, or I'll turn
both of you in to the authorities!

119
00:17:01,153 --> 00:17:03,644
- I said that's enough!
- Little son of a bitch!

120
00:17:03,756 --> 00:17:05,917
- Help!
- <i>Erik, I'm warning you.</i>

121
00:17:06,025 --> 00:17:09,483
<i>I'll</i>-- <i>I'll turn you in!</i>

122
00:17:15,334 --> 00:17:19,031
You get out of here fast.
You're lucky I was here to save your pelt.

123
00:17:19,138 --> 00:17:21,368
Now get going.

124
00:17:45,197 --> 00:17:48,758
<i>He'll pay for what he did.</i>
<i>You can be sure of that.</i>

125
00:17:48,867 --> 00:17:51,495
You got your father's word of honor.

126
00:17:51,603 --> 00:17:54,595
- I promise you I'll...
- Kill him?

127
00:17:54,706 --> 00:17:57,106
kill the filthy swine.

128
00:17:57,209 --> 00:18:00,542
- You're really gonna do it?
- I've given you my word.

129
00:18:00,646 --> 00:18:03,410
- How?
- Yeah, how?

130
00:18:03,515 --> 00:18:05,847
How are you gonna kill him?

131
00:18:08,821 --> 00:18:11,984
- With a hammer, I think.
- Knock out his brains?

132
00:18:12,091 --> 00:18:14,252
- Yeah.
- You'll really do it?

133
00:18:14,359 --> 00:18:16,452
He's as good as dead.

134
00:18:18,964 --> 00:18:23,094
But then who's going
to read all the names of the cows?

135
00:18:26,572 --> 00:18:28,472
You're right.

136
00:18:30,642 --> 00:18:34,942
Yeah. We'd better settle
for a thrashing...

137
00:18:36,281 --> 00:18:39,717
so he can still read for us, yeah.

138
00:18:39,818 --> 00:18:43,652
I'll give that one a flogging
that he'll never forget.

139
00:18:54,933 --> 00:18:57,458
<i>Yarn for the boy's gray socks.</i>

140
00:18:57,569 --> 00:19:00,834
The patch was for the--
what did she say-- Oh, yes.

141
00:19:00,939 --> 00:19:04,966
The Sunday sweater your mother said.

142
00:19:05,077 --> 00:19:09,571
She said that-- She said that
the sleeves should be let down a little bit.

143
00:19:11,450 --> 00:19:16,387
You know, your mother was a-- She was
so worried about you just before she died.

144
00:19:16,488 --> 00:19:19,582
She didn't think I could
take care of you, Pelle.

145
00:19:19,691 --> 00:19:23,183
"Don't let him wear
those socks too long.

146
00:19:23,295 --> 00:19:26,662
- Don't let him wear them through."
- <i>Lasse?</i>

147
00:19:26,765 --> 00:19:28,665
<i>Lasse?</i>

148
00:19:38,810 --> 00:19:41,210
It's him.

149
00:19:45,517 --> 00:19:47,644
Where are you,
you Swedish bumpkin?

150
00:19:47,753 --> 00:19:50,347
Are you going to do it now?

151
00:19:51,456 --> 00:19:53,219
Yeah?

152
00:20:11,977 --> 00:20:14,571
<i>Sir, I wish to protest</i>
<i>what you did to my son.</i>

153
00:20:14,680 --> 00:20:18,013
What you did to him,
I want to protest.

154
00:20:18,116 --> 00:20:21,483
Why don't you answer when I call?

155
00:20:21,587 --> 00:20:24,750
Sir, I wanted to, uh--

156
00:20:24,856 --> 00:20:29,350
- I wanted to protest about the way that Pelle was--
- You want trouble?

157
00:20:29,461 --> 00:20:32,624
I could report you to the manager.

158
00:20:37,536 --> 00:20:41,734
Aspasia will not be going
out to pasture tomorrow.

159
00:20:41,840 --> 00:20:46,174
- She's ready to calve?
- That's right. Did you think she was gonna foal?

160
00:21:09,635 --> 00:21:11,865
Just lie there and whimper...

161
00:21:11,970 --> 00:21:15,667
but if one can't read Aspasia's name,
one has to show a little respect.

162
00:21:15,774 --> 00:21:19,676
I know Aspasia!
She's the third one from the door!

163
00:21:19,778 --> 00:21:22,212
You promised, Papa!

164
00:21:22,314 --> 00:21:25,249
Knowing that she's the third one
from the door, it's not--

165
00:21:25,350 --> 00:21:29,218
- it's not at all the same as reading her name.
- You promised!

166
00:21:29,321 --> 00:21:33,121
I'm your father. You should show respect
and stop carrying on.

167
00:21:35,260 --> 00:21:37,888
Lasse's old and poor.

168
00:21:37,996 --> 00:21:41,659
What's left? No respect.

169
00:21:41,767 --> 00:21:45,635
They can do what they want with you.

170
00:21:45,737 --> 00:21:47,671
You have shorter breath.

171
00:21:47,773 --> 00:21:51,072
You worry about your heart
and your blood pressure.

172
00:21:51,176 --> 00:21:54,942
That's what getting old is like.
But you're young.

173
00:21:55,047 --> 00:21:58,505
You can still conquer
the whole world.

174
00:22:00,485 --> 00:22:02,749
Look at that. I nearly forgot.

175
00:22:02,854 --> 00:22:05,448
Look here. Pelle, look.

176
00:22:05,557 --> 00:22:07,889
Look what I have.

177
00:22:07,993 --> 00:22:12,054
See, Pelle? I forgot that
I brought this from Sweden.

178
00:22:16,268 --> 00:22:19,396
From Tomelilla.

179
00:22:20,706 --> 00:22:23,300
Look.

180
00:22:23,408 --> 00:22:26,275
If we're lucky, Pelle,
we'll get wild strawberries.

181
00:22:32,351 --> 00:22:34,512
Just think, Pelle.

182
00:22:34,619 --> 00:22:36,985
Real Swedish strawberries.

183
00:22:51,503 --> 00:22:54,404
Nils, go and get some water
for your father.

184
00:23:43,288 --> 00:23:45,882
<i>Nils, how 'bout that water?</i>

185
00:23:53,064 --> 00:23:55,658
Look out over there!

186
00:24:02,541 --> 00:24:05,203
Just who do you think you are, Nils?

187
00:24:25,764 --> 00:24:29,097
Where have you been?
Your father's been looking for you.

188
00:24:29,201 --> 00:24:31,635
The missus sent me to the store.

189
00:25:19,084 --> 00:25:22,019
Let's see what you've got
under your jacket, Pelle.

190
00:25:29,628 --> 00:25:31,755
She said no one was to know.

191
00:25:35,400 --> 00:25:39,063
You're a good lad, Pelle. Come.

192
00:25:44,509 --> 00:25:47,740
If you give me the package,
I'll give it to my wife.

193
00:25:50,882 --> 00:25:53,112
No one else will see it.

194
00:26:03,662 --> 00:26:06,893
Hmm.</i>

195
00:26:06,998 --> 00:26:08,898
Cognac.

196
00:26:11,803 --> 00:26:13,703
It's mine.

197
00:26:23,815 --> 00:26:26,807
I won't budge from this place
until you give it to me.

198
00:26:31,723 --> 00:26:35,250
<i>You bastard, Kongstrup!</i>

199
00:26:35,360 --> 00:26:39,126
I said give me that bottle!
You Satan! You devil!

200
00:26:39,230 --> 00:26:43,963
<i>Pelle, go and tell them all</i>
<i>how he bullies me, how wicked he is!</i>

201
00:26:44,069 --> 00:26:48,506
- Tell them how he's ruining my life!
- It's all lies.

202
00:27:07,859 --> 00:27:09,827
You keep it.

203
00:27:25,310 --> 00:27:28,302
<i>God who keeps his children near...</i>

204
00:27:28,413 --> 00:27:30,711
<i>look at me who's kneeling here.</i>

205
00:27:30,815 --> 00:27:33,443
<i>My happiness is in God's hands...</i>

206
00:27:33,551 --> 00:27:36,816
whatever are the world's demands.

207
00:27:36,921 --> 00:27:39,151
- Papa?
- Yeah?

208
00:27:39,257 --> 00:27:41,851
Tomorrow, it's the day
after tomorrow.

209
00:27:43,361 --> 00:27:46,558
And the day after tomorrow,
it's tomorrow.

210
00:27:46,665 --> 00:27:49,327
My birthday.

211
00:27:49,434 --> 00:27:52,267
Yeah, yeah. Yeah, yeah.

212
00:27:56,007 --> 00:27:59,704
Pelle, was it the real thing
he threw out?

213
00:28:00,912 --> 00:28:02,880
Really cognac?

214
00:28:04,416 --> 00:28:07,351
He poured it into the flowerpot?

215
00:28:09,521 --> 00:28:12,046
<i>Happiness comes</i>
<i>and happiness goes.</i>

216
00:28:12,157 --> 00:28:16,423
<i>My happiness is in God's hands</i>
<i>whatever are the world's demands.</i>

217
00:28:42,387 --> 00:28:44,412
You ought to start grooming.

218
00:28:44,522 --> 00:28:46,615
Put a move on.

219
00:28:48,960 --> 00:28:51,622
Pants, Pelle. Pants first.

220
00:28:58,670 --> 00:29:01,036
But what about your pocket?

221
00:29:01,139 --> 00:29:04,939
<i>There's something in your pocket.</i>

222
00:29:05,043 --> 00:29:07,705
<i>You weren't out stealing</i>
<i>eggs last night, were you?</i>

223
00:29:09,981 --> 00:29:13,712
I'll be very surprised
if that egg isn't broken.

224
00:29:21,693 --> 00:29:23,820
Ohh, just a bunch of paper.

225
00:29:27,065 --> 00:29:29,932
I guess that's what they call
stuffing your pockets.

226
00:29:55,727 --> 00:29:58,662
It's your day--your birthday.

227
00:29:58,763 --> 00:30:00,663
- <i>God bless you, son.</i>
- Thank you.

228
00:30:05,637 --> 00:30:08,765
It's just a simple gift
from a poor man, Pelle.

229
00:30:40,839 --> 00:30:42,807
<i>Look.</i>

230
00:30:43,842 --> 00:30:46,402
Well, well. A real beauty.

231
00:30:48,847 --> 00:30:51,145
<i>It's a birthday present.</i>

232
00:30:52,650 --> 00:30:54,880
Yeah, I should have known
straight away.

233
00:30:54,986 --> 00:30:57,750
You really look like someone
who is having his birthday.

234
00:30:57,856 --> 00:31:00,586
Congratulations.

235
00:31:00,692 --> 00:31:04,287
Happy birthday. It's your day.

236
00:31:13,771 --> 00:31:18,367
They say-- They say that
you plan to run away to America.

237
00:31:20,245 --> 00:31:24,443
What? Run away?

238
00:31:24,549 --> 00:31:28,679
<i>Do you take me for an idiot?</i>
<i>Do you really think I'd risk all I've worked for...</i>

239
00:31:28,786 --> 00:31:31,516
all my savings
and be a hunted outlaw, do ya?

240
00:31:31,623 --> 00:31:35,286
Oh, no. I wanna be free, Pelle.

241
00:31:35,393 --> 00:31:38,260
<i>A free man.</i>
<i>That's what I'm waiting for.</i>

242
00:31:38,363 --> 00:31:41,423
That's what I want--

243
00:31:41,532 --> 00:31:43,625
to be free.

244
00:32:04,322 --> 00:32:07,018
Pelle?

245
00:32:07,125 --> 00:32:10,185
I wanna show you something.

246
00:32:10,295 --> 00:32:12,320
It's here.

247
00:32:14,999 --> 00:32:16,899
Here.

248
00:32:17,001 --> 00:32:19,697
This is the boat to America.

249
00:32:19,804 --> 00:32:22,739
I've got only two years left
to work on this damn farm.

250
00:32:22,840 --> 00:32:25,331
That's all, two years.

251
00:32:25,443 --> 00:32:27,968
Then I'll have enough money
for my ticket.

252
00:32:28,079 --> 00:32:31,048
As soon as the manager
pays out all my money...

253
00:32:31,149 --> 00:32:34,585
then I'm going out
to conquer the world...

254
00:32:34,686 --> 00:32:37,814
over the great ocean, huh?

255
00:32:37,922 --> 00:32:40,356
First America, then China...

256
00:32:40,458 --> 00:32:42,449
Spain, Australia.

257
00:32:42,560 --> 00:32:45,461
It's out there.
It'll be mine to conquer.

258
00:32:45,563 --> 00:32:49,055
It's all out there
just waiting to be conquered.

259
00:32:49,167 --> 00:32:51,635
A man can actually live.

260
00:32:51,736 --> 00:32:55,672
- It's out there waiting for us.
- Take me with ya.

261
00:32:57,342 --> 00:32:59,242
Yeah.

262
00:32:59,344 --> 00:33:03,576
Because today is-- today is--
today is your birthday.

263
00:33:03,681 --> 00:33:05,842
Remember, in two years...

264
00:33:05,950 --> 00:33:10,284
when the snow begins to melt,
we, too, will sail to America.

265
00:33:12,023 --> 00:33:15,891
You and me will set out to conquer...

266
00:33:15,994 --> 00:33:19,691
that great, rich, wonderful world.

267
00:33:57,902 --> 00:34:01,269
Open. Surprise.

268
00:34:04,142 --> 00:34:08,875
We've eaten wild strawberries
on all your birthdays.

269
00:34:08,980 --> 00:34:12,347
<i>Just think,</i>
<i>real Swedish wild strawberries.</i>

270
00:34:14,552 --> 00:34:17,282
How far is it to America, Papa?

271
00:34:18,890 --> 00:34:20,881
America?

272
00:34:22,260 --> 00:34:24,455
Uh, that's a long way.

273
00:34:24,562 --> 00:34:27,224
You have to cross
a whole ocean, Pelle.

274
00:34:27,331 --> 00:34:30,892
Erik says that he wants
to sail there first.

275
00:34:33,171 --> 00:34:36,470
He told me
it's the strongest thing there is.

276
00:34:36,574 --> 00:34:39,543
It's soft, but it can
hold up anything.

277
00:34:40,912 --> 00:34:42,812
Yeah?

278
00:34:42,914 --> 00:34:45,041
I wonder...

279
00:34:45,149 --> 00:34:47,811
America and China...

280
00:34:49,420 --> 00:34:52,878
are they made something
like a boat?

281
00:34:52,990 --> 00:34:55,185
It seems impossible.

282
00:34:56,627 --> 00:34:58,595
Are those countries drifting...

283
00:34:58,696 --> 00:35:02,063
or are they anchored
to the bottom?

284
00:35:03,768 --> 00:35:06,828
Well, the two are anchored
more than likely.

285
00:36:55,179 --> 00:36:57,374
<i>Kongstrup!</i>

286
00:36:57,481 --> 00:36:59,449
<i>Kongstrup!</i>

287
00:37:01,185 --> 00:37:05,178
- <i>Come out, Kongstrup! I wanna talk to you!</i>

288
00:37:05,289 --> 00:37:08,019
Your son is hungry, Kongstrup!

289
00:37:08,125 --> 00:37:11,094
<i>It's the sow and her cabbage head kid.</i>

290
00:37:12,797 --> 00:37:16,096
Kongstrup, come back.
Your son needs money for food! Do you hear?

291
00:37:16,200 --> 00:37:19,101
<i>Where do you think</i>
<i>you're going, you cabbage head?</i>

292
00:37:19,203 --> 00:37:23,697
We have to talk to your father! Kongstrup,
come say hello to your bastard son. He's hungry!

293
00:37:23,808 --> 00:37:27,300
<i>That dirty lecher has kids all over the place.</i>

294
00:37:27,411 --> 00:37:30,642
- <i>Kongstrup!</i>
- <i>Except with his missus, that is.</i>

295
00:37:30,748 --> 00:37:33,581
- <i>Your son is hungry!</i>
- Some say she's good at hexes.

296
00:37:33,684 --> 00:37:36,812
The monthly allowance for your bastard son!
Do you have so many you forgot?

297
00:37:36,921 --> 00:37:39,981
Get out, you slattern. Didn't I tell you
not to come here? Get out!

298
00:37:40,091 --> 00:37:42,286
- <i>Out!</i>
- <i>The boy has a right to see his father!</i>

299
00:37:42,393 --> 00:37:44,827
<i>Get out, you disgusting sow!</i>

300
00:37:44,929 --> 00:37:47,659
<i>Kongstrup has to pay</i>
<i>for his lechery!</i>

301
00:37:47,765 --> 00:37:52,395
-<i>Kongstrup, you'll never be rid of your son!</i>
- Out, and stay out!

302
00:37:52,503 --> 00:37:54,937
<i>You'll never be rid of us!</i>

303
00:37:57,508 --> 00:37:59,408
Whoa.

304
00:38:13,858 --> 00:38:17,692
<i>Kongstrup. Kongstrup!</i>

305
00:38:44,188 --> 00:38:47,749
Take good care of your slate now,
Pelle, so it doesn't get broken.

306
00:38:47,858 --> 00:38:50,986
And stay out of the way of the big boys
until you can handle them.

307
00:38:51,095 --> 00:38:53,427
But if they won't leave you alone...

308
00:38:53,531 --> 00:38:57,399
the way you handle it is you have
to be the one who hits first, Pelle.

309
00:38:57,501 --> 00:39:01,767
But when you hit,
be sure to hit hard.

310
00:39:01,872 --> 00:39:04,602
You must pay attention
to everything the teacher says.

311
00:39:04,709 --> 00:39:07,041
Don't make trouble.

312
00:39:07,144 --> 00:39:10,113
And when you blow your nose,
use a handkerchief.

313
00:39:10,214 --> 00:39:12,910
Don't use your fingers,
whatever you do.

314
00:39:13,017 --> 00:39:15,451
But if you're sure
that no one is looking...

315
00:39:15,553 --> 00:39:19,751
then naturally it would make sense
to save the handkerchief.

316
00:39:19,857 --> 00:39:22,690
You take care of that sweater
now that I have mended it, huh?

317
00:39:22,793 --> 00:39:25,125
And should the teacher's wife
invite you for coffee...

318
00:39:25,229 --> 00:39:27,993
take only one piece
of cake, Pelle, remember?

319
00:39:28,099 --> 00:39:30,590
- She's not gonna do it.
- And why?

320
00:39:30,701 --> 00:39:33,693
'Cause the teacher
hasn't got a wife.

321
00:39:33,804 --> 00:39:36,534
- That's right. That's the bell now.

322
00:39:36,640 --> 00:39:38,665
Go on.

323
00:39:40,478 --> 00:39:42,673
B-A says ba.

324
00:39:42,780 --> 00:39:45,749
B-E says be.

325
00:39:45,850 --> 00:39:50,514
B-A says ba.

326
00:39:50,621 --> 00:39:54,990
B-E says be.

327
00:39:55,092 --> 00:39:58,789
B-I says bi.

328
00:39:58,896 --> 00:40:01,387
B-O says bo.

329
00:40:01,499 --> 00:40:05,595
B-U says bu.

330
00:40:05,703 --> 00:40:09,901
B-Y says by.

331
00:40:10,007 --> 00:40:13,773
B-A-A says " baa-aa-aa."

332
00:40:13,878 --> 00:40:18,178
You miserable brats!
Stop it! Stop it at once, I say!

333
00:40:18,282 --> 00:40:21,445
<i>I'll give each and every one of you</i>
<i>a good thrashing! Silence!</i>

334
00:40:21,552 --> 00:40:24,578
<i>Silence in this classroom!</i>

335
00:40:30,895 --> 00:40:33,125
Silence. Silence!

336
00:40:33,230 --> 00:40:36,131
<i>You little barbarians.</i>

337
00:40:39,937 --> 00:40:43,134
We have here a new boy.

338
00:40:43,240 --> 00:40:45,401
<i>We must welcome him to our class.</i>

339
00:40:48,412 --> 00:40:50,346
Stand up...

340
00:40:51,415 --> 00:40:53,440
and tell us your name.

341
00:40:53,551 --> 00:40:56,452
- Pelle Karlsson.
- Mm-hmm.

342
00:40:56,554 --> 00:40:59,614
And what are you good at?

343
00:40:59,723 --> 00:41:05,025
- I can make a cow obey me
just by throwing stones at her.
- <i>Listen, Mr. Hayseed.</i>

344
00:41:05,129 --> 00:41:08,860
- I can get the cows to stand
still when I buzz like a wasp.
- <i>Swedish clod.</i>

345
00:41:08,966 --> 00:41:11,764
- I can tell time by using the sun.
- Can you read?

346
00:41:11,869 --> 00:41:13,996
No. Reading's why I come here.

347
00:41:16,173 --> 00:41:19,472
I don't care for your insolence
and sarcasm.

348
00:41:20,811 --> 00:41:23,507
B-A says ba.

349
00:41:23,614 --> 00:41:26,640
B-E says be.

350
00:41:26,750 --> 00:41:30,208
B-I says bi.

351
00:41:32,056 --> 00:41:36,288
This one here, you told me
but I forgot. What do you call it?

352
00:41:36,393 --> 00:41:39,123
<i>Papa, you mean</i>
<i>you've forgotten already?</i>

353
00:41:39,230 --> 00:41:42,222
I could remember
after seeing it only once.

354
00:41:42,333 --> 00:41:44,494
It's an " F."

355
00:41:44,602 --> 00:41:47,833
<i>Yeah. An "F"is exactly what it is.</i>

356
00:41:47,938 --> 00:41:49,838
I don't know what's wrong
with my head today.

357
00:41:49,940 --> 00:41:53,000
<i>"F. " "F!"</i>

358
00:41:53,110 --> 00:41:55,408
<i>What do you think it's used for?</i>

359
00:41:57,314 --> 00:42:00,841
It's the first letter in "afternoon."
F-ternoon, Papa.

360
00:42:00,951 --> 00:42:03,476
Yeah, that's right.

361
00:42:03,587 --> 00:42:07,421
Only you couldn't have figured that out alone.
Your teacher must have told you.

362
00:42:07,525 --> 00:42:10,494
No, I figured it out myself.

363
00:42:10,594 --> 00:42:15,122
Is that so?
You're getting so smart, Pelle.

364
00:42:15,232 --> 00:42:19,692
I tell you, there's no end to what a boy
with such book learning can do.

365
00:43:45,089 --> 00:43:47,683
Maybe a pork roast, Pelle.

366
00:43:47,791 --> 00:43:50,760
Pork roast with raisins.

367
00:43:50,861 --> 00:43:54,558
Or with apples.
They also make it with apples...

368
00:43:54,665 --> 00:43:58,192
instead of with raisins.

369
00:43:58,302 --> 00:44:01,669
Yeah, we'll see. We'll see.

370
00:44:04,274 --> 00:44:06,174
<i>Get out!</i>

371
00:44:06,276 --> 00:44:09,473
I don't want any more
trouble from you. Move!

372
00:44:09,580 --> 00:44:13,983
Herring! Herring on Christmas eve.
I didn't expect that, even from you!

373
00:44:14,084 --> 00:44:16,678
If you don't like the food,
then find some other place!

374
00:44:16,787 --> 00:44:18,948
It would be a pleasure
to see the last of you!

375
00:44:19,056 --> 00:44:23,117
Herring every single day. Couldn't we
have had roast pork for Christmas?

376
00:44:23,227 --> 00:44:26,754
- A real Christmas dinner? Herring!
- You're always complaining!

377
00:44:26,864 --> 00:44:30,857
If you don't like it in this country,
go back to Sweden!

378
00:44:30,968 --> 00:44:34,028
What right do you have
to be so damn stingy?

379
00:44:34,138 --> 00:44:36,333
Don't you think we work
hard enough for our food?

380
00:44:36,440 --> 00:44:39,307
You of all people say that to me,
you lazy dog!

381
00:44:39,410 --> 00:44:42,902
- <i>Go to your quarters!</i>
- To hell!

382
00:44:43,013 --> 00:44:45,208
To hell with you!

383
00:44:46,417 --> 00:44:49,648
To hell with your farm!

384
00:44:49,753 --> 00:44:52,278
To hell with you and your farm!

385
00:44:52,389 --> 00:44:54,448
<i>To hell!</i>

386
00:44:58,095 --> 00:45:00,325
Any other complaints here?

387
00:47:44,795 --> 00:47:46,956
Who asked you to look?

388
00:47:47,064 --> 00:47:49,828
Yeah, you little sissy. Why don't you
go back to where you came from?

389
00:47:49,933 --> 00:47:51,833
<i>Yellow-bellied Swede.</i>

390
00:47:51,935 --> 00:47:54,904
<i>Why don't you just stay with your own kind?</i>

391
00:48:14,925 --> 00:48:18,884
Get lost, Pelle.
You might slip and fall in the icy water.

392
00:48:22,165 --> 00:48:24,793
<i>Go home, Pelle.</i>

393
00:48:26,470 --> 00:48:30,429
- <i>We don't like yellow bellies.</i>
- <i>So quit following us around.</i>

394
00:48:37,080 --> 00:48:40,140
- <i>Go on home to your mama.</i>
- I can't. My mama is dead!

395
00:48:40,250 --> 00:48:43,378
- <i>Can you prove you're not a yellow belly?</i>
- Yeah. I'll jump in that water!

396
00:49:55,826 --> 00:50:00,058
You must be crazy, jumping in the water
like-- like some...

397
00:50:00,163 --> 00:50:03,155
lovesick woman....

398
00:50:03,266 --> 00:50:05,598
just to show those kids.

399
00:50:05,702 --> 00:50:09,229
A good beating is
what you deserve, Pelle.

400
00:50:09,339 --> 00:50:11,330
It's a good thing you didn't drown.

401
00:50:11,441 --> 00:50:14,467
I'd have given you such a beating
you wouldn't have sit down for a month.

402
00:50:14,578 --> 00:50:17,308
Because if you had drowned
it would have been your fault.

403
00:50:17,414 --> 00:50:20,872
Doctor?

404
00:50:20,984 --> 00:50:25,284
You can-- You can use this
if you want to take some blood.

405
00:50:40,537 --> 00:50:42,528
Drink this.

406
00:50:42,639 --> 00:50:45,130
It will help your cold.

407
00:50:51,348 --> 00:50:55,648
Don't be afraid of me, Pelle.
I'm not a witch.

408
00:50:57,254 --> 00:51:00,746
Just very... lonely at times.

409
00:51:03,827 --> 00:51:05,852
Oh, dear God.

410
00:51:07,764 --> 00:51:10,426
You don't even have a mother...

411
00:51:10,534 --> 00:51:12,559
do you?

412
00:51:12,669 --> 00:51:15,103
It's three years since Mama died.

413
00:51:16,406 --> 00:51:19,569
She's in the left-hand side
of the churchyard.

414
00:51:20,677 --> 00:51:23,111
Do you think of her much?

415
00:51:25,715 --> 00:51:27,842
Lasse sews my clothes.

416
00:51:28,985 --> 00:51:31,453
She was a good mother, wasn't she?

417
00:51:33,757 --> 00:51:36,920
She was so sick
and grouchy at the end.

418
00:51:37,027 --> 00:51:39,393
And she used to be so happy.

419
00:51:40,697 --> 00:51:43,165
But we'll get hitched again...

420
00:51:43,266 --> 00:51:46,463
if Lasse can find someone
who will have him.

421
00:51:47,804 --> 00:51:50,034
And then you'll go away.

422
00:51:52,909 --> 00:51:55,469
The workers all hate it here.

423
00:51:56,646 --> 00:52:00,082
It's as though
it were godforsaken.

424
00:52:00,183 --> 00:52:02,344
As if it were cursed.

425
00:52:03,386 --> 00:52:06,355
The earth is bloody.

426
00:52:06,456 --> 00:52:09,220
They say that?

427
00:52:09,326 --> 00:52:11,351
Yeah.

428
00:52:13,230 --> 00:52:15,698
And when they talk about me?

429
00:52:17,067 --> 00:52:19,365
They say you have a pact
with the devil...

430
00:52:19,469 --> 00:52:22,199
and you turn into
a werewolf at night.

431
00:52:25,642 --> 00:52:27,940
It's the price you pay...

432
00:52:28,044 --> 00:52:31,013
yielding your heart
to the wrong man.

433
00:52:35,685 --> 00:52:38,552
If he knew the anguish...

434
00:52:38,655 --> 00:52:40,714
the suffering that he causes
with his lechery.

435
00:52:43,293 --> 00:52:46,820
<i>He's in town at this very moment.</i>
<i>Why does he do this to me?</i>

436
00:52:46,930 --> 00:52:51,196
<i>I married him, made him</i>
<i>a property owner, gave him my love...</i>

437
00:52:51,301 --> 00:52:54,168
<i>the best I have I've given him,</i>
<i>if only he could have given me a child.</i>

438
00:52:54,271 --> 00:52:58,139
- I really have to go.
- Oh, you're afraid of me again.

439
00:53:01,678 --> 00:53:03,976
You're a good boy, Pelle.

440
00:53:05,749 --> 00:53:07,808
If I had a son...

441
00:53:07,918 --> 00:53:11,149
he would... be like you.

442
00:54:06,643 --> 00:54:08,668
Come.

443
00:54:26,196 --> 00:54:30,223
<i>And this is where</i>
<i>we keep our cows.</i>

444
00:54:30,333 --> 00:54:34,064
<i>Papa, it's the missus.</i>
<i>It's the missus with the young lady.</i>

445
00:54:34,170 --> 00:54:38,573
Oh, damn it. Pelle, go forward.

446
00:54:38,675 --> 00:54:40,700
Go forward.

447
00:54:43,713 --> 00:54:47,114
- Pelle, where's your father?

448
00:54:53,089 --> 00:54:57,116
<i>This is our cattleman</i>
<i>Lasse Karlsson and his son Pelle.</i>

449
00:54:57,227 --> 00:54:59,195
Hello.

450
00:55:01,431 --> 00:55:04,195
And this is Miss Signe...

451
00:55:04,301 --> 00:55:06,292
my niece from Copenhagen.

452
00:55:06,403 --> 00:55:08,997
- She will be staying with us now.
- Yep.

453
00:55:43,573 --> 00:55:45,803
I've forgotten what two times two are.

454
00:55:48,011 --> 00:55:50,309
I may be a bit rusty on the subject...

455
00:55:50,413 --> 00:55:54,110
<i>but I think the answer</i>
<i>is the same as in addition.</i>

456
00:55:54,217 --> 00:55:56,515
Two and two are five.

457
00:56:02,125 --> 00:56:04,787
What's lighter--
a ton of feathers...

458
00:56:04,894 --> 00:56:07,021
<i>or a ton of lead?</i></i>

459
00:56:07,130 --> 00:56:10,361
- <i>Oh, now you.</i>
- Sit down.

460
00:56:10,467 --> 00:56:14,563
<i>if you don't mind, I would like to hear</i>
<i>that question again, Pelle.</i>

461
00:56:14,671 --> 00:56:16,662
Repeat it, please.

462
00:56:16,773 --> 00:56:20,436
Which is lighter--
a ton of feathers or a ton of lead?

463
00:57:16,032 --> 00:57:18,330
<i>Well, well, what have we here?</i>

464
00:57:20,570 --> 00:57:22,470
And where's the herring?

465
00:57:22,572 --> 00:57:25,234
I eat nothing but herring!</i>

466
00:57:25,341 --> 00:57:27,741
<i>Herring, please!</i></i>

467
00:57:27,844 --> 00:57:30,745
- Do you know what the difference
is between you and an ox?
- No.

468
00:57:30,847 --> 00:57:35,443
No? I don't know either.

469
00:57:38,021 --> 00:57:39,921
Erik, did you hear my joke?

470
00:57:40,023 --> 00:57:42,048
- I asked him--
- I ask you for a favor, Lasse.

471
00:57:42,158 --> 00:57:45,252
Could you take my place
tonight at the thresher?

472
00:57:45,361 --> 00:57:49,263
- But it's Saturday.
- Yeah, but I want to get a bit of, you know--

473
00:57:49,365 --> 00:57:51,265
- Will ya?
- Yeah, yeah.

474
00:57:51,367 --> 00:57:53,426
No, no, not so fast.

475
00:57:57,307 --> 00:57:59,298
Mm-mmm.

476
00:58:00,610 --> 00:58:03,511
<i>He's got a way with women.</i>
<i>Takes after his father.</i>

477
00:58:03,613 --> 00:58:07,379
<i>Must have been a hell</i>
<i>of a long time ago, Karlsson.</i>

478
00:58:07,484 --> 00:58:09,918
A real good idea, Karna.

479
00:58:10,019 --> 00:58:13,750
You and me. You do like Pelle.

480
00:58:13,857 --> 00:58:16,052
You're always good to the boy.

481
00:58:16,159 --> 00:58:18,389
The three of us staying together.

482
00:58:18,495 --> 00:58:21,464
I bet we'd be real happy.

483
00:58:21,564 --> 00:58:25,796
You're too old, Lasse.
For me, the man has to be dangerous.

484
00:58:25,902 --> 00:58:28,166
You're not dangerous anymore.

485
00:58:28,271 --> 00:58:32,640
I see. I'm sorry.

486
00:58:32,742 --> 00:58:36,007
So, you're fishing for a young one?

487
00:58:36,112 --> 00:58:39,206
You could end up missing
the boat altogether.

488
00:58:39,315 --> 00:58:41,545
I don't believe it.
It's empty already.

489
00:58:41,651 --> 00:58:46,281
- Hey, Lasse. Do us a favor!
- Yeah, Lasse. Run down and
get us some more brandy.

490
00:58:46,389 --> 00:58:49,756
If you want brandy,
you can go and get it.

491
00:58:49,859 --> 00:58:53,317
Just because someone is old--
There used to be respect!

492
00:58:53,429 --> 00:58:58,162
"Lasse," the girls would say.
"I want Lasse Karlsson."

493
00:58:58,268 --> 00:59:01,260
<i>Even though you were married,</i>
<i>the girls were chasing you.</i>

494
00:59:01,371 --> 00:59:03,271
And there was respect.

495
00:59:11,114 --> 00:59:13,082
Papa!

496
00:59:15,885 --> 00:59:17,785
I'm sorry.

497
00:59:17,887 --> 00:59:22,187
Yeah, I had hoped, when we left Sweden,
that there would be...

498
00:59:22,292 --> 00:59:25,955
some money left over,
enough to buy a little house.

499
00:59:27,063 --> 00:59:29,429
Then I could find
the right lady to--

500
00:59:29,532 --> 00:59:33,593
to take care of us.

501
00:59:33,703 --> 00:59:37,730
We could have had coffee under the sheets
some Sunday morning, Pelle.

502
00:59:37,840 --> 00:59:40,240
What if we were to run?

503
00:59:40,343 --> 00:59:42,277
Run to somewhere far?

504
00:59:42,378 --> 00:59:46,144
Run away? Uh, but think
of the authorities.

505
00:59:46,249 --> 00:59:49,480
- I don't want to become an outlaw.
- I mean, all the way...

506
00:59:49,586 --> 00:59:51,486
- to America!
- America!

507
00:59:51,588 --> 00:59:54,523
Voyage to America, across the ocean!

508
00:59:54,624 --> 00:59:57,320
They don't follow anybody that far.

509
01:00:00,697 --> 01:00:03,063
We'll get away.

510
01:00:28,758 --> 01:00:31,522
<i>What are you doing?</i>

511
01:00:37,233 --> 01:00:40,999
- <i>Stealing eggs. I was hungry.</i>
- For God's sake, tell no one you saw me.

512
01:00:47,744 --> 01:00:49,871
<i>I know who the father is.</i>

513
01:01:07,964 --> 01:01:10,956
You've got to swear
that you'll tell no one.

514
01:01:13,269 --> 01:01:15,965
His father--

515
01:01:16,072 --> 01:01:19,769
If he found out,
I don't know what he would--

516
01:01:19,876 --> 01:01:23,312
And to his father,
a Swedish woman...

517
01:01:23,413 --> 01:01:26,211
an immigrant worker, is--

518
01:01:26,315 --> 01:01:29,546
For the love of God,
you're not going to tell anyone?

519
01:01:29,652 --> 01:01:31,984
<i>I've got to hide in here</i>
<i>until my time comes.</i>

520
01:01:32,088 --> 01:01:34,318
Understand?

521
01:01:45,702 --> 01:01:47,260
Pelle!

522
01:01:50,139 --> 01:01:52,107
Come here!

523
01:01:54,977 --> 01:01:56,877
<i>What were you doing</i>
<i>in the hen-house?</i>

524
01:01:56,979 --> 01:02:00,107
- Stealing eggs.
- Come.

525
01:02:00,216 --> 01:02:02,116
Bend.

526
01:02:49,198 --> 01:02:51,098
Pelle, can I have that coin?

527
01:02:51,200 --> 01:02:54,226
My krone?
You're really out of your head.

528
01:02:54,337 --> 01:02:57,602
I need it for when I go to America.

529
01:02:57,707 --> 01:03:01,575
I'll pay you two kroners
for it when I'm big and grown.

530
01:03:01,677 --> 01:03:05,477
You're not gonna grow.
Your body's unnatural.

531
01:03:07,450 --> 01:03:10,851
I could be real popular
in a circus or a carnival.

532
01:03:12,421 --> 01:03:14,981
- A carnival?
- Yes, as a monster.

533
01:03:15,091 --> 01:03:17,525
I'll get filthy rich.

534
01:03:23,032 --> 01:03:27,662
What about-- What about if I let you beat me
with nettles a hundred times?

535
01:03:27,770 --> 01:03:30,534
A hundred good ones.
How would that be?

536
01:03:31,674 --> 01:03:33,767
Me beat you?

537
01:03:33,876 --> 01:03:37,835
- What do you say?
- You couldn't take it.

538
01:03:37,947 --> 01:03:39,938
Is it a deal?

539
01:03:49,025 --> 01:03:51,255
Are you ready?

540
01:04:08,744 --> 01:04:11,406
No more!

541
01:04:13,115 --> 01:04:17,211
- <i>No more!</i>
- If you don't wanna get paid--

542
01:04:17,320 --> 01:04:20,653
<i>You hit too hard.</i>

543
01:04:20,756 --> 01:04:23,919
- Well, make up your mind.
- The money first.

544
01:05:23,352 --> 01:05:27,118
<i>Can you tell us anything about</i>
<i>Adam and Eve and the serpent?</i>

545
01:05:29,325 --> 01:05:33,489
<i>Well? We're all waiting.</i>

546
01:05:34,897 --> 01:05:38,060
Have you never heard
of Adam and Eve and the serpent?

547
01:05:42,305 --> 01:05:46,469
<i>Haven't you been listening in class?</i>

548
01:05:46,575 --> 01:05:50,170
<i>What did the serpent promise</i>
<i>Adam and Eve if they disobeyed God...</i>

549
01:05:50,279 --> 01:05:52,975
and ate of the forbidden fruit?

550
01:05:56,919 --> 01:05:59,217
<i>You don't know what</i>
<i>the serpent promised them.</i>

551
01:06:00,690 --> 01:06:03,989
The snake in the garden
convinced them that they would--

552
01:06:04,093 --> 01:06:07,790
would indeed be equal
to Almighty God.

553
01:06:07,897 --> 01:06:10,365
I do not see how we can let you
continue in this class...

554
01:06:10,466 --> 01:06:14,596
when it is clear that you
do not understand the basic tenets.

555
01:06:14,704 --> 01:06:16,899
<i>Are his parents here?</i>

556
01:06:23,312 --> 01:06:26,008
<i>His parents are not in attendance.</i>

557
01:06:26,115 --> 01:06:28,640
<i>You may take your seat.</i>

558
01:06:28,751 --> 01:06:32,209
- <i>Next.</i>
- <i>Pelle.</i>

559
01:06:40,096 --> 01:06:44,396
<i>Perhaps you can tell us</i>
<i>what God said to the serpent.</i>

560
01:06:44,500 --> 01:06:47,128
Our Lord said that--

561
01:06:47,236 --> 01:06:49,204
that--

562
01:06:51,474 --> 01:06:56,173
God said that the serpent
must crawl on its belly.

563
01:06:56,278 --> 01:06:59,475
<i>"Thou shalt crawl on thy belly. "</i>

564
01:07:02,685 --> 01:07:05,279
- <i>And does it still do so?</i>
- Yes.

565
01:07:05,388 --> 01:07:09,552
- It hasn't any limbs.
- <i>And can you tell me what a limb is?</i>

566
01:07:09,658 --> 01:07:12,525
A limb is, uh--

567
01:07:14,597 --> 01:07:17,760
- A hand, for example.
- <i>Mm-hmm. Very good.</i>

568
01:07:17,867 --> 01:07:22,634
<i>And can you tells us what distinguishes</i>
<i>all limbs from other parts of the body?</i>

569
01:07:27,376 --> 01:07:30,937
<i>A limb moves independently</i>
<i>from the rest of the body.</i>

570
01:07:32,348 --> 01:07:35,613
Can you provide the others
in the class with an example?

571
01:07:44,160 --> 01:07:45,889
Ears?

572
01:07:46,862 --> 01:07:49,524
<i>Oh? Can you move your ears?</i>

573
01:07:49,632 --> 01:07:53,500
- Yeah.
- <i>I should really like to see that.</i>

574
01:08:10,653 --> 01:08:12,780
You see, it was
your ears that saved you.

575
01:08:12,888 --> 01:08:15,186
I always told you
to use your ears.

576
01:08:26,202 --> 01:08:28,170
Rud!

577
01:08:29,905 --> 01:08:33,773
Rud! Rud!

578
01:08:34,910 --> 01:08:37,743
Rud, you idiot! Come back!

579
01:08:40,015 --> 01:08:42,984
You'll never go to heaven!

580
01:08:43,085 --> 01:08:45,918
<i>You'll never see</i>
<i>your grandma in heaven!</i>

581
01:08:51,460 --> 01:08:54,554
You can have my knife
if you come back!

582
01:09:03,672 --> 01:09:06,072
You can't do this, Rud!

583
01:09:07,376 --> 01:09:09,276
No! No!

584
01:09:11,814 --> 01:09:14,044
Rud!

585
01:09:30,432 --> 01:09:32,866
Anna!

586
01:10:55,951 --> 01:10:58,078
Don't touch those stones!

587
01:11:00,289 --> 01:11:05,454
Your infant is lying there,
buried in the bloody earth under the stone.

588
01:11:05,561 --> 01:11:10,362
<i>Yes, he is! Anna killed your child,</i>
<i>and now she's in prison.</i>

589
01:11:14,336 --> 01:11:17,169
<i>The crime is on my soul.</i>

590
01:11:19,408 --> 01:11:22,002
<i>I</i> murdered the child.

591
01:11:25,514 --> 01:11:28,449
Natural fathers wouldn't do that.

592
01:11:28,550 --> 01:11:31,417
<i>Lasse would never</i>
<i>have done that to me.</i>

593
01:11:36,592 --> 01:11:39,618
Why don't you go away
and leave me be?

594
01:11:39,728 --> 01:11:42,754
I see him at night!
A bonfire, you can see for miles!

595
01:11:42,865 --> 01:11:45,299
<i>His soul burns</i>
<i>on the rocks at night.</i>

596
01:11:45,401 --> 01:11:47,301
You mustn't say that!

597
01:11:47,403 --> 01:11:49,394
You mustn't lie
in front of God!

598
01:11:49,505 --> 01:11:51,905
The boy is lying up in the churchyard
in consecrated ground.

599
01:11:52,007 --> 01:11:54,100
<i>His soul is not up there.</i>
<i>It's under the rocks.</i>

600
01:11:54,209 --> 01:11:56,473
Come see at midnight,
see him burn!

601
01:11:56,578 --> 01:11:58,478
And the reason is
he got baptized too late.

602
01:11:58,580 --> 01:12:02,448
<i>God won't let him into heaven!</i>

603
01:12:33,315 --> 01:12:35,283
<i>Nils!</i>

604
01:13:09,218 --> 01:13:12,187
Who has gone out there
into the arms of death?

605
01:13:12,287 --> 01:13:15,256
<i>It's Nils. He went out with the line.</i>

606
01:13:40,849 --> 01:13:44,046
<i>Hold steady! Take her around!</i>

607
01:14:21,190 --> 01:14:23,522
Let's get him over there!

608
01:15:34,162 --> 01:15:37,962
With your young eyes,
can you see Nils?

609
01:15:49,978 --> 01:15:53,209
♪ <i>Blessed is the Earth</i> ♪

610
01:15:53,315 --> 01:15:56,409
♪  Blessed is our Lord in Heaven ♪

611
01:15:56,518 --> 01:16:00,614
♪ And so, it's the angels ♪

612
01:16:30,052 --> 01:16:32,885
He was a good son.

613
01:16:32,988 --> 01:16:35,047
Did everything for me.

614
01:16:36,258 --> 01:16:39,625
He was... a fine boy.

615
01:16:40,896 --> 01:16:43,888
Not an evil word did he
ever say to me.

616
01:16:43,999 --> 01:16:45,899
<i>Not once.</i>

617
01:16:46,001 --> 01:16:48,333
<i>Even though I denied him his love...</i>

618
01:16:50,639 --> 01:16:52,971
<i>he was my son.</i>

619
01:16:54,409 --> 01:16:56,969
And my only one.

620
01:17:08,557 --> 01:17:13,426
<i>May he find peace now.</i>
<i>He had so little of it here on Earth.</i>

621
01:17:17,132 --> 01:17:21,193
He sacrificed his life to save others.

622
01:17:21,303 --> 01:17:25,740
Perhaps now, in heaven,
he'll be welcome.

623
01:17:39,788 --> 01:17:43,053
<i>Come on, Erik!</i></i>

624
01:17:43,158 --> 01:17:46,821
Only a couple inches more
and you win the brandy!

625
01:17:54,803 --> 01:17:56,703
- <i>He won the brandy!</i>

626
01:17:56,805 --> 01:17:59,467
<i>When will you drink it?</i>
<i>The foreman says you have to work tonight!</i>

627
01:17:59,574 --> 01:18:02,737
Listen, tonight I don't work.
He'll do it without Erik.

628
01:18:02,844 --> 01:18:04,744
I'm goin' out
and have some fun.

629
01:18:04,846 --> 01:18:09,977
- - <i>That foreman can't keep me in</i>
<i>when I feel like havin' fun.</i>

630
01:18:10,085 --> 01:18:13,418
- Can I come with you?
- No.

631
01:18:13,522 --> 01:18:15,490
Not now, Pelle.

632
01:18:16,525 --> 01:18:19,323
Not now. In one year.

633
01:18:19,428 --> 01:18:22,795
We can cross the ocean
when the snow starts to melt.

634
01:18:22,898 --> 01:18:26,095
The two of us go out
into the great world.

635
01:18:26,201 --> 01:18:30,069
First America, then Australia...

636
01:18:30,172 --> 01:18:32,868
then China!

637
01:18:32,974 --> 01:18:36,102
Out there's a whole world, Pelle!

638
01:18:51,860 --> 01:18:53,760
<i>Where do you think</i>
<i>you're going, you lazy</i>--

639
01:18:53,862 --> 01:18:56,456
<i>They said there was work</i>
<i>for you at the supper! Erik!</i>

640
01:19:00,435 --> 01:19:03,427
You had to hear.
What do you call this?

641
01:19:03,538 --> 01:19:07,201
I must have the flu.
Head's spinnin' like a top!

642
01:19:07,309 --> 01:19:11,143
That sounds serious.
We'd better have a look at you.

643
01:19:11,246 --> 01:19:14,545
Well, well, look at this.
All dressed up in your Sunday clothes.

644
01:19:14,649 --> 01:19:17,482
What is it, your burial outfit?

645
01:19:17,586 --> 01:19:19,918
<i>Were you going out to</i>
<i>buy yourself a grave?</i>

646
01:19:20,021 --> 01:19:22,581
It's about time we got
you into the ground.

647
01:19:22,691 --> 01:19:25,785
You're already beginning to smell.

648
01:19:25,894 --> 01:19:28,158
I ain't dead yet.

649
01:19:28,263 --> 01:19:32,165
And I don't smell any worse
than some people I know.

650
01:19:34,336 --> 01:19:38,067
You're nothing but a lazy,
complaining troublemaker!

651
01:19:38,173 --> 01:19:39,936
- And I'm sick of you!
- Go ahead. Do it again.

652
01:19:40,041 --> 01:19:43,101
- Sick of you bellyaching!
- Go on. Hit me again...

653
01:19:43,211 --> 01:19:47,511
<i>in front of all these witnesses.</i>

654
01:19:47,616 --> 01:19:50,016
We'll make a report
to the authorities.

655
01:19:53,421 --> 01:19:55,548
Get up and get to work.

656
01:19:55,657 --> 01:19:59,787
One of these days, you'll see more
of the authorities than you want to see.

657
01:20:40,969 --> 01:20:44,564
The foreman says--
He says you're making too much noise!

658
01:20:47,609 --> 01:20:49,668
What did you say?

659
01:20:49,778 --> 01:20:52,679
God, you're homely.

660
01:20:52,781 --> 01:20:56,478
- The foreman says--
- You must talk a little louder. I can't hear!

661
01:20:56,585 --> 01:20:59,383
- <i>You're making</i>-- <i>You're making too much noise.</i>

662
01:20:59,487 --> 01:21:02,047
- He said to tell you.
- <i>Too much noise, little chicken?</i>

663
01:21:02,157 --> 01:21:04,057
<i>I think you should help us</i>
<i>make too much noise.</i>

664
01:21:04,159 --> 01:21:06,889
Come on.
Sing us a little song.

665
01:21:06,995 --> 01:21:09,259
I wonder if he sings
like a chicken as well.

666
01:21:12,267 --> 01:21:14,929
You tell the foreman to run
his own errands...

667
01:21:15,036 --> 01:21:18,164
and not to send
his favorite whelp!

668
01:21:18,273 --> 01:21:21,299
<i>Scoot! Run!</i>

669
01:21:21,409 --> 01:21:24,742
- Scoot!

670
01:21:26,781 --> 01:21:29,978
<i>Run to the fat foreman!</i>

671
01:21:35,123 --> 01:21:37,717
- I ain't dead yet.

672
01:21:37,826 --> 01:21:40,590
<i>And not this, Ole Olsen.</i>

673
01:23:03,211 --> 01:23:06,738
- Where are you going, Erik?
- To rest.

674
01:23:06,848 --> 01:23:10,875
- What's that word?
- Rest.

675
01:23:10,986 --> 01:23:14,979
No, you can't rest now.
You get back at the job.

676
01:23:15,090 --> 01:23:17,422
- You're after me again?
- After you?

677
01:23:17,525 --> 01:23:19,425
What makes you think that?

678
01:23:19,527 --> 01:23:21,586
The others are resting.

679
01:23:21,696 --> 01:23:23,596
Yes, they get a rest
because they've earned it.

680
01:23:23,698 --> 01:23:25,962
You get back on the job.

681
01:23:27,168 --> 01:23:29,636
- I'm always the one you pick on.
- Oh!

682
01:23:29,738 --> 01:23:33,003
Are your feelings hurt?

683
01:23:33,108 --> 01:23:35,440
That's for being so clever.

684
01:23:35,543 --> 01:23:38,239
For all the kind words
that you say...

685
01:23:38,346 --> 01:23:40,837
while my back is turned.

686
01:23:45,854 --> 01:23:48,755
Just what the hell do you think
you're getting paid for?

687
01:23:48,857 --> 01:23:51,052
Are you so thick, so stupid...

688
01:23:51,159 --> 01:23:54,458
that you think
you're on a paid vacation?

689
01:23:54,562 --> 01:23:57,395
Final order--you get back
to work right now...

690
01:23:57,499 --> 01:24:00,127
stinking Swedish bum!

691
01:24:06,007 --> 01:24:10,000
All right. You get turned
into the authorities.

692
01:24:10,111 --> 01:24:12,443
And you won't get a single krone.

693
01:24:12,547 --> 01:24:15,175
Not a krone, Erik.

694
01:24:15,283 --> 01:24:18,150
You're all done.

695
01:25:22,717 --> 01:25:24,947
Lasse! Hurry, they're coming!

696
01:25:46,708 --> 01:25:49,700
Dear Jesus. They're gonna do it.

697
01:26:28,016 --> 01:26:30,541
I'm gonna--

698
01:27:10,558 --> 01:27:13,083
Put him in the cellar.

699
01:27:22,737 --> 01:27:24,967
<i>You heard me!</i>
<i>Put him in the cellar!</i>

700
01:27:37,485 --> 01:27:39,715
<i>The rest of you go back to work.</i>

701
01:28:48,056 --> 01:28:50,456
- Come inside to get warm.
- Oh, thank you.

702
01:28:50,558 --> 01:28:53,220
It's a strong wind.

703
01:29:02,170 --> 01:29:05,799
<i>And then Mama died. And now she's lying</i>
<i>back home in the cemetery...</i>

704
01:29:05,907 --> 01:29:08,432
in Tomelilla.

705
01:29:08,543 --> 01:29:10,909
<i>So your father's a widower.</i>

706
01:29:15,350 --> 01:29:17,318
That's the word.

707
01:29:19,620 --> 01:29:23,454
The sea is hard.
My husband went to sea a year ago.

708
01:29:23,558 --> 01:29:26,356
<i>And I've been like a widow since.</i>

709
01:29:29,897 --> 01:29:31,865
Has he drowned?

710
01:29:34,068 --> 01:29:36,866
I can't say.
I haven't received an omen.

711
01:29:48,816 --> 01:29:52,582
It's been a year that
she's been living all alone.

712
01:29:52,687 --> 01:29:55,850
<i>That's what she said.</i>

713
01:29:55,957 --> 01:29:58,289
That's a long time out here.

714
01:29:59,694 --> 01:30:01,958
<i>A long time.</i>

715
01:30:06,801 --> 01:30:09,929
<i>Now you told her Mama was dead.</i>

716
01:30:10,037 --> 01:30:12,437
Yes, of course you did, yes.

717
01:30:28,723 --> 01:30:31,920
This is all that's left
of your mother's things, Pelle.

718
01:30:34,695 --> 01:30:37,664
Now, though, it's all or nothing.

719
01:30:37,765 --> 01:30:40,256
Pelle-- Pelle, could you...

720
01:30:40,368 --> 01:30:42,268
visit Mrs. Olsen
tomorrow after school?

721
01:30:42,370 --> 01:30:45,862
And you can say I sent... my--

722
01:30:45,973 --> 01:30:49,500
my thanks for taking you
in and treating you so well.

723
01:30:57,218 --> 01:31:00,187
I had an omen last night.

724
01:31:00,288 --> 01:31:03,780
In fact, you could call it
a form of vision.

725
01:31:03,891 --> 01:31:07,190
I dreamt there was a huge dog
standing there, next to the bed.

726
01:31:09,230 --> 01:31:11,425
<i>His coat was dripping wet.</i>

727
01:31:11,532 --> 01:31:15,662
<i>And I knew it was the ship's dog</i>
<i>with a message for me.</i>

728
01:31:15,770 --> 01:31:18,534
<i>I got out of bed...</i>
<i>and outside my window...</i>

729
01:31:18,639 --> 01:31:21,608
<i>I saw a ship go down</i>
<i>with all hands.</i>

730
01:31:22,910 --> 01:31:25,276
<i>Then I saw my husband</i>
<i>rise to heaven.</i>

731
01:31:27,248 --> 01:31:30,183
He was dripping wet
with salt water.

732
01:31:31,419 --> 01:31:34,320
I realized immediately...

733
01:31:34,422 --> 01:31:38,381
that the dog was
an omen from him.

734
01:32:10,691 --> 01:32:13,819
- <i>Who's there?</i>
- It's Pelle's father.

735
01:32:13,928 --> 01:32:15,896
Lasse Karlsson.

736
01:32:47,295 --> 01:32:51,231
- You're Pelle's father?
- Yeah. Uh--

737
01:32:51,332 --> 01:32:53,857
He's very young, your son.

738
01:32:53,968 --> 01:32:56,095
- Uh, yeah.
- Come.

739
01:32:56,203 --> 01:32:58,797
Sit.

740
01:33:05,212 --> 01:33:09,239
Yeah, Pelle was a... latecomer,
you might say.

741
01:33:13,554 --> 01:33:16,819
But I can still do
a good man's work, though.

742
01:33:16,924 --> 01:33:19,017
In every way.

743
01:33:19,126 --> 01:33:21,924
- Drink.
- Yeah.

744
01:33:31,439 --> 01:33:35,773
Thanks for the drink.
Now, I must be on my way.

745
01:33:35,876 --> 01:33:39,642
Eat. Eat.

746
01:33:39,747 --> 01:33:44,013
That's how you get to know
something about a man.

747
01:33:44,118 --> 01:33:48,919
- <i>You walked a long way.</i>
- Yeah, I just came by to thank
you for being kind to Pelle.

748
01:33:49,023 --> 01:33:50,991
Now, now. That's enough talk.

749
01:33:51,092 --> 01:33:53,856
Go ahead. Please.

750
01:33:57,064 --> 01:33:59,931
You must have been
a good wife to your husband.

751
01:34:00,034 --> 01:34:03,765
Yeah. That's true enough.

752
01:34:03,871 --> 01:34:07,830
Everything and anything he desired,
when he was on dry land.

753
01:34:07,942 --> 01:34:11,434
But he was ungrateful.
You become tired of that.

754
01:34:13,381 --> 01:34:17,112
I don't think my wife would have
spoken that way of me.

755
01:34:17,218 --> 01:34:20,813
There's lots to do in a house like this,
if there's a man to help.

756
01:34:20,921 --> 01:34:23,389
Yeah. Yeah.

757
01:34:23,491 --> 01:34:26,324
There's only one cow.

758
01:34:26,427 --> 01:34:28,759
But one could become two.

759
01:34:30,698 --> 01:34:33,929
I'm only a poor laborer
by comparison.

760
01:34:36,137 --> 01:34:38,901
But we have decent clothes, both of us.

761
01:34:39,974 --> 01:34:42,568
And I have a good pair of hands.

762
01:34:44,011 --> 01:34:46,445
And you'd not be afraid
to use them, would you?

763
01:34:46,547 --> 01:34:49,675
Not in the least.

764
01:34:51,085 --> 01:34:54,350
Nor afraid of, uh...

765
01:34:54,455 --> 01:34:57,549
hot coffee in bed
on Sunday mornings either.

766
01:35:05,166 --> 01:35:07,862
Then I think I should have a kiss.

767
01:35:10,504 --> 01:35:13,439
Yeah, you should.

768
01:35:25,720 --> 01:35:28,553
Yep.

769
01:35:28,656 --> 01:35:31,625
We'll hope for happiness and blessings
on the three of us.

770
01:35:32,827 --> 01:35:35,660
You already like the boy.

771
01:35:42,269 --> 01:35:44,464
You might as well stay
for the night.

772
01:35:52,113 --> 01:35:55,378
I must be back before
the cows wake up.

773
01:35:57,051 --> 01:35:59,576
And Pelle's all alone.

774
01:36:17,304 --> 01:36:20,899
Pelle! Lying out here.

775
01:36:22,176 --> 01:36:24,406
Come on. Come on.

776
01:36:28,516 --> 01:36:31,144
Everything is arranged.

777
01:36:31,252 --> 01:36:34,187
We'll have a home and
a woman to take care of us.

778
01:36:34,288 --> 01:36:37,086
Mrs. Olsen. You'll be happy.

779
01:36:39,527 --> 01:36:43,657
And maybe we'll get coffee
in bed on Sunday mornings even.

780
01:36:47,168 --> 01:36:49,932
Come. Come.

781
01:36:52,840 --> 01:36:57,402
"Give us this day our daily bread...

782
01:36:57,511 --> 01:36:59,638
and forgive us our--"

783
01:36:59,747 --> 01:37:03,877
- <i>Do you have the Bible stories there?</i>
- Mmm.

784
01:37:03,984 --> 01:37:05,975
Does it tell the one about the man...

785
01:37:06,086 --> 01:37:08,987
whose sons pulled down his pants
and showed his--

786
01:37:09,089 --> 01:37:12,252
- Noah?
- Yeah, that's it-- Noah.

787
01:37:12,359 --> 01:37:14,953
- Old man Noah.
- "And lead us not--"

788
01:37:15,062 --> 01:37:17,496
- What did he drink, old man Noah?
- Wine.

789
01:37:17,598 --> 01:37:21,830
<i>Wine. Then he must</i>
<i>have been a rich man.</i>

790
01:37:21,936 --> 01:37:25,872
Old Noah.
And then there was the one--

791
01:37:25,973 --> 01:37:27,873
the one who was so devilish clever.

792
01:37:27,975 --> 01:37:30,102
- Now, what was his name?
- <i>Laban.</i>

793
01:37:30,211 --> 01:37:33,339
Laban. Yeah, of course.
That's who it was-- Laban.

794
01:37:33,447 --> 01:37:38,043
Laban. Laban was the name.
How did it go?

795
01:37:38,152 --> 01:37:40,052
How many wives
could a man have then?

796
01:37:40,154 --> 01:37:43,055
<i>All right,</i>
<i>I won't bother you anymore.</i>

797
01:37:46,160 --> 01:37:48,094
<i>The great prophets.</i>
<i>What were they called?</i>

798
01:37:48,195 --> 01:37:51,790
Let's see. Isaiah.

799
01:37:51,899 --> 01:37:55,494
There was Daniel and--
I remember them now.

800
01:37:55,603 --> 01:37:57,571
<i>I remember the prophets, Pelle.</i>

801
01:37:57,671 --> 01:38:01,732
- <i>if you want, you can test me</i>
<i>on the great prophets.</i>
- Let's hear them.

802
01:38:01,842 --> 01:38:05,369
Don't you think you had better start reading?
Otherwise, you could lose track.

803
01:38:05,479 --> 01:38:07,344
There were only four <i>great</i> ones.

804
01:38:12,453 --> 01:38:14,717
<i>isaiah</i>--

805
01:38:14,822 --> 01:38:16,722
- Come on, Papa.
- <i>Yeah.</i>

806
01:38:16,824 --> 01:38:18,655
First, I need to concentrate.

807
01:38:18,759 --> 01:38:22,126
They were--
They were Isaiah, Daniel--

808
01:38:22,229 --> 01:38:25,062
I had them a minute ago.
Now where did they get to?

809
01:38:25,165 --> 01:38:29,829
They were Isaiah, Daniel--

810
01:38:33,874 --> 01:38:36,001
Ah, it's not working today, Pelle.

811
01:38:36,110 --> 01:38:38,078
- You forget things when you get old.
- <i>isaiah...</i>

812
01:38:38,178 --> 01:38:40,078
Daniel--

813
01:38:40,180 --> 01:38:45,243
<i>isaiah, Daniel, Jesus</i>--

814
01:38:45,352 --> 01:38:49,118
- Ah, not Jesus. How did Jesus get in there?
- <i>isaiah...</i>

815
01:38:49,223 --> 01:38:51,657
- Yeah, their names were devilish
back in Bible days.
- <i>Daniel</i>--

816
01:38:51,759 --> 01:38:55,490
- You could hardly get your tongue around them.
- <i>Try, Papa.</i>

817
01:38:57,197 --> 01:38:59,131
- Isaiah...
- Isaiah...

818
01:38:59,233 --> 01:39:01,258
- Daniel...
- Daniel...

819
01:39:01,368 --> 01:39:04,599
- Ezekiel...
- Ezekiel and...

820
01:39:04,705 --> 01:39:07,674
-Jeremiah!
-Jeremiah!

821
01:39:07,775 --> 01:39:10,744
Isaiah, Daniel...

822
01:39:10,844 --> 01:39:13,938
Ezekiel, Jeremiah.

823
01:39:14,048 --> 01:39:16,448
Isaiah, Daniel...

824
01:39:16,550 --> 01:39:19,110
Ezekiel, Jeremiah.

825
01:39:19,219 --> 01:39:22,017
Isaiah, Daniel...

826
01:39:22,122 --> 01:39:24,613
<i>Ezekiel, Jeremiah.</i>

827
01:40:31,458 --> 01:40:33,551
Will you never grow up?

828
01:41:02,222 --> 01:41:06,750
<i>Don't be afraid. He wouldn't hurt a fly.</i>

829
01:41:16,203 --> 01:41:19,366
- Don't forget the bottles.
- That's the last thing I'd forget.

830
01:41:56,276 --> 01:41:58,642
<i>Erik, are you coming?</i>

831
01:42:01,748 --> 01:42:03,978
<i>Are you coming to the fair, Erik?</i>

832
01:42:06,687 --> 01:42:08,985
Come, Erik.

833
01:42:10,424 --> 01:42:12,585
Come on.

834
01:42:15,896 --> 01:42:17,864
Come on, Erik.

835
01:42:19,266 --> 01:42:22,861
- <i>isn't Erik coming?</i>

836
01:42:25,639 --> 01:42:28,472
He can't stay home without
the foreman to look after him.

837
01:42:28,575 --> 01:42:30,634
But he won't go.

838
01:42:30,744 --> 01:42:34,441
Can't you go inside and get him?
You're the only one he listens to.

839
01:42:40,287 --> 01:42:44,781
Come on, Erik. Let's go.

840
01:42:44,892 --> 01:42:47,383
<i>We're going to the fair.</i>

841
01:43:26,600 --> 01:43:30,502
Isaiah, Daniel,
Ezekiel and Jeremiah.

842
01:43:30,604 --> 01:43:35,405
Isaiah, Daniel,
Ezekiel and Jeremiah.

843
01:43:35,509 --> 01:43:40,242
Those were really the days.
Just think, two wives to care for you, Pelle.

844
01:43:40,347 --> 01:43:44,784
You've got one to cook the food,
the other one does all the mending and sewing.

845
01:44:13,313 --> 01:44:16,407
Beautiful teeth for sale.

846
01:44:16,516 --> 01:44:19,747
<i>Smile, and the world</i>
<i>will smile back at you.</i>

847
01:44:24,858 --> 01:44:26,849
Pelle.

848
01:44:29,363 --> 01:44:31,331
Here.

849
01:47:44,424 --> 01:47:46,415
What's going on here?

850
01:47:50,330 --> 01:47:54,460
I'm leaving, Auntie. I need to go.

851
01:47:56,236 --> 01:47:58,329
But, Signe, is there a problem?

852
01:47:58,438 --> 01:48:01,236
If so, I'm sure we can solve it.

853
01:48:01,341 --> 01:48:04,674
It's the isolation
from all my friends.

854
01:48:05,979 --> 01:48:10,348
At heart, I'm a city girl,
so-- so I'm returning.

855
01:48:10,450 --> 01:48:12,680
But you said nothing, Signe.

856
01:48:12,786 --> 01:48:15,448
I-- I know I should've
told you before this.

857
01:48:15,555 --> 01:48:19,082
I'm so disappointed.
I don't understand.

858
01:48:19,192 --> 01:48:22,286
It's just that I miss Copenhagen.

859
01:48:22,395 --> 01:48:24,590
But I thought--

860
01:48:24,698 --> 01:48:28,896
Kongstrup and I were so sure
you were happy here.

861
01:48:31,404 --> 01:48:33,599
Dear Signe.

862
01:48:33,707 --> 01:48:36,642
I don't really know
what else to say, Auntie.

863
01:48:36,743 --> 01:48:39,439
I've made my decision.

864
01:48:39,546 --> 01:48:41,571
But so suddenly.

865
01:48:41,681 --> 01:48:44,912
If you had mentioned it before,
I could understand.

866
01:48:45,018 --> 01:48:46,918
I'm sorry.

867
01:48:47,020 --> 01:48:50,046
Why didn't you--

868
01:48:50,156 --> 01:48:53,853
Is there a reason why you don't look me
in the eye? Should I know something?

869
01:48:53,960 --> 01:48:56,155
Signe?

870
01:48:58,832 --> 01:49:01,300
But how are you going to manage?

871
01:49:01,401 --> 01:49:04,928
- Well, you see--
- Who'll buy your ticket?

872
01:49:05,038 --> 01:49:08,997
Actually, Kongstrup has offered
to help me and see me to the boat.

873
01:49:09,109 --> 01:49:11,907
Oh, thank God
that I don't have to worry.

874
01:49:12,012 --> 01:49:14,207
If I could only understand you.

875
01:49:14,314 --> 01:49:17,750
You will return here for a visit?

876
01:49:17,851 --> 01:49:21,480
I'd hoped you would take over
and run the farm in our old age.

877
01:49:21,588 --> 01:49:23,852
Kongstrup too wanted it.

878
01:49:23,957 --> 01:49:27,051
Signe, dearest, don't cry.

879
01:49:27,160 --> 01:49:30,027
It's not as serious as all that.

880
01:49:30,130 --> 01:49:35,363
I want you to feel free to visit us--
visit us anytime that you want.

881
01:49:55,889 --> 01:49:58,483
<i>Kongstrup!</i>

882
01:50:00,226 --> 01:50:02,456
<i>Kongstrup!</i>

883
01:50:04,164 --> 01:50:07,190
<i>Kongstrup, come out</i>
<i>and talk to me!</i>

884
01:50:09,202 --> 01:50:12,330
I'm here to collect
the money, Kongstrup!

885
01:50:12,439 --> 01:50:14,930
Kongstrup!

886
01:50:33,693 --> 01:50:35,991
Look who it is.

887
01:50:37,597 --> 01:50:40,157
Let me say hello to you.

888
01:50:41,468 --> 01:50:43,993
<i>Too proud to say hello, are ya?</i>

889
01:50:45,305 --> 01:50:48,365
Do you think that you're better?

890
01:50:48,475 --> 01:50:51,638
Is that because you're going away to have
your bastard son on the other side of the sea...

891
01:50:51,745 --> 01:50:53,940
<i>when I had mine</i>
<i>in a turnip patch?</i>

892
01:50:54,047 --> 01:50:57,539
<i>But it was the same old whore-monger,</i>
<i>wasn't it, Signe?</i>

893
01:50:57,651 --> 01:51:01,018
The same old whore-monger
as ever! Signe?

894
01:51:01,121 --> 01:51:02,952
Signe?

895
01:51:03,056 --> 01:51:07,049
Signe, would you go and tell
the whore-monger that I need the money?

896
01:51:07,160 --> 01:51:09,856
- His wife would give me the evil eye!
- Come here, you!

897
01:51:09,963 --> 01:51:12,158
- <i>I warned you!</i>
- <i>Let me go!</i>

898
01:51:12,265 --> 01:51:17,726
<i>Let me go! Kongstrup, come out</i>
<i>and help an old sweetheart!</i>

899
01:51:17,837 --> 01:51:20,203
<i>Let me go! Let me go!</i>

900
01:51:20,306 --> 01:51:23,036
- Out! Don't come back!
- Let me go!

901
01:52:29,909 --> 01:52:31,900
Why do you stare?

902
01:52:46,526 --> 01:52:50,485
- If I have to search for you once more--
- Sorry, ma'am.

903
01:53:07,514 --> 01:53:10,176
That beats me.

904
01:53:10,283 --> 01:53:14,686
I would have thought that only death
could end such grief so quickly.

905
01:53:14,788 --> 01:53:17,951
She must have
an iron grip on herself.

906
01:54:32,599 --> 01:54:34,499
Wake up and fetch
the doctor, quick!

907
01:54:38,705 --> 01:54:43,267
- What is it, Papa?
- Oh, dear Jesus. It must be something bad.

908
01:54:50,283 --> 01:54:52,581
Karna, what is it?

909
01:54:52,685 --> 01:54:54,744
- It's so awful!
- What happened?

910
01:54:54,854 --> 01:54:57,152
- It's so awful!
- The missus cut him!

911
01:54:57,257 --> 01:55:00,158
- What-- What are you saying? What did--
- The missus cut him!

912
01:55:00,260 --> 01:55:02,490
What happened?
What happened?

913
01:55:02,595 --> 01:55:04,495
- Cut him. The missus cut him.
- What?

914
01:55:04,597 --> 01:55:07,657
- He's bleeding to death! Get some help!
-Jesus.

915
01:55:52,645 --> 01:55:56,274
It's fun. Hey!

916
01:55:57,083 --> 01:55:58,983
Psst!</i>

917
01:56:35,488 --> 01:56:38,548
Mr. Friese, could you tell us
what this means?

918
01:56:38,658 --> 01:56:43,288
<i>"Pelle Karlsson is the young cuckoo</i>
<i>in Mrs. Olsen's nest. "</i>

919
01:56:44,931 --> 01:56:48,298
- Isn't she married to a sailor?
- She's Captain Olsen's wife.

920
01:56:48,401 --> 01:56:51,461
<i>Your father doesn't care</i>
<i>about that, does he?</i>

921
01:56:51,571 --> 01:56:54,631
<i>A Swede doesn't care if a woman</i>
<i>is married or not, does he, Pelle?</i>

922
01:56:54,741 --> 01:56:58,734
- <i>Pelle's father is a real old goat.</i>
- <i>Watch out for the lech's son.</i>

923
01:56:58,845 --> 01:57:00,745
<i>Old Swedish goats like</i>
<i>married women the best.</i>

924
01:57:00,847 --> 01:57:03,145
- Stop. Stop.
- <i>What's it like in the nest, Pelle?</i>

925
01:57:05,318 --> 01:57:08,151
<i>Please stop.</i>

926
01:57:21,601 --> 01:57:25,560
- Smash this kid!
- Here's one from Captain Olsen!

927
01:57:36,049 --> 01:57:39,883
Just you wait, Pelle.
We're really gonna get you.

928
01:58:11,784 --> 01:58:14,776
Pelle?

929
01:58:14,887 --> 01:58:18,482
I've been thinking a lot
about the situation.

930
01:58:20,593 --> 01:58:22,754
You and I, we are welcome
at Mrs. Olsen's.

931
01:58:26,265 --> 01:58:29,166
We could move right in.

932
01:58:36,442 --> 01:58:39,468
I mean, I-- I know
it's against the law...

933
01:58:39,579 --> 01:58:43,447
to move in with a woman
who is wife to another.

934
01:58:43,549 --> 01:58:46,609
But... to be--

935
01:58:46,719 --> 01:58:50,815
You know, I...
want some comfort.

936
01:58:53,025 --> 01:58:56,654
We could make it look
like the two of us are lodgers.

937
01:58:59,999 --> 01:59:03,162
She-- She could
sew you new clothes.

938
01:59:03,269 --> 01:59:06,170
Wouldn't it be nice
to have new underwear?

939
01:59:08,374 --> 01:59:13,539
If-- If I did move in with Mrs. Olsen,
you'd move there too.

940
01:59:13,646 --> 01:59:15,614
You'd come with me.

941
01:59:18,651 --> 01:59:21,142
It's a lot easier for you.
Your life is all ahead of you.

942
01:59:21,254 --> 01:59:23,950
Your whole future
to make something happen.

943
01:59:24,056 --> 01:59:26,786
I need someone
to take care of me.

944
01:59:26,893 --> 01:59:30,693
I'll run away
if you go and stay there.

945
01:59:30,796 --> 01:59:33,560
You have the gall
to say that to me?

946
01:59:33,666 --> 01:59:37,193
Just look what you are doing. Someone else
will have to fill in the holes with cow dung...

947
01:59:37,303 --> 01:59:39,328
so the foreman
doesn't find you out.

948
01:59:39,438 --> 01:59:41,429
You stop that right now, Pelle!

949
01:59:41,541 --> 01:59:44,806
You'd better watch out I don't make
a carving of you and Mrs. Olsen in bed.

950
01:59:44,911 --> 01:59:47,106
You're getting a little too big for your--
Come back here!

951
01:59:47,213 --> 01:59:49,340
Come back here!
You'd better watch out...

952
01:59:49,448 --> 01:59:52,178
I don't set the foreman on ya!

953
02:00:02,461 --> 02:00:05,225
<i>Pelle!</i>

954
02:00:05,331 --> 02:00:07,356
<i>Pelle!</i>

955
02:00:07,466 --> 02:00:09,434
Pelle!

956
02:00:11,204 --> 02:00:15,368
Could you go by Mrs. Olsen's
on the way home from school?

957
02:00:16,876 --> 02:00:20,039
These are some things
she promised to mend for us.

958
02:00:21,347 --> 02:00:24,339
And be sure to tell her
I'll come by this evening.

959
02:00:24,450 --> 02:00:28,113
Why don't you marry her, Papa,
like others do?

960
02:00:28,221 --> 02:00:31,486
Really, I will.
I will, Pelle, but...

961
02:00:31,591 --> 02:00:35,357
you've got to deal
with a country's authority.

962
02:00:35,461 --> 02:00:38,919
Mrs. Olsen needs a death certificate
from the government.

963
02:00:39,031 --> 02:00:42,762
But soon, we'll have coffee in bed.

964
02:01:01,821 --> 02:01:05,450
Well, it's Mrs. Olsen's young cuckoo.

965
02:01:28,114 --> 02:01:31,515
<i>Let's see how tough</i>
<i>you are, Pelle.</i>

966
02:01:31,617 --> 02:01:35,109
- <i>into the sea with him!</i>
- <i>Run, cuckoo bird!</i>

967
02:01:46,299 --> 02:01:48,529
Run, you cuckoo bird!

968
02:01:57,710 --> 02:02:00,702
- Come on, Pelle! Let's see you dance!
- Papa's little Pelle!

969
02:02:00,813 --> 02:02:04,772
- Papa's little cuckoo bird!
- Cuckoo! Cuckoo! Cuckoo!

970
02:02:04,884 --> 02:02:06,784
<i>Cuckoo! Cuckoo! Cuckoo!</i>

971
02:02:06,886 --> 02:02:09,047
<i>What's the little cuckoo bird</i>
<i>going to do now?</i>

972
02:02:09,155 --> 02:02:11,521
<i>Go back to Sweden,</i>
<i>you whore-master’s son!</i>

973
02:02:11,624 --> 02:02:14,320
- <i>Fly away, cuckoo bird!</i>
- <i>Away! Away!</i>

974
02:02:14,427 --> 02:02:17,726
Away! Away! Away! Away!

975
02:02:17,830 --> 02:02:20,298
- <i>Run away!</i>
- <i>Run!</i>

976
02:02:20,399 --> 02:02:23,027
- <i>Run away!</i>
- <i>Run! Run!</i>

977
02:02:23,135 --> 02:02:25,035
<i>Run!</i>

978
02:03:49,388 --> 02:03:51,879
Look, it's Captain Olsen!

979
02:04:20,886 --> 02:04:22,786
You're home already.

980
02:04:27,593 --> 02:04:31,757
Pa, Mrs. Olsen's husband
has come home.

981
02:05:47,139 --> 02:05:51,200
First they steal one feather,
then another...

982
02:05:51,310 --> 02:05:54,040
till you are standing there like a...

983
02:05:54,146 --> 02:05:56,876
plucked hen in the shed.

984
02:05:56,982 --> 02:05:59,974
I was only looking for a home...

985
02:06:00,085 --> 02:06:03,213
to spend my old age in.

986
02:06:03,322 --> 02:06:07,315
Found someone,
thought I was free.

987
02:06:08,861 --> 02:06:10,886
Jesus.

988
02:06:11,931 --> 02:06:14,525
Jesus, help.

989
02:07:32,778 --> 02:07:35,303
What the hell
is the point of crying?

990
02:07:37,516 --> 02:07:40,815
I want you to meet
my new sweetheart.

991
02:07:42,454 --> 02:07:44,547
Kiss her, Pelle.

992
02:07:50,896 --> 02:07:53,694
Oh, yeah, I forgot.

993
02:07:53,799 --> 02:07:57,428
<i>You don't do such things.</i>
<i>You're too fine.</i>

994
02:07:57,536 --> 02:08:01,836
<i>Well, it doesn't help anything</i>
<i>to go around whimpering.</i>

995
02:08:04,877 --> 02:08:06,344
Oh.

996
02:08:06,445 --> 02:08:09,778
- Oh!
- Papa!

997
02:08:12,284 --> 02:08:15,151
Frisky, isn't she?

998
02:08:18,657 --> 02:08:20,955
She's a little devil.

999
02:08:27,299 --> 02:08:29,267
You're crying.

1000
02:08:31,470 --> 02:08:34,405
Did someone do something to you?

1001
02:08:34,506 --> 02:08:38,966
Tell them that your father is Lasse--
Lasse Karlsson from Tomelilla.

1002
02:08:39,078 --> 02:08:42,445
It's all right.
Your father is here...

1003
02:08:42,548 --> 02:08:46,644
<i>and your father can stand</i>
<i>on his own two feet.</i>

1004
02:08:46,752 --> 02:08:50,483
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

1005
02:08:50,589 --> 02:08:54,719
I'm going up there
to the big house.

1006
02:08:54,827 --> 02:08:59,628
Now the bastard's going to have
to answer for all these years.

1007
02:08:59,732 --> 02:09:02,132
We're gonna have a little talk
with the missus.

1008
02:09:02,234 --> 02:09:05,169
I'm not going to
let you go out there!

1009
02:09:47,880 --> 02:09:51,316
Erik? Psst, Erik.

1010
02:09:54,353 --> 02:09:56,321
<i>Erik?</i>

1011
02:09:57,456 --> 02:10:00,289
<i>Spring is coming.</i>
<i>That's what Papa says.</i>

1012
02:10:01,693 --> 02:10:04,423
<i>And when spring gets here,</i>
<i>you'll be...</i>

1013
02:10:04,530 --> 02:10:07,328
a free man.

1014
02:10:07,432 --> 02:10:09,627
Think of it.

1015
02:10:11,236 --> 02:10:15,195
<i>Then we can leave this awful place...</i>

1016
02:10:15,307 --> 02:10:17,867
<i>and go out and conquer the world.</i>

1017
02:10:42,734 --> 02:10:45,726
Pelle...

1018
02:10:45,838 --> 02:10:47,829
what is it they all talk about?

1019
02:10:47,940 --> 02:10:50,841
I wouldn't know.

1020
02:10:50,943 --> 02:10:53,309
<i>You haven't heard anything?</i>

1021
02:10:53,412 --> 02:10:57,508
Do you think I wanna go to class
and have them laugh at me some more?

1022
02:11:13,999 --> 02:11:18,026
Forgive a sinner, Jesus,
that abused your gift.

1023
02:11:18,136 --> 02:11:21,867
But it's difficult not to
when your heart is broken.

1024
02:11:27,546 --> 02:11:31,880
Pelle, I promise
you'll never again see me...

1025
02:11:31,984 --> 02:11:34,475
the way I was yesterday.

1026
02:11:34,586 --> 02:11:36,850
Then would you agree
to go to school?

1027
02:11:36,955 --> 02:11:38,855
Tomorrow, Pelle? Huh?

1028
02:11:38,957 --> 02:11:42,051
Because if you don't, Pelle...

1029
02:11:42,160 --> 02:11:44,060
then they will force you.

1030
02:11:44,162 --> 02:11:46,824
There'll be a lot of trouble
with the authority.

1031
02:11:49,401 --> 02:11:51,767
All right?

1032
02:11:51,870 --> 02:11:53,838
Say "yes."

1033
02:11:55,641 --> 02:11:58,303
Ten times 10 is 100.

1034
02:11:58,410 --> 02:12:01,971
100 times 10 is 1000.

1035
02:12:02,080 --> 02:12:05,072
100 divided by 10 is 10.

1036
02:12:05,183 --> 02:12:08,778
1000 divided by 10 is 100.

1037
02:12:16,194 --> 02:12:18,253
<i>Mr. Friese?</i>

1038
02:12:18,363 --> 02:12:21,161
Mr. Friese?

1039
02:12:21,266 --> 02:12:23,564
- He's asleep.
- Mr. Friese?

1040
02:12:23,669 --> 02:12:25,933
<i>It's time.</i>

1041
02:12:34,613 --> 02:12:38,071
Sir, it's time to go home.

1042
02:13:44,416 --> 02:13:46,850
Hey, Pelle, where's your father?

1043
02:13:50,088 --> 02:13:51,988
Running around?

1044
02:13:54,026 --> 02:13:56,586
I'm sure my father would be
happy to marry him off...

1045
02:13:56,695 --> 02:13:58,686
as Mrs. Olsen's plaything.

1046
02:14:05,604 --> 02:14:09,404
Help! Papa, help!

1047
02:14:12,778 --> 02:14:16,270
You scoundrel!
How dare you hit my son!

1048
02:14:16,381 --> 02:14:20,613
You're going to hear
from the authorities about this!

1049
02:14:26,191 --> 02:14:28,955
Oh, Pelle, Pelle, Pelle. That was about
the worst thing you could do...

1050
02:14:29,061 --> 02:14:31,757
was tackle the minister's son.

1051
02:14:31,863 --> 02:14:33,990
The town minister has power.

1052
02:14:34,099 --> 02:14:36,067
I have very little doubt
he deserved it, sure...

1053
02:14:36,168 --> 02:14:38,068
but I wish you hadn't done it.

1054
02:14:38,170 --> 02:14:41,071
- What did the boy do to you?
- He said you could get married...

1055
02:14:41,173 --> 02:14:44,609
and be Mrs. Olsen's plaything.

1056
02:14:44,709 --> 02:14:49,271
He did? He did?

1057
02:14:49,381 --> 02:14:52,214
I tell you, he's a lucky kid
I wasn't there!

1058
02:14:52,317 --> 02:14:54,148
I'd tear his guts out,
the little swine!

1059
02:14:54,252 --> 02:14:57,483
- Do you feel avenged?
- No, not really.

1060
02:14:57,589 --> 02:15:01,320
His father came and rescued him before
I could give him what he really deserved.

1061
02:15:01,426 --> 02:15:03,826
Revenge.

1062
02:15:03,929 --> 02:15:08,298
Yeah. But it's a bad situation.

1063
02:15:08,400 --> 02:15:11,494
And you're not gonna
apologize, are you?

1064
02:15:11,603 --> 02:15:13,935
Uh, no, no, naturally not.

1065
02:15:17,142 --> 02:15:21,203
It would go a lot easier
if you would. No, no, no.

1066
02:15:21,313 --> 02:15:23,543
You just gotta twist and turn...

1067
02:15:23,648 --> 02:15:26,139
same as the eel in that frying pan.

1068
02:15:30,355 --> 02:15:32,949
<i>Good day.</i>
<i>We are very sorry to bother you.</i>

1069
02:15:33,058 --> 02:15:36,323
We have no other choice
but to ask for--

1070
02:15:36,428 --> 02:15:38,794
to ask for your help.

1071
02:15:38,897 --> 02:15:41,127
Blow your nose properly, Pelle.

1072
02:15:41,233 --> 02:15:43,167
- Good day.

1073
02:15:43,268 --> 02:15:46,863
We are very sorry to bother you.
Very sorry.

1074
02:15:48,106 --> 02:15:50,074
Yeah.

1075
02:15:54,045 --> 02:15:56,240
- There's probably no one home.
-Just go in.

1076
02:15:56,348 --> 02:15:58,339
- We can't stand here all day.
- Really?

1077
02:15:58,450 --> 02:16:01,977
Well, you go first then if you think
you can handle this better, Pelle.

1078
02:16:06,391 --> 02:16:08,552
All right.

1079
02:16:08,660 --> 02:16:11,686
All right. Uh-- Uh--

1080
02:16:11,796 --> 02:16:13,889
It's like this.

1081
02:16:15,800 --> 02:16:18,098
I hope that the proprietor
won't be angry with us--

1082
02:16:18,203 --> 02:16:22,139
that he won't be--
won't be angry.

1083
02:16:25,477 --> 02:16:28,969
<i>Uh, you must forgive us...</i>

1084
02:16:29,080 --> 02:16:32,413
<i>for coming about something</i>
<i>that has nothing to do with the farm.</i>

1085
02:16:33,518 --> 02:16:35,486
<i>But, uh</i>--

1086
02:16:37,522 --> 02:16:42,653
When the father's sins
are visited on the son--

1087
02:16:42,761 --> 02:16:45,525
<i>Well, that's, uh</i>-- <i>that's, uh</i>--

1088
02:16:45,630 --> 02:16:47,996
Why are you standing?
Please, sit down.

1089
02:16:48,099 --> 02:16:52,058
- Thank you.
- Why haven't you offered them a seat, dear?

1090
02:17:00,745 --> 02:17:03,612
- Thank you.
- What is it?

1091
02:17:03,715 --> 02:17:06,309
- You need money?
- No.

1092
02:17:06,418 --> 02:17:10,013
It's that, uh--

1093
02:17:10,121 --> 02:17:12,715
It's just that, uh--

1094
02:17:15,060 --> 02:17:18,461
I hope that
you won't be angry, but...

1095
02:17:21,900 --> 02:17:24,425
<i>it's the boy.</i>

1096
02:17:24,536 --> 02:17:26,436
They're going to send away the boy.

1097
02:17:26,538 --> 02:17:29,564
<i>Send him away?</i>
<i>What have you done?</i>

1098
02:17:36,047 --> 02:17:37,947
I beat up the minister's son.

1099
02:17:39,451 --> 02:17:42,545
And why did you do that?

1100
02:17:45,223 --> 02:17:48,750
Because he said
evil things about Lasse.

1101
02:17:48,860 --> 02:17:51,055
<i>And what did he say?</i>

1102
02:17:51,162 --> 02:17:53,027
<i>He</i>--

1103
02:17:53,131 --> 02:17:55,065
<i>He called me, uh</i>--

1104
02:17:56,301 --> 02:17:58,565
He called me
Mrs. Olsen's plaything.

1105
02:17:58,670 --> 02:18:02,936
- <i>All the boys have been teasing Pelle.</i>

1106
02:18:03,041 --> 02:18:05,009
Yeah.

1107
02:18:08,446 --> 02:18:10,573
I was, uh...

1108
02:18:10,682 --> 02:18:14,482
Mrs. Olsen's sweetheart when everyone
thought she was a widow.

1109
02:18:16,588 --> 02:18:21,218
<i>And then the other day, her husband</i>
<i>came home from the sea.</i>

1110
02:18:24,329 --> 02:18:27,162
Here.

1111
02:18:27,265 --> 02:18:30,291
- <i>So the boy made Pelle furious?</i>
- Yes, unfortunately.

1112
02:18:30,402 --> 02:18:33,235
That's-- That's how it is.

1113
02:18:33,338 --> 02:18:36,535
With poor wretches,
they're only there to be pecked at.

1114
02:18:36,641 --> 02:18:39,667
<i>I prefer the bird who pecks back</i>
<i>and defends his nest...</i>

1115
02:18:39,778 --> 02:18:42,372
regardless of his wretchedness.

1116
02:18:42,480 --> 02:18:44,380
All right, I'll do what I can.

1117
02:18:44,482 --> 02:18:47,474
You needn't worry
about it anymore.

1118
02:18:47,585 --> 02:18:50,110
Thank you.

1119
02:18:50,221 --> 02:18:52,280
Oh, by the way.

1120
02:18:52,390 --> 02:18:54,915
My husband and I decided...

1121
02:18:55,026 --> 02:18:59,554
the young assistant to our foreman
will be leaving us come spring.

1122
02:18:59,664 --> 02:19:04,761
<i>We thought that perhaps Pelle</i>
<i>would like to become his replacement.</i>

1123
02:19:09,341 --> 02:19:11,571
Thank you.
Say " thank you."

1124
02:19:25,790 --> 02:19:29,817
Did you see how well I let the missus know
that you would like to take his place?

1125
02:19:29,928 --> 02:19:32,328
She thought
she thought of it herself.

1126
02:19:34,165 --> 02:19:37,293
You recognize these.
They're a bit big, but don't worry.

1127
02:19:37,402 --> 02:19:40,667
- We'll stuff them with paper.
- Try them on, Pelle.

1128
02:19:45,643 --> 02:19:49,101
I'll get some boot wax,
and they'll be like new.

1129
02:19:49,214 --> 02:19:51,648
Now, let's have a look at you.

1130
02:19:56,121 --> 02:19:59,955
Now, stand up straight.
I want you to stand very, very straight.

1131
02:20:00,058 --> 02:20:02,788
Shoulders back, the chin
a little forward, Pelle.

1132
02:20:02,894 --> 02:20:05,385
Not like that.
Lift your chin a little.

1133
02:20:05,497 --> 02:20:08,591
There. Yeah.
Now, a sharp look in the eye.

1134
02:20:08,700 --> 02:20:11,635
The thing is to command
respect for yourself.

1135
02:20:11,736 --> 02:20:15,331
The way you stand and the look
in your eye, that's what does it.

1136
02:20:17,175 --> 02:20:20,008
Yeah. Let the others labor.

1137
02:20:20,111 --> 02:20:22,272
You do the ordering.

1138
02:20:22,380 --> 02:20:25,577
"You want the night off?
Clean out the cow dung!"

1139
02:20:28,153 --> 02:20:31,953
Oh, Pelle, maybe you'll get to eat
Sunday dinner with the proprietor...

1140
02:20:32,056 --> 02:20:33,990
and have your own napkin ring.

1141
02:20:34,092 --> 02:20:35,992
It'll have your name on it--

1142
02:20:36,094 --> 02:20:39,086
Pelle Karlsson.

1143
02:20:50,141 --> 02:20:53,907
<i>And who knows, Pelle?</i>
<i>Maybe one day you'll take over as foreman.</i>

1144
02:20:54,012 --> 02:20:55,980
<i>That's why I planted the seed.</i>

1145
02:20:56,080 --> 02:20:59,015
I could tell the way
she was thinking. It was perfect.

1146
02:21:25,643 --> 02:21:27,975
Erik!

1147
02:21:31,983 --> 02:21:33,951
Erik!

1148
02:21:36,054 --> 02:21:39,854
<i>Wait, Erik! Wait for me!</i>

1149
02:21:43,261 --> 02:21:45,229
Erik!

1150
02:22:10,488 --> 02:22:12,547
I don't want it.

1151
02:22:16,427 --> 02:22:19,260
<i>We must leave here, Papa.</i>

1152
02:22:19,364 --> 02:22:21,332
<i>Now.</i>

1153
02:22:52,063 --> 02:22:55,157
- <i>It's Karna.</i>
- I got here in time.

1154
02:22:55,266 --> 02:22:58,861
I was afraid the foreman
or the missus would see me.

1155
02:22:58,970 --> 02:23:01,131
A gift for you.

1156
02:23:01,239 --> 02:23:03,764
<i>It's a down quilt.</i>
<i>it'll keep you warm at night...</i>

1157
02:23:03,875 --> 02:23:07,106
<i>no matter where in the world</i>
<i>you end up.</i>

1158
02:23:07,211 --> 02:23:09,543
Bye, Gabriella.

1159
02:23:13,117 --> 02:23:16,143
Bye, Blakka. You be a good girl.

1160
02:23:26,564 --> 02:23:31,058
Well, Aspasia,
time to say good-bye to Pelle.

1161
02:23:31,169 --> 02:23:33,501
He's going out
to see the world.

1162
02:23:41,679 --> 02:23:44,204
<i>Papa?</i>

1163
02:23:49,020 --> 02:23:50,920
What is it?

1164
02:23:58,596 --> 02:24:01,156
Can't we stay?

1165
02:24:29,093 --> 02:24:31,061
You'll have to go
without me, Pelle.

1166
02:24:32,430 --> 02:24:34,523
<i>I no longer have</i>
<i>the strength to travel.</i>

1167
02:24:34,632 --> 02:24:37,692
<i>I'm too old is the reason.</i>

1168
02:24:38,736 --> 02:24:40,704
Too old.

1169
02:24:42,373 --> 02:24:44,841
There's no future for old men.

1170
02:24:48,179 --> 02:24:50,545
Understand?

1171
02:25:09,534 --> 02:25:11,832
We'll make up a bundle for you.

1172
02:25:11,936 --> 02:25:16,202
You can have two of my shirts.
Then you will have four.

1173
02:25:16,307 --> 02:25:19,367
<i>The one you are wearing is clean.</i>

1174
02:25:19,477 --> 02:25:22,378
And, remember, never wear a shirt
for more than two weeks at a time.

1175
02:25:22,480 --> 02:25:24,641
Otherwise, you'll get
a bad name, Pelle.

1176
02:25:24,749 --> 02:25:27,115
And change your socks
before they wear out.

1177
02:25:27,218 --> 02:25:29,516
Keep your clothes clean,
keep your good name...

1178
02:25:29,620 --> 02:25:33,488
you'll save half the work
and all the shame.

1179
02:25:37,795 --> 02:25:40,923
You can have my boots too.

1180
02:25:42,300 --> 02:25:44,234
<i>Well, they are a bit worn.</i>

1181
02:25:48,172 --> 02:25:50,732
Oh, yes, here's the Bible.

1182
02:25:54,479 --> 02:25:56,947
Your mother said
I was to give it to you...

1183
02:25:57,048 --> 02:25:59,710
on the day you went out
into the world.

1184
02:26:29,981 --> 02:26:34,509
The next time we see each other,
maybe there'll be a proper home for you, Pelle.

1185
02:26:39,290 --> 02:26:41,554
Tell Karna good-bye.

1186
02:26:50,468 --> 02:26:52,436
Good-bye, Papa.

1187
02:26:54,372 --> 02:26:56,340
Thank you.
