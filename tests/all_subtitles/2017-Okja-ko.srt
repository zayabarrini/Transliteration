1
00:00:41,792 --> 00:00:45,083
<i>Oh, thank you! What a terrific crowd!</i>

2
00:00:45,167 --> 00:00:48,500
<i>Welcome to my inauguration!</i>

3
00:00:48,583 --> 00:00:52,250
I'm Lucy, Lucy Mirando,
of the Mirando Corporation.

4
00:00:52,333 --> 00:00:56,125
Welcome to my grandfather's old factory.

5
00:00:56,208 --> 00:01:02,708
Now, I know, we all know,
that Grandpa Mirando was a terrible man.

6
00:01:04,875 --> 00:01:09,875
We know of the atrocities he committed
in this space.

7
00:01:10,625 --> 00:01:16,417
We know these walls are stained
with the blood of fine working men.

8
00:01:17,167 --> 00:01:20,958
But today, I reclaim this space...

9
00:01:22,042 --> 00:01:25,000
to tell you a beautiful story.

10
00:01:26,167 --> 00:01:28,875
<i>Now the rotten CEOs are gone.</i>

11
00:01:28,958 --> 00:01:31,917
<i>It's Mirando's new era with me,</i>

12
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:35,167
<i>and with new core values,
environment and life.</i>

13
00:01:35,250 --> 00:01:36,417
<i>Awesome.</i>

14
00:01:36,500 --> 00:01:38,434
You're much more fun
than the last chief executive.

15
00:01:38,458 --> 00:01:42,083
Well, former CEO Nancy's my sister,
but, uh...

16
00:01:42,167 --> 00:01:43,458
we're very different people.

17
00:01:43,542 --> 00:01:47,375
We have very different ways of being.
We have very different business ethics.

18
00:01:47,875 --> 00:01:49,958
<i>But she's totally ignorant about humanity.</i>

19
00:01:50,042 --> 00:01:52,292
<i>She lacks vision
beyond her next round of golf.</i>

20
00:01:53,667 --> 00:01:56,500
<i>The world's population is
at seven billion.</i>

21
00:01:56,583 --> 00:02:00,542
<i>805 million human beings struggle
with hunger every day,</i>

22
00:02:00,625 --> 00:02:04,042
including 30 million right here
in the United States.

23
00:02:04,125 --> 00:02:08,083
The world is running out of food,
and we're not talking about it.

24
00:02:11,750 --> 00:02:13,167
We needed a miracle.

25
00:02:14,208 --> 00:02:15,208
And then we got one.

26
00:02:15,917 --> 00:02:18,167
Say hello to a super piglet.

27
00:02:18,875 --> 00:02:21,333
<i>This beautiful and special little creature</i>

28
00:02:21,417 --> 00:02:24,792
<i>was miraculously discovered
on one Chilean farm.</i>

29
00:02:25,417 --> 00:02:29,708
<i>We brought this precious girl
to the Mirando Ranch in Arizona.</i>

30
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:34,125
Our scientists have been raising her
with love and care ever since,

31
00:02:34,208 --> 00:02:38,375
observing and performing various studies.

32
00:02:38,667 --> 00:02:42,708
And we've successfully reproduced
26 miracle piglets

33
00:02:42,792 --> 00:02:45,417
by nonforced, natural mating.

34
00:02:47,833 --> 00:02:50,667
They are like nothing on Earth.

35
00:02:54,625 --> 00:02:59,125
Last week, we sent the 26 super piglets

36
00:02:59,208 --> 00:03:03,167
to the 26 countries
where the Mirando offices are located.

37
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:08,083
<i>Each one was given
to an esteemed local farmer.</i>

38
00:03:08,167 --> 00:03:12,583
<i>I have asked each farmer
to raise their special guest,</i>

39
00:03:12,667 --> 00:03:16,958
honoring traditional techniques
unique to their respective cultures.

40
00:03:17,042 --> 00:03:20,458
My top scientists
in the Mirando branch offices

41
00:03:20,542 --> 00:03:24,292
will be on hand to offer
whatever support is required.

42
00:03:25,958 --> 00:03:31,542
These little piggies will be the ancestors
of a whole new species.

43
00:03:32,125 --> 00:03:34,000
<i>Mama Nature's gift.</i>

44
00:03:34,083 --> 00:03:36,958
A revolution in the livestock industry.

45
00:03:37,833 --> 00:03:41,167
And now we have a competition!

46
00:03:43,708 --> 00:03:45,208
<i>Yeah!</i>

47
00:03:45,792 --> 00:03:51,583
One local farmer will raise the biggest,
most beautiful and special one.

48
00:03:51,667 --> 00:03:55,417
The ultimate super pig!
But who will it be?

49
00:03:58,458 --> 00:04:02,542
Hmm. I'm not an expert,
but I know someone who is.

50
00:04:03,250 --> 00:04:06,417
<i>TV's most beloved zoologist
and veterinarian,</i>

51
00:04:06,500 --> 00:04:09,583
and the new face
of the Mirando Corporation,

52
00:04:09,667 --> 00:04:11,833
Dr. Johnny Wilcox!

53
00:04:12,500 --> 00:04:15,375
Who said a brilliant scientist
can't be fun?

54
00:04:17,542 --> 00:04:20,333
See, everybody wants to eat him up.

55
00:04:20,417 --> 00:04:21,583
Aw!

56
00:04:22,250 --> 00:04:24,792
When the competition reaches its climax,

57
00:04:24,875 --> 00:04:29,917
Dr. Johnny will crown the winner
at a <i>Magical Animals</i> live telecast

58
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:32,042
right here in New York City.

59
00:04:32,125 --> 00:04:35,875
<i>And that is when we will unveil
our super pigs to the world.</i>

60
00:04:35,958 --> 00:04:37,667
How long will the wait be?

61
00:04:37,750 --> 00:04:40,583
When do we get to see the big pig
with our own eyes?

62
00:04:42,333 --> 00:04:43,667
Ten years.

63
00:04:43,750 --> 00:04:45,458
Ten years?

64
00:04:45,542 --> 00:04:47,667
Jesus Christ, I'll be dead by then.

65
00:04:51,625 --> 00:04:54,000
<i>♪ All babies together... ♪</i>

66
00:04:54,542 --> 00:04:57,833
Our super pigs will not only
be big and beautiful,

67
00:04:57,917 --> 00:05:01,250
they will also leave a minimal footprint
on the environment,

68
00:05:01,333 --> 00:05:05,250
consume less feed
and produce less excretions.

69
00:05:05,333 --> 00:05:06,875
And most importantly...

70
00:05:08,792 --> 00:05:10,958
they need to taste fucking good.

71
00:05:13,292 --> 00:05:19,208
<i>♪ Oh, when will there be a harvest
For the world? ♪</i>

72
00:06:12,542 --> 00:06:15,000
It won't hurt. Don't move.

73
00:06:18,833 --> 00:06:19,833
It's okay.

74
00:06:25,542 --> 00:06:26,708
Not too hard!

75
00:06:37,167 --> 00:06:38,708
They're not even ripe yet.

76
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:15,625
You had some already!

77
00:07:58,917 --> 00:08:00,250
Okja!

78
00:08:03,542 --> 00:08:05,250
Okja, what are you doing?

79
00:08:07,500 --> 00:08:11,000
Look at all the fish here!

80
00:08:19,375 --> 00:08:20,625
Okja!

81
00:08:20,708 --> 00:08:22,750
I want fish stew today!

82
00:08:59,917 --> 00:09:01,625
What? Now?

83
00:09:02,542 --> 00:09:04,292
Again?

84
00:10:18,750 --> 00:10:19,792
Mija!

85
00:10:22,750 --> 00:10:24,250
Is she not here yet?

86
00:10:24,792 --> 00:10:25,833
Mija!

87
00:10:29,000 --> 00:10:30,417
Where has she gone off to?

88
00:10:42,500 --> 00:10:49,333
Mija Joo of 37-1, Sanyang Town!

89
00:10:50,083 --> 00:10:55,500
Promptly return home for dinner. Mija!

90
00:10:58,250 --> 00:11:00,958
Come home quick. Grandpa is starving!

91
00:12:18,625 --> 00:12:21,042
Don't be scared. It's a shortcut.

92
00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:11,500
No! Go back up!

93
00:14:04,625 --> 00:14:05,625
Okja!

94
00:14:12,667 --> 00:14:14,000
Okja!

95
00:14:20,292 --> 00:14:21,625
Okja!

96
00:14:26,292 --> 00:14:28,083
Where are you?

97
00:14:30,542 --> 00:14:31,750
Okja!

98
00:14:32,583 --> 00:14:34,208
Okja!

99
00:14:59,000 --> 00:15:00,042
Okja.

100
00:16:29,958 --> 00:16:34,833
Mundo from the office is coming to visit.

101
00:16:34,917 --> 00:16:35,958
Mundo?

102
00:16:36,708 --> 00:16:39,375
To collect the money for Okja?

103
00:16:39,917 --> 00:16:43,833
I've already sent them the money.

104
00:16:43,917 --> 00:16:46,542
So Okja is ours now, right?

105
00:16:47,458 --> 00:16:48,625
Of course.

106
00:16:52,917 --> 00:16:53,958
Hmm...

107
00:16:54,042 --> 00:16:56,167
So why is he coming? Paperwork?

108
00:17:02,583 --> 00:17:05,292
They said soccer would be on.

109
00:17:06,708 --> 00:17:07,708
Hmm?

110
00:17:16,875 --> 00:17:17,875
Huh?

111
00:17:17,917 --> 00:17:19,167
Son of a...

112
00:17:19,250 --> 00:17:21,292
Great. Now we can buy a new TV.

113
00:17:22,625 --> 00:17:25,000
This one's still fine.

114
00:17:26,167 --> 00:17:28,042
Such a tightwad...

115
00:18:53,458 --> 00:18:55,458
Welcome. Hard climb?

116
00:18:55,542 --> 00:18:56,667
Good afternoon.

117
00:18:58,833 --> 00:19:01,417
Here, have some water.

118
00:19:02,625 --> 00:19:04,625
I thought a bunch of you were coming.

119
00:19:05,750 --> 00:19:07,125
They're behind me.

120
00:19:07,708 --> 00:19:08,792
Okja!

121
00:19:11,000 --> 00:19:13,208
Always on top of her dental hygiene!

122
00:19:14,417 --> 00:19:16,500
Wait, wait. Let me out, Okja.

123
00:19:16,583 --> 00:19:17,667
Mundo?

124
00:19:18,875 --> 00:19:20,333
Hello, Mundo.

125
00:19:20,417 --> 00:19:22,417
- Did you brush your own teeth?
- Yeah.

126
00:19:32,708 --> 00:19:35,167
Retina Display!

127
00:19:35,250 --> 00:19:36,583
Bring me the black box.

128
00:19:52,792 --> 00:19:54,875
Does Okja eat and poop well?

129
00:19:55,458 --> 00:19:58,375
Yes, and she has a super high metabolism.

130
00:19:59,375 --> 00:20:01,208
Right. That's what the readings say.

131
00:20:01,292 --> 00:20:02,583
Fuck me!

132
00:20:13,708 --> 00:20:15,042
I'm here!

133
00:20:17,542 --> 00:20:18,542
All right!

134
00:20:21,250 --> 00:20:23,500
I'm fucking here, God damn it!

135
00:20:27,333 --> 00:20:30,333
He... he's that guy!
From TV, right?

136
00:20:30,417 --> 00:20:31,417
He is.

137
00:20:32,417 --> 00:20:35,375
What was it? <i>Animal Magic!</i>

138
00:20:35,458 --> 00:20:38,125
He's the "very healthy" guy!

139
00:20:39,792 --> 00:20:43,792
All the other super pigs were
on flat land, accessible by car.

140
00:20:44,625 --> 00:20:47,208
Japan's one was five minutes
from the airport.

141
00:20:48,542 --> 00:20:52,917
And you... I notice that you had to leave
the fucking mountaintop super pig

142
00:20:53,000 --> 00:20:56,333
till the end, because you knew
that the climb would rile me.

143
00:20:56,417 --> 00:20:58,792
Well, guess what? I'm riled.

144
00:20:58,875 --> 00:21:01,417
Wow.
He looks exactly like he does on TV.

145
00:21:06,958 --> 00:21:08,292
Oh, that's great.

146
00:21:11,750 --> 00:21:12,833
Can somebody...

147
00:21:13,458 --> 00:21:15,750
Can somebody at least
bring me some water?

148
00:21:15,833 --> 00:21:19,042
Seeing as I'm about to be filmed
for fucking television!

149
00:21:19,125 --> 00:21:21,851
And not sparkling water. I don't want
to belch my way through the broadcast.

150
00:21:21,875 --> 00:21:22,917
Get him some water.

151
00:21:23,000 --> 00:21:25,375
I don't think they have
sparkling water here.

152
00:21:25,458 --> 00:21:26,708
Excuse me, sir.

153
00:21:26,792 --> 00:21:30,833
If you don't mind,
Dr. Johnny's a bit thirsty.

154
00:21:31,417 --> 00:21:32,500
Thank you.

155
00:21:33,542 --> 00:21:35,083
Here's your water.

156
00:21:35,708 --> 00:21:37,333
Wait, that’s Soju...

157
00:21:37,917 --> 00:21:41,375
Hey, that’s mine...

158
00:21:53,917 --> 00:21:55,208
Hey, Okja.

159
00:21:55,292 --> 00:21:57,167
It's okay. Come on out.

160
00:21:57,250 --> 00:21:59,917
That's it... Very good.

161
00:22:20,792 --> 00:22:22,625
Well, fucking film me, Jennifer!

162
00:22:23,875 --> 00:22:25,458
You can't fake these emotions.

163
00:22:25,542 --> 00:22:27,583
Oh! Uh, film him. Um...

164
00:22:27,667 --> 00:22:29,375
Get him his uniform. Quick.

165
00:22:29,667 --> 00:22:31,667
Oh!

166
00:22:32,250 --> 00:22:34,625
They're filming!

167
00:22:34,708 --> 00:22:36,684
Pick up his bag. Come on. Uh...

168
00:22:36,708 --> 00:22:38,833
Oh, that's it. Is your... Mundo?

169
00:22:38,917 --> 00:22:42,417
Mundo, get out of the shot, please.
Thank you very much. That's it.

170
00:22:42,500 --> 00:22:45,250
And, uh, his hat. Get his hat.
Looking good, Dr. Johnny.

171
00:22:45,333 --> 00:22:46,726
That's it. Everything's gonna be okay.

172
00:22:46,750 --> 00:22:49,042
Mundo, get out of the shot.
Thank you very much.

173
00:22:49,125 --> 00:22:50,417
And... roll.

174
00:22:51,625 --> 00:22:56,417
Ten years ago, 26 local farmers
from 26 far-flung countries

175
00:22:56,500 --> 00:22:59,250
were each given a super piglet.
This year, I traveled to each...

176
00:22:59,333 --> 00:23:01,292
- What's he saying?
- Dunno.

177
00:23:01,375 --> 00:23:05,750
One of those 26 farms to decide who
will be invited to The Best Super Pig Fest

178
00:23:05,833 --> 00:23:11,000
in New York City,
where it will be unveiled to the world.

179
00:23:12,292 --> 00:23:14,292
You've done an incredible job.

180
00:23:14,375 --> 00:23:15,833
Thank you.

181
00:23:15,917 --> 00:23:17,083
Pan to the old man!

182
00:23:17,667 --> 00:23:20,708
- Oh! Pan to Johnny.
- Johnny, Johnny!

183
00:23:20,792 --> 00:23:23,583
Ever since she was little,
I've always been fascinated with Okja

184
00:23:23,667 --> 00:23:25,958
and her monthly health reports and data.

185
00:23:26,042 --> 00:23:28,417
I've only known her through numbers
and graphs and pictures,

186
00:23:28,500 --> 00:23:29,917
but seeing her here today,

187
00:23:30,000 --> 00:23:33,375
and studying her
with my own eyes and hands,

188
00:23:33,458 --> 00:23:35,542
she amazes me even more.

189
00:23:35,625 --> 00:23:37,708
This is it. The moment of mutual trust

190
00:23:37,792 --> 00:23:42,625
between Mirando's very own Dr. Johnny
and the esteemed local farmer.

191
00:23:48,458 --> 00:23:50,417
She's truly exceptional.

192
00:23:53,292 --> 00:23:56,000
How did you do it?
What were your methods?

193
00:23:58,542 --> 00:23:59,667
Hmm.

194
00:24:02,125 --> 00:24:03,684
He just let her run around.

195
00:24:03,708 --> 00:24:07,417
"He just let her run around."
How beguiling!

196
00:24:07,500 --> 00:24:10,542
Show the sash to the camera, Jennifer,
and go!

197
00:24:14,125 --> 00:24:16,542
- Ready for the festival in New York City?
- New York?

198
00:24:19,917 --> 00:24:20,917
Mm.

199
00:24:23,875 --> 00:24:24,958
Very healthy.

200
00:24:27,542 --> 00:24:28,833
One more sash, please.

201
00:24:36,500 --> 00:24:39,042
A special sash for a special little lady,

202
00:24:39,125 --> 00:24:42,667
who I'm sure helped raise this super pig
in her own special little way.

203
00:24:43,625 --> 00:24:46,417
And cut.
Get some cutaways of the pig!

204
00:24:50,792 --> 00:24:53,500
Here. Autograph, please.

205
00:24:53,583 --> 00:24:56,458
Oh, I guess I'm still hip in Korea.

206
00:24:56,542 --> 00:24:58,958
The kids at home don't really
appreciate me anymore.

207
00:24:59,042 --> 00:25:01,208
But here...

208
00:25:01,958 --> 00:25:05,083
I'm sorry if I was a little grumpy
when I first came to the farm.

209
00:25:05,167 --> 00:25:07,750
But, you know, being
a television presenter can be stressful.

210
00:25:08,458 --> 00:25:11,708
I always have to be "on"...

211
00:25:13,000 --> 00:25:15,542
now that I'm the face
of the Mirando Corporation.

212
00:25:16,208 --> 00:25:18,333
Whoever thought that would happen?

213
00:25:21,833 --> 00:25:25,750
Mija.
Let's go visit your mom and dad.

214
00:25:26,250 --> 00:25:28,708
Now? I want to watch this.

215
00:25:28,792 --> 00:25:31,583
They'll be doing this all day.

216
00:25:31,667 --> 00:25:35,792
Your mom and dad appeared
in my dream last night

217
00:25:35,875 --> 00:25:38,250
and said they missed you.

218
00:25:38,333 --> 00:25:39,583
Come on.

219
00:25:40,625 --> 00:25:41,625
Thank you.

220
00:25:48,042 --> 00:25:49,333
Come quick.

221
00:25:50,708 --> 00:25:51,833
It won't take long.

222
00:26:07,292 --> 00:26:11,500
Who do you miss more?

223
00:26:12,208 --> 00:26:14,583
Mom or dad?

224
00:26:16,125 --> 00:26:17,583
I can't remember...

225
00:26:18,250 --> 00:26:19,250
their faces.

226
00:26:22,500 --> 00:26:27,583
It's been so many years.

227
00:26:28,208 --> 00:26:32,792
Just the two of us in the mountains.

228
00:26:33,375 --> 00:26:35,500
Not two. Three.

229
00:26:35,583 --> 00:26:36,708
Huh?

230
00:26:38,333 --> 00:26:40,583
Oh, sure. Three.

231
00:26:42,792 --> 00:26:44,000
The three of us.

232
00:26:47,292 --> 00:26:49,250
Okja, too.

233
00:26:53,458 --> 00:26:54,833
Ta-da!

234
00:26:54,917 --> 00:26:57,042
Our little fatty!

235
00:26:58,667 --> 00:26:59,667
What's that?

236
00:27:00,708 --> 00:27:01,708
This is...

237
00:27:02,417 --> 00:27:03,583
a gold pig.

238
00:27:05,375 --> 00:27:08,333
100% real gold.

239
00:27:09,167 --> 00:27:10,917
In the old days,

240
00:27:11,000 --> 00:27:17,708
the elders would give a gold pig
to their daughters as a wedding gift.

241
00:27:18,542 --> 00:27:21,833
Mija, it's yours now.

242
00:27:22,583 --> 00:27:23,583
Take it.

243
00:27:24,917 --> 00:27:26,958
Why all of a sudden?

244
00:27:37,500 --> 00:27:41,875
Well, you're not getting married now...

245
00:27:43,500 --> 00:27:49,417
but... Okja is going far away...

246
00:27:50,583 --> 00:27:57,250
so you can keep this gold pig instead.

247
00:27:58,417 --> 00:27:59,625
What?

248
00:28:00,167 --> 00:28:05,458
The pig competition's nearly over.

249
00:28:06,208 --> 00:28:10,042
So they're taking all the pigs back
to the company.

250
00:28:10,750 --> 00:28:12,208
But Okja's ours.

251
00:28:12,917 --> 00:28:14,375
We bought her from them.

252
00:28:15,042 --> 00:28:17,208
You sent them the money!

253
00:28:18,333 --> 00:28:19,625
Actually...

254
00:28:19,708 --> 00:28:22,792
they wouldn't let me buy Okja.

255
00:28:22,875 --> 00:28:27,000
So I bought you this gold pig instead.

256
00:28:28,667 --> 00:28:31,292
- What are you talking about?!
- Huh?

257
00:28:35,042 --> 00:28:36,625
Hey, did you hear that?

258
00:28:37,500 --> 00:28:41,750
Your daughter raises her voice at me now.

259
00:28:46,750 --> 00:28:47,750
Mija.

260
00:28:48,458 --> 00:28:55,042
They say Okja was selected
as the best pig.

261
00:28:55,125 --> 00:28:58,542
They have plans for her in America.

262
00:28:58,625 --> 00:28:59,917
America?

263
00:29:00,000 --> 00:29:05,375
She'll spend the night
at the Mirando building in Seoul.

264
00:29:05,958 --> 00:29:10,917
And tomorrow,
she'll be on a plane to America.

265
00:29:13,125 --> 00:29:17,375
She's a celebrity now!

266
00:29:21,958 --> 00:29:22,958
Mija.

267
00:29:23,792 --> 00:29:26,292
To be honest...

268
00:29:27,000 --> 00:29:29,667
you're nearly a grown woman now.

269
00:29:29,750 --> 00:29:36,542
I don't like you playing
with that pig all day.

270
00:29:37,042 --> 00:29:41,500
You should go to town, meet a boy and...

271
00:31:05,500 --> 00:31:06,583
Okja...

272
00:31:29,750 --> 00:31:30,875
Hmm!

273
00:32:05,167 --> 00:32:07,250
You must be hungry.

274
00:32:08,333 --> 00:32:12,250
I made your favorite, chicken stew.

275
00:32:12,333 --> 00:32:14,458
Go wash up so we can eat.

276
00:32:14,542 --> 00:32:17,250
I put in this and that.

277
00:32:18,958 --> 00:32:22,417
Everything that's good for you.

278
00:32:25,917 --> 00:32:27,833
Where are you going?

279
00:32:28,792 --> 00:32:29,792
Seoul.

280
00:32:30,542 --> 00:32:31,583
What?

281
00:32:32,292 --> 00:32:33,917
I'm going to bring Okja home.

282
00:32:34,458 --> 00:32:36,125
Are you crazy?

283
00:32:36,208 --> 00:32:40,125
Seoul? In the middle of the night?

284
00:32:40,208 --> 00:32:43,000
You have no money to go to Seoul.

285
00:32:47,000 --> 00:32:50,083
Stop! It's dangerous. Don't move!

286
00:32:50,167 --> 00:32:51,792
Oh, my God...

287
00:32:52,750 --> 00:32:54,417
Oh, God...

288
00:32:54,500 --> 00:32:55,750
Go away, you'll get hurt!

289
00:33:00,375 --> 00:33:03,042
Where do you think you're going?

290
00:33:03,125 --> 00:33:04,792
You're not going anywhere!

291
00:33:10,000 --> 00:33:11,042
Stop right there!

292
00:33:28,042 --> 00:33:31,208
Blade shoulder! Loin! Spare rib! Hock!

293
00:33:31,833 --> 00:33:32,833
Got it?

294
00:33:34,833 --> 00:33:38,000
This is what will happen to her.

295
00:33:38,083 --> 00:33:40,333
This is Okja's fate!

296
00:33:41,042 --> 00:33:42,167
Fate!

297
00:33:44,125 --> 00:33:45,125
Mija.

298
00:33:51,417 --> 00:33:53,083
Mija! Mija!

299
00:33:56,042 --> 00:33:57,083
Mija!

300
00:33:58,667 --> 00:33:59,667
Mija!

301
00:34:01,792 --> 00:34:03,375
Mija!

302
00:35:23,792 --> 00:35:25,792
Excuse me!

303
00:35:35,875 --> 00:35:37,083
I'm here for Okja!

304
00:35:38,625 --> 00:35:40,917
Use the phone.

305
00:35:57,042 --> 00:35:59,083
Hey, could you come to the lobby?

306
00:36:01,333 --> 00:36:05,375
No, some kid is here.
She wants me to open the door.

307
00:36:05,458 --> 00:36:08,000
<i>Please state the name you are looking for.</i>

308
00:36:08,708 --> 00:36:10,833
M-U-N-D-O.

309
00:36:10,917 --> 00:36:12,583
<i>Sorry, please speak clearly.</i>

310
00:36:13,250 --> 00:36:16,750
You can't just send anybody up here.

311
00:36:18,375 --> 00:36:20,292
Screen these people, okay?

312
00:36:20,375 --> 00:36:23,125
M-U-N-D-O!

313
00:36:25,875 --> 00:36:27,125
Excuse me!

314
00:36:29,792 --> 00:36:30,833
Excuse me!

315
00:36:59,542 --> 00:37:01,000
What the...

316
00:37:10,625 --> 00:37:13,167
You little bitch! Hey!

317
00:37:16,958 --> 00:37:18,375
Mundo!

318
00:37:37,292 --> 00:37:38,208
Hey!

319
00:37:38,292 --> 00:37:39,667
You little shit!

320
00:37:39,750 --> 00:37:42,708
- Stay where you are!
- Hey! Stop!

321
00:37:47,167 --> 00:37:49,542
Just open the door!

322
00:37:50,667 --> 00:37:53,208
Open the door so we can talk.

323
00:37:53,292 --> 00:37:54,292
Hey!

324
00:37:55,750 --> 00:37:58,083
Open the damn door!

325
00:37:58,167 --> 00:37:59,167
Okja!

326
00:38:02,667 --> 00:38:05,250
Okja! Okja!

327
00:38:06,083 --> 00:38:09,917
Come on, you guys. Stop taking photos,
okay? This is classified.

328
00:38:10,000 --> 00:38:12,500
These are direct orders
from HQ in America.

329
00:38:12,583 --> 00:38:14,458
No photos!

330
00:38:14,542 --> 00:38:19,208
I don't want to see anything
on Instagram or Facebook. Okay?

331
00:38:20,500 --> 00:38:22,020
Okja! Okja!

332
00:38:22,083 --> 00:38:24,667
Okja, I'm here! Okja!

333
00:38:24,750 --> 00:38:27,167
Let's talk!
Where are you going?

334
00:38:28,125 --> 00:38:29,125
Wait! No, stop!

335
00:38:46,417 --> 00:38:50,250
Look how tall the truck is! Right?

336
00:38:54,625 --> 00:38:55,667
Are you new here?

337
00:39:00,833 --> 00:39:02,125
Call the police!

338
00:39:02,208 --> 00:39:03,833
Wait! Stop! Damn it!

339
00:40:09,667 --> 00:40:13,000
What does that say? 4.2...

340
00:40:13,958 --> 00:40:17,542
This isn't taller than 4.2 meters, is it?
Is it?

341
00:40:19,042 --> 00:40:20,042
Oh!

342
00:40:24,208 --> 00:40:28,333
Do you have a license to drive this thing?

343
00:40:28,417 --> 00:40:29,542
A commercial license?

344
00:40:36,667 --> 00:40:40,167
Wait! Hey! Come on, now! Hey, no!

345
00:40:48,208 --> 00:40:50,958
Okja! Okja!

346
00:40:51,042 --> 00:40:53,750
Okja!

347
00:40:54,375 --> 00:40:56,708
What now? What's that noise?

348
00:40:57,875 --> 00:40:58,875
What's that?

349
00:41:09,625 --> 00:41:11,208
What the hell?

350
00:41:17,208 --> 00:41:18,375
Nice to meet you.

351
00:41:19,625 --> 00:41:20,917
We're not terrorists!

352
00:41:21,750 --> 00:41:22,833
What?

353
00:41:22,917 --> 00:41:24,250
We don't like violence!

354
00:41:25,000 --> 00:41:26,875
We don't want to hurt you!

355
00:41:26,958 --> 00:41:30,250
Stop... stop the truck!

356
00:41:31,667 --> 00:41:33,083
What the hell is he saying?

357
00:41:33,167 --> 00:41:34,333
Stop...

358
00:41:34,417 --> 00:41:36,375
Just cooperate, guy.

359
00:41:36,458 --> 00:41:37,500
What?

360
00:41:59,458 --> 00:42:00,375
Hi.

361
00:42:00,458 --> 00:42:03,083
- Hey. Hey, over here!
- What's going on?

362
00:42:03,167 --> 00:42:05,625
Hey, old man! Safety!

363
00:42:06,625 --> 00:42:08,042
I don't think he gets it!

364
00:42:08,917 --> 00:42:12,417
Buckle! Buckle!

365
00:42:12,500 --> 00:42:14,375
Put on your seat belt!

366
00:42:14,458 --> 00:42:16,417
'Cause we're gonna come
on board now, right?

367
00:42:16,500 --> 00:42:21,875
But we're not gonna hurt you.
You'll be okay. Yes? Okay.

368
00:42:45,500 --> 00:42:47,000
No compromise!

369
00:42:51,250 --> 00:42:53,708
Hey! Hands up!

370
00:42:53,792 --> 00:42:56,032
- We come in peace! Drop that!
- Stay back!

371
00:42:56,667 --> 00:42:59,000
Hello? Police?

372
00:42:59,083 --> 00:43:01,125
Terrorists! There are terrorists here!

373
00:43:01,833 --> 00:43:03,208
Hey!

374
00:43:15,542 --> 00:43:17,042
What's he writing?

375
00:43:19,458 --> 00:43:21,583
Is this fucking amusing to you?

376
00:43:21,667 --> 00:43:24,667
It's not mine. It's company property.

377
00:43:28,125 --> 00:43:31,042
Everybody follow...

378
00:43:31,292 --> 00:43:32,917
Okja!

379
00:43:42,625 --> 00:43:43,667
Okja!

380
00:43:44,625 --> 00:43:47,375
Hold her! Hold her!

381
00:43:47,458 --> 00:43:49,167
No, no. No!

382
00:44:03,083 --> 00:44:04,542
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa!

383
00:44:06,375 --> 00:44:08,333
- Hey! Hey!
- Whoa, whoa, stop!

384
00:44:09,458 --> 00:44:10,625
Catch her!

385
00:44:13,500 --> 00:44:14,667
Everybody in the van!

386
00:44:19,042 --> 00:44:21,583
They're leaving!
Start the truck! Quick!

387
00:44:22,292 --> 00:44:24,208
- Fuck it.
- What?

388
00:44:24,292 --> 00:44:27,792
What do I care?
I'm leaving this shithole anyway.

389
00:44:27,875 --> 00:44:28,875
Huh?

390
00:44:29,875 --> 00:44:30,917
You know what?

391
00:44:32,500 --> 00:44:35,458
I do have a commercial license,
but I don’t have workman’s comp.

392
00:44:37,750 --> 00:44:40,500
Insurance? You want insurance?

393
00:44:41,125 --> 00:44:43,417
Then show some loyalty to the company!

394
00:44:43,500 --> 00:44:46,167
This is what company loyalty looks like!

395
00:44:55,042 --> 00:44:56,042
This way!

396
00:44:57,458 --> 00:44:58,500
Go!

397
00:45:06,542 --> 00:45:07,875
I'm sorry!

398
00:45:10,167 --> 00:45:11,667
Get out of the way!

399
00:45:27,292 --> 00:45:30,542
Oh!

400
00:45:33,625 --> 00:45:34,750
Watch out!

401
00:45:58,750 --> 00:45:59,750
Move!

Fruity Lucy Lemon?

440
00:49:50,458 --> 00:49:53,351
The girl showed up, so I'm
providing the team with unfolding intel.

441
00:49:53,375 --> 00:49:55,059
- I don't care. Sounds creepy.
- I'm not creepy.

00:50:14,958 --> 00:50:16,167
He's Jay.

446
00:50:17,625 --> 00:50:19,125
My name is K.

447
00:50:21,750 --> 00:50:22,750
I'm Red.

448
00:50:25,083 --> 00:50:27,250
- Silver.
- I'm Blond.

449
00:50:34,625 --> 00:50:37,958
I'm Mija. This is Okja.

450
00:50:38,042 --> 00:50:39,750
We are animal lovers.

451
00:50:43,333 --> 00:50:46,625
We rescue animals
from slaughterhouses, zoos, labs.

452
00:50:46,708 --> 00:50:49,667
We tear down cages and set them free.

453
00:50:49,750 --> 00:50:53,708
This is why we rescued Okja.

454
00:51:06,750 --> 00:51:08,150
Thank you very much.

455
00:51:09,500 --> 00:51:14,792
For 40 years, our group has liberated
animals from places of abuse.

456
00:51:18,583 --> 00:51:20,208
- Is that it?
- Yeah.

457
00:51:22,208 --> 00:51:23,208
Go on.

458
00:51:24,375 --> 00:51:27,833
- It's very important she gets every word.
- It's all right. That's it.

459
00:51:27,917 --> 00:51:31,375
We inflict economic damage on those
who profit from their misery.

460
00:51:31,458 --> 00:51:33,875
We reveal their atrocities to the public.

461
00:51:33,958 --> 00:51:37,458
And we never harm anyone,
human or nonhuman.

462
00:51:37,542 --> 00:51:40,250
That is our 40-year credo.

463
00:51:41,542 --> 00:51:43,833
We...

464
00:51:43,958 --> 00:51:46,083
fight people who harm animals...

465
00:51:46,875 --> 00:51:48,643
What was the second thing you said?

466
00:51:48,667 --> 00:51:50,893
- We reveal their atrocities...
- Yeah.

467
00:52:00,125 --> 00:52:01,708
- Whoa!
- Are you okay, Silver?

468
00:52:01,792 --> 00:52:03,000
I'm fine.

469
00:52:03,750 --> 00:52:05,875
- You okay?
- I'm good. I'm... I'm good.

470
00:52:05,958 --> 00:52:07,438
He still hasn't eaten anything?

471
00:52:07,917 --> 00:52:08,917
No, he's, uh...

472
00:52:09,958 --> 00:52:12,958
still trying to leave the smallest
footprint on the planet that he can.

473
00:52:13,042 --> 00:52:15,333
All food production is exploitative.

474
00:52:16,583 --> 00:52:17,792
- Try this.
- Mmm-mmm.

475
00:52:17,875 --> 00:52:19,167
Come on. It's just a tomato.

476
00:52:19,250 --> 00:52:21,375
Ripened in ethylene gas.
Transported in trucks.

477
00:52:21,458 --> 00:52:25,667
I admire your conviction, Silver,
but your pallid complexion concerns me.

478
00:52:30,125 --> 00:52:32,167
How long have you and Okja lived together?

479
00:52:36,708 --> 00:52:37,917
Since she was four.

480
00:52:39,208 --> 00:52:41,125
Do you know
where she was being taken?

481
00:52:44,042 --> 00:52:49,458
To America.
To the Best Super Pig Competition.

482
00:52:49,542 --> 00:52:53,083
Yes. But she was being taken
somewhere else first.

483
00:52:53,167 --> 00:52:56,708
This is where they're really taking Okja.

484
00:52:56,792 --> 00:52:59,792
This underground laboratory
in Paramus, New Jersey.

485
00:53:00,833 --> 00:53:03,792
This is the building
where Okja was created.

486
00:53:16,167 --> 00:53:20,625
She thinks she was born in Arizona
and her mom in Chile.

487
00:53:20,708 --> 00:53:24,708
Mija. Everything you believe you know
about Okja is a lie.

488
00:53:25,333 --> 00:53:29,333
Okja was created in this lab.
So was her so-called mother.

489
00:53:30,583 --> 00:53:33,000
This is the building
where Mirando experiments

490
00:53:33,083 --> 00:53:35,333
on their genetically-mutated animals.

491
00:53:35,958 --> 00:53:38,458
Because genetic mutation is too dangerous,

492
00:53:38,542 --> 00:53:42,667
Mirando's been disguising it
as natural, safe and non-GMO.

493
00:53:42,750 --> 00:53:44,625
But that's a complete scam.

494
00:53:44,708 --> 00:53:48,875
Millions of GM pigs are already lining up
in front of slaughterhouses.

495
00:53:48,958 --> 00:53:53,417
You and the other local farmers
are just promotional devices for them.

496
00:53:53,500 --> 00:53:55,292
Just a picturesque backdrop.

497
00:53:59,042 --> 00:54:00,417
Promotion.

498
00:54:00,500 --> 00:54:02,792
Mirando know their consumers
would be disgusted

499
00:54:02,875 --> 00:54:05,083
by the idea of eating mutant, GM foods.

500
00:54:05,750 --> 00:54:08,042
So ten years ago, their boss,
Lucy Mirando,

501
00:54:08,125 --> 00:54:11,375
went inside the lab and dug around
amongst all the disfigured creatures

502
00:54:11,458 --> 00:54:13,958
to find the 26 prettiest ones,

503
00:54:14,042 --> 00:54:15,708
like your Okja.

504
00:54:15,792 --> 00:54:19,500
And then, big fanfare,
she sent them around the world.

505
00:54:19,583 --> 00:54:21,708
They've been frantically
breeding their super pigs,

506
00:54:21,792 --> 00:54:26,208
and soon, the supermarkets will be filled
with their flesh and organs.

507
00:54:26,292 --> 00:54:29,625
Dog food, hot dogs, bacon and jerky.

508
00:54:29,708 --> 00:54:32,250
Our plan is to put a stop
to their project.

509
00:54:32,333 --> 00:54:35,833
But to do so,
we need video from inside the lab,

510
00:54:35,917 --> 00:54:40,000
footage of the horrible atrocities
being committed against the animals.

511
00:54:40,083 --> 00:54:44,083
And there's a problem.
The security is impenetrable.

512
00:54:44,667 --> 00:54:47,417
But... there is a way.

513
00:54:49,000 --> 00:54:52,417
Although we will only go ahead with it
if you give us your consent.

514
00:54:52,500 --> 00:54:56,417
Jay. If this kid doesn't give her consent,
what, we just abandon the mission?

515
00:54:56,500 --> 00:54:57,750
Is that what you're saying?

516
00:54:58,333 --> 00:55:01,500
'Cause, brother, we've come halfway
around the world for this.

517
00:55:01,583 --> 00:55:04,208
- We should get this done now.
- Ugh! Don't be so selfish.

518
00:55:04,292 --> 00:55:07,542
This isn't about you or us,
and she is Okja's family.

519
00:55:07,625 --> 00:55:09,167
So of course we need her consent.

520
00:55:09,250 --> 00:55:12,667
I will not harm her by forcing a mission
upon her that she does not consent to.

521
00:55:12,750 --> 00:55:15,750
As members of the ALF,
we are obliged to honor its credo.

522
00:55:15,833 --> 00:55:20,167
We are going to abort because some guy
from the 1970s wrote a fucking credo?

523
00:55:20,250 --> 00:55:21,875
Is that what you're saying?

524
00:55:21,958 --> 00:55:24,083
Tradition does not make
a movement strong.

525
00:55:25,417 --> 00:55:27,292
We make a movement strong.

526
00:55:27,375 --> 00:55:30,055
If that's how you feel, call yourself
something else and not the ALF

527
00:55:30,125 --> 00:55:31,165
and get out of this truck.

528
00:55:32,667 --> 00:55:38,083
In order to expose Mirando,
we need video from inside the lab.

529
00:55:38,167 --> 00:55:39,958
And this is where Okja comes in.

530
00:55:41,292 --> 00:55:44,625
The Mirando scientists are dying to run
tests on her in their underground lab.

531
00:55:44,708 --> 00:55:47,750
Their star super pig.
Which is why we've made this.

532
00:55:49,500 --> 00:55:52,417
It looks exactly like the black box
on her ear, right?

533
00:55:53,333 --> 00:55:58,125
Only this one can wirelessly send
a video feed to us from inside the lab.

534
00:55:58,208 --> 00:56:01,250
Okja will become a hidden camera.

535
00:56:02,125 --> 00:56:03,208
Hey, Buddy.

536
00:56:03,292 --> 00:56:04,708
Hi.

537
00:56:05,333 --> 00:56:06,333
Okay.

538
00:56:06,917 --> 00:56:10,833
I'm sorry, but this was our plan.

539
00:56:12,042 --> 00:56:17,958
Rescue Okja, replace the black box
and let Mirando retake Okja.

540
00:56:18,042 --> 00:56:22,042
You want to send Okja to America?

541
00:56:22,875 --> 00:56:23,875
To this laboratory?

542
00:56:23,958 --> 00:56:25,708
Yes. But don't worry.

543
00:56:27,583 --> 00:56:29,042
They wouldn't dare hurt her.

544
00:56:30,042 --> 00:56:32,833
She needs to be perfect
for their beauty pageant.

545
00:56:32,917 --> 00:56:36,375
Whatever tests they do on her in there
will need to be harmless.

546
00:56:36,458 --> 00:56:40,417
We have a detailed plan on how to rescue
her from the event in New York City.

547
00:56:40,500 --> 00:56:42,625
We promise to bring her back to you.

548
00:56:45,917 --> 00:56:47,375
If our mission succeeds,

549
00:56:47,458 --> 00:56:50,750
we'll be able to shut down Mirando's
super pig project completely.

550
00:56:51,750 --> 00:56:56,625
And we'll be saving millions
of super pigs like Okja from death.

551
00:56:57,208 --> 00:56:59,708
But we won't do it without your approval.

552
00:57:00,542 --> 00:57:04,583
If you don't approve,
we won't do the mission.

553
00:57:07,458 --> 00:57:08,708
What is your decision?

554
00:57:09,750 --> 00:57:11,917
Take Okja back to the mountains.

555
00:57:12,000 --> 00:57:15,208
She agrees to the mission.

556
00:57:17,208 --> 00:57:18,417
Thank you.

557
00:57:18,500 --> 00:57:23,125
- Thank you so much.
- This is a giant leap for animal kind.

558
00:57:24,875 --> 00:57:25,875
Thank you.

559
00:57:26,417 --> 00:57:27,625
It's Ziploc.

560
00:57:50,583 --> 00:57:53,125
- Water won't be so bad.
- Oh, it'll be great!

561
00:57:53,208 --> 00:57:57,417
Move! Move! I'm gonna do it!
Holy shit, I'm gonna do it!

562
00:57:57,500 --> 00:57:58,917
Whoa!

563
00:58:04,917 --> 00:58:06,625
Go, go, go, go, go, go.

564
00:58:06,708 --> 00:58:08,042
Hey!

565
00:58:08,125 --> 00:58:10,458
Okja, I'll see you in New York.

566
00:58:11,167 --> 00:58:12,208
Huh?

567
00:58:12,292 --> 00:58:13,417
Till we meet again.

568
00:58:15,750 --> 00:58:20,708
Mija! Try learning English.
It opens new doors!

569
00:58:20,792 --> 00:58:22,333
Hey, wait! Mister!

570
00:58:32,542 --> 00:58:33,684
Hey, you!

571
00:58:33,708 --> 00:58:35,125
Grab him!

572
00:58:36,000 --> 00:58:38,125
He jumped! How did he do that?

573
00:58:39,292 --> 00:58:41,625
Hey, kid. It's dangerous.

574
00:58:41,708 --> 00:58:43,500
Get out of there.

575
00:58:45,333 --> 00:58:48,250
Hey, kid. Hey, come out!

576
00:59:03,625 --> 00:59:06,292
- Are you kidding me?
- It's supposed to hold.

577
00:59:06,375 --> 00:59:08,042
You're a fucking joke-show, mate.

578
00:59:09,208 --> 00:59:11,375
- Fucking awesome, epic plan, man.
- It's a Ziploc.

579
00:59:11,458 --> 00:59:13,750
- Fucking Ziploc, my ass.
- It was supposed to hold.

580
00:59:13,833 --> 00:59:14,833
Seriously?

581
00:59:14,917 --> 00:59:17,792
- You okay?
- Yeah. Yeah.

582
00:59:30,333 --> 00:59:32,375
<i>Last night in South Korea,</i>

583
00:59:32,458 --> 00:59:35,917
<i>Mirando employees were securing
their super pig when a young girl</i>

584
00:59:36,000 --> 00:59:38,000
<i>suddenly stepped in
and tried to stop them.</i>

585
00:59:38,083 --> 00:59:40,458
<i>These extraordinary events began
earlier in the day</i>

586
00:59:40,542 --> 00:59:45,542
<i>with a highly-organized pignapping attempt
made by the Animal Liberation Front.</i>

587
00:59:45,625 --> 00:59:49,375
I wouldn't worry too much, Luce.
The ALF technically failed.

588
00:59:49,458 --> 00:59:51,138
They weren't even able
to take the product.

589
00:59:51,167 --> 00:59:55,000
Yeah, it's a kerfuffle over nothing.
We shouldn't make a big deal out of it.

590
00:59:55,083 --> 00:59:58,208
It actually means our security here
in the US is so airtight,

591
00:59:58,292 --> 01:00:00,250
they wouldn't even think
about breaking in.

592
01:00:00,333 --> 01:00:01,976
Which is why they went all the way
to Korea.

593
01:00:02,000 --> 01:00:04,875
<i>The ALF hasn't been in the headlines
for a number of years,</i>

594
01:00:04,958 --> 01:00:08,583
<i>but they're back in the spotlight
after today's chaotic events.</i>

595
01:00:08,833 --> 01:00:11,750
Well, the good news is that the pig
is on its way to New York now.

596
01:00:11,833 --> 01:00:15,583
Right. And the Best Super Pig Fest
will continue as planned.

597
01:00:15,667 --> 01:00:19,375
<i>Significant damage to Mirando's
stock price seems inevitable.</i>

598
01:00:19,458 --> 01:00:22,083
<i>Yeah. Mirando is completely fucked.</i>

599
01:00:22,167 --> 01:00:25,125
<i>Mirando.
That's your current employer, correct?</i>

600
01:00:25,208 --> 01:00:27,583
<i>Yup. But I don't care.</i>

601
01:00:27,667 --> 01:00:30,875
<i>They fucked, not me. They fucked up.</i>

602
01:00:36,500 --> 01:00:39,250
I know what they're calling me,
those ALF fuckers.

603
01:00:39,958 --> 01:00:41,750
They're calling me a psychopath.

604
01:00:44,167 --> 01:00:45,667
You're not a psychopath.

605
01:00:45,750 --> 01:00:48,167
They're the psychopaths.
Right, Ms. Mirando?

606
01:00:49,083 --> 01:00:50,542
They're narcissists.

607
01:00:53,333 --> 01:00:55,083
Do narcissists wear balaclavas?

608
01:00:55,167 --> 01:00:59,000
Crazy radicals have been
calling us psychopaths since the '60s.

609
01:00:59,083 --> 01:01:00,750
"You're a psychopath.

610
01:01:00,833 --> 01:01:04,667
Your sister was a psychopath.
Your father was a psychopath."

611
01:01:04,750 --> 01:01:08,750
Well, Daddy was a psychopath, Frank.
I mean, that's hardly an unfair slur.

612
01:01:11,125 --> 01:01:12,833
"What did you do in the war, Daddy?"

613
01:01:13,417 --> 01:01:16,417
"I manufactured the napalm
that made everybody's skin fall off."

614
01:01:18,875 --> 01:01:21,625
And this is a man
who called his child an idiot loser.

615
01:01:24,042 --> 01:01:27,417
Well, in fairness to your father,
when he called you an idiot loser,

616
01:01:27,500 --> 01:01:29,420
you had just signed up
for a course in California

617
01:01:29,458 --> 01:01:31,750
called "Unleash Your Calling."

618
01:01:31,833 --> 01:01:34,875
At a highly-respected institute
for the advancement of human potential

619
01:01:34,958 --> 01:01:36,917
where many a forward-looking CEO go.

620
01:01:37,667 --> 01:01:40,083
And you know what I was doing
while I was at the institute?

621
01:01:40,167 --> 01:01:45,042
I was visualizing new
and better ways of doing business.

622
01:01:45,708 --> 01:01:48,125
While my sister was CEO...
What was the name of that lake?

623
01:01:48,208 --> 01:01:49,417
Moose Lake.

624
01:01:49,500 --> 01:01:52,333
Moose Lake. While my sister was CEO,

625
01:01:52,417 --> 01:01:55,792
dumping so much toxic waste
into Moose Lake that it exploded...

626
01:01:55,875 --> 01:01:58,708
The only lake ever to explode.
Well done, Nancy.

627
01:01:58,792 --> 01:02:05,583
I was visualizing ways of turning the most
hated agrochemical company in the world

628
01:02:05,667 --> 01:02:09,625
into the most likable
miracle pig-rearing company.

629
01:02:09,708 --> 01:02:11,708
And it's working! It's working!

630
01:02:11,792 --> 01:02:15,125
It was working until last night.

631
01:02:15,208 --> 01:02:17,000
Until six hours ago.

632
01:02:17,583 --> 01:02:23,375
The synthesis of old Mirando
and new Mirando was impeccable.

633
01:02:24,875 --> 01:02:28,000
I took nature and science,

634
01:02:28,917 --> 01:02:30,667
and I synthesized.

635
01:02:31,292 --> 01:02:33,083
And everyone loved it.

636
01:02:33,875 --> 01:02:37,292
You remember what the <i>New York Times</i>
said about our super pigs?

637
01:02:37,375 --> 01:02:39,208
"Intriguing," right?

638
01:02:39,292 --> 01:02:42,917
"Lucy Mirando is pulling off
the impossible.

639
01:02:43,000 --> 01:02:45,500
She is making us fall in love
with a creature

640
01:02:45,583 --> 01:02:47,500
that we are already looking forward
to eating."

641
01:02:47,583 --> 01:02:51,250
I mean, these are journalists
who never write about pigs.

642
01:02:51,333 --> 01:02:54,667
They never write about pigs!
They wrote about our pigs.

643
01:02:55,333 --> 01:02:56,917
Ten years in planning!

644
01:02:57,000 --> 01:03:00,667
On the cusp of a product launch
that will feed millions!

645
01:03:00,750 --> 01:03:02,292
And what happens?

646
01:03:02,375 --> 01:03:05,625
We get tangled up in this terrorism thing,

647
01:03:05,708 --> 01:03:08,917
and somehow we end up being
the ones who look bad.

648
01:03:09,000 --> 01:03:11,625
We don't look too bad.

649
01:03:11,708 --> 01:03:15,125
- We don't? Open that thing!
- Yup.

650
01:03:17,583 --> 01:03:19,292
No, rewind. Rewind.

651
01:03:21,208 --> 01:03:22,458
Rewind!

652
01:03:23,292 --> 01:03:24,292
Okay, play.

653
01:03:25,292 --> 01:03:27,768
<i>The girl was later revealed
to be the granddaughter</i>

654
01:03:27,792 --> 01:03:30,750
<i>of a local farmer selected
by Mirando CEO...</i>

655
01:03:30,833 --> 01:03:32,125
Pause, there.

656
01:03:32,833 --> 01:03:34,000
That's it.

657
01:03:34,917 --> 01:03:36,042
That's the image.

658
01:03:36,750 --> 01:03:39,625
That is the image
that is gonna destroy us.

659
01:03:40,750 --> 01:03:42,625
Who are those morons?

660
01:03:42,708 --> 01:03:44,250
Find out and fire them.

661
01:03:46,125 --> 01:03:47,125
Sure.

662
01:03:48,125 --> 01:03:50,000
Abusing that adorable girl.

663
01:03:50,833 --> 01:03:53,667
And in the uniforms
that I personally designed myself.

664
01:03:54,667 --> 01:03:57,208
And shoving her best friend onto a truck.

665
01:04:04,750 --> 01:04:06,000
That's gonna kill us.

666
01:04:07,250 --> 01:04:08,875
Right there. That's it.

667
01:04:09,458 --> 01:04:11,875
That image. We're dead.

668
01:04:50,417 --> 01:04:53,000
Lucy, may I ask you a question?

669
01:04:54,750 --> 01:04:58,000
The girl. You're thinking of bringing her
to New York, aren't you?

670
01:04:58,917 --> 01:05:00,417
I was about to say that!

671
01:05:00,500 --> 01:05:02,500
Yes, of course.

672
01:05:02,583 --> 01:05:05,042
You'll invite her
to The Best Super Pig Festival and...

673
01:05:05,708 --> 01:05:07,208
A moving reunion!

674
01:05:08,208 --> 01:05:11,250
The best super pig and the adorable
farmer girl forced apart

675
01:05:11,333 --> 01:05:13,625
and somehow brought together on our stage.

676
01:05:13,708 --> 01:05:14,958
Brilliant, Lucy.

677
01:05:15,042 --> 01:05:18,292
An emotional reunion,
and then they leave the stage together.

678
01:05:18,375 --> 01:05:20,583
Hand in hand. Hand in trotter.

679
01:05:21,208 --> 01:05:23,667
She can be the new face
of the Mirando Corporation.

680
01:05:23,750 --> 01:05:26,333
She can be the embodiment
of the Mirando ideal.

681
01:05:26,417 --> 01:05:28,792
She's young, she's pretty, she's female.

682
01:05:28,875 --> 01:05:32,000
She's eco-friendly and she's global!
She's a godsend!

683
01:05:32,083 --> 01:05:34,333
Are you writing this down?

684
01:05:34,417 --> 01:05:35,417
Hey!

685
01:05:39,042 --> 01:05:41,542
She's not the face
of the Mirando Corporation. I am.

686
01:05:43,250 --> 01:05:45,667
You don't even know
if she can do anything but cry.

687
01:05:46,333 --> 01:05:48,375
Whereas I am loved...

688
01:05:50,542 --> 01:05:52,042
all over the world.

689
01:05:52,500 --> 01:05:55,792
Could you sit down and shut
the fucking squeaking and whining?

690
01:06:02,333 --> 01:06:03,417
You know...

691
01:06:06,667 --> 01:06:10,583
you are forcing me...

692
01:06:10,667 --> 01:06:12,583
I'm forcing you to do what?

693
01:06:16,333 --> 01:06:18,833
To examine my options.

694
01:06:18,917 --> 01:06:21,000
Oh, really? Okay.

695
01:06:21,083 --> 01:06:23,000
Go ahead. Examine them.

696
01:06:23,083 --> 01:06:26,625
Are you examining them now?
Have you finished examining them?

697
01:06:28,000 --> 01:06:29,667
Sit. You're a deadbeat.

698
01:06:29,750 --> 01:06:32,875
Your ratings are shit. Epic fail.

699
01:06:33,875 --> 01:06:36,167
Jennifer, get her a first class ticket.

700
01:06:36,250 --> 01:06:39,333
Get her a passport. She probably
hasn't got a passport. Get her a visa.

701
01:06:39,417 --> 01:06:41,708
We'll pay for all the damage
the super pig did in Korea.

702
01:06:41,792 --> 01:06:42,958
Get an attorney on that.

703
01:06:43,042 --> 01:06:46,667
Don't force an image on her,
like Benetton did with those Asian models.

704
01:06:46,750 --> 01:06:49,542
Oh, no. I have a much better idea.

705
01:06:56,542 --> 01:06:59,292
Okay, we got it all figured out.
We got a strategy. We got a plan.

706
01:06:59,375 --> 01:07:01,083
We're gonna think of it like a love story.

707
01:07:01,167 --> 01:07:03,917
<i>That's what we're gonna do.
Hand those bits of paper out quickly.</i>

708
01:07:04,000 --> 01:07:06,160
<i>We got a little girl
running around the city all alone.</i>

709
01:07:06,208 --> 01:07:07,917
<i>We've got a big, big giant pig.</i>

710
01:07:08,000 --> 01:07:10,958
<i>We gotta bring them back together
because they miss each other.</i>

711
01:07:11,042 --> 01:07:12,143
<i>Now they go to New York City.</i>

712
01:07:12,167 --> 01:07:14,333
Look at her, so sweet. Cute.
Totally gorgeous.

713
01:07:14,417 --> 01:07:15,917
Totally sexy. Hot, tiny, perfect.

714
01:07:17,125 --> 01:07:20,958
At this rate,
she'll be doing Mirando commercials.

715
01:07:21,042 --> 01:07:23,417
- It's very likely!
- Thank you!

716
01:07:23,500 --> 01:07:24,958
- Mija!
- Mija.

717
01:07:25,042 --> 01:07:27,208
Everything is worked out!
Don't worry about a thing.

718
01:07:27,292 --> 01:07:29,458
Let's take a photo
for our company Twitter.

719
01:07:29,542 --> 01:07:30,625
Hold this.

720
01:07:33,833 --> 01:07:35,458
Get Okja on the phone now!

721
01:07:35,542 --> 01:07:36,917
I want to know how she's doing.

722
01:07:37,000 --> 01:07:38,542
On the phone? With a pig?

723
01:07:38,625 --> 01:07:41,101
And we gotta tell this
to everybody in New York City!

724
01:07:41,125 --> 01:07:44,208
On Instagram, on YouTube, on Tumblr,
on Facebook, on Twitter.

725
01:07:44,292 --> 01:07:46,458
Okja. Okja, the giant pig.
She's, like, this big.

726
01:07:46,542 --> 01:07:48,062
She's, like, oh, my God. She's bigger.

727
01:07:48,125 --> 01:07:49,750
Yeah, she's got one big, giant nipple.

728
01:07:50,583 --> 01:07:52,625
Hasn't Okja landed yet?

729
01:07:52,708 --> 01:07:54,542
Can we phone her now?

730
01:07:54,625 --> 01:07:56,500
Let's take a picture first, then call her.

731
01:07:56,583 --> 01:07:58,250
- Really?
- Of course.

732
01:08:02,542 --> 01:08:08,292
In the plane…
If you get airsick…

733
01:08:09,458 --> 01:08:11,250
chew the end of this.

734
01:08:11,333 --> 01:08:12,708
Like this, okay?

735
01:08:12,792 --> 01:08:15,375
Look at me.

736
01:08:15,458 --> 01:08:17,167
Mija. Take this.

737
01:08:30,208 --> 01:08:32,417
CONGRATULATIONS!
BEST SUPER PIG COMPETITION

738
01:08:40,125 --> 01:08:43,750
ENGLISH FOR BEGINNERS

739
01:09:01,875 --> 01:09:03,958
Just what I need!

740
01:09:11,708 --> 01:09:12,708
Hey, Nance.

741
01:09:14,083 --> 01:09:17,375
How's London? Is that rain?
That can't be good for the golf.

742
01:09:17,458 --> 01:09:19,208
<i>Just letting you know I'm thinking of you.</i>

743
01:09:19,292 --> 01:09:20,667
<i>You're having a moment, I see.</i>

744
01:09:20,750 --> 01:09:24,750
Yes, things are going super well.
It's all a massive success.

745
01:09:24,833 --> 01:09:26,042
<i>Really?</i>

746
01:09:26,125 --> 01:09:29,917
<i>They keep showing very
unflattering pictures of you in the press.</i>

747
01:09:30,000 --> 01:09:33,792
<i>Those ones of you as a fat child
on Daddy's knee.</i>

748
01:09:33,875 --> 01:09:35,500
<i>Such nasty remarks.</i>

749
01:09:36,250 --> 01:09:39,542
<i>All eyes are on you, aren't they,
squeaky clean icon?</i>

750
01:09:41,167 --> 01:09:43,750
<i>I've sent you a reminder of the true face</i>

751
01:09:43,833 --> 01:09:47,792
<i>of the most powerful CEO
Mirando has ever had.</i>

752
01:09:48,208 --> 01:09:49,208
<i>You go, girl.</i>

753
01:10:02,750 --> 01:10:05,417
Okay. Signal's good.

754
01:10:06,083 --> 01:10:07,500
We're seeing what Okja's seeing.

755
01:10:10,917 --> 01:10:12,583
Enjoy this moment.

756
01:10:12,667 --> 01:10:15,333
Because soon the whole world
will know what we know.

757
01:10:15,917 --> 01:10:19,000
Oh, my God, Jay.
We're about to change everything.

758
01:10:19,083 --> 01:10:21,042
With my shiny antennae.

759
01:10:21,125 --> 01:10:23,125
I'll put some distance
between us and them.

760
01:10:23,708 --> 01:10:25,833
We have to test
how far the signal reaches.

761
01:10:48,958 --> 01:10:52,583
Oh, man. We're really cooking now.

762
01:10:52,667 --> 01:10:54,042
- There she goes.
- Wow.

763
01:10:54,125 --> 01:10:56,375
- Okja gets to see everything.
- Quiet.

764
01:10:56,958 --> 01:10:59,583
This is historical. It's historical.
This is history.

765
01:11:14,833 --> 01:11:17,375
Okja!

766
01:11:22,125 --> 01:11:25,125
Hi! Ah!

767
01:11:26,250 --> 01:11:27,250
Ah!

768
01:11:28,292 --> 01:11:29,625
We're reunited.

769
01:11:30,958 --> 01:11:33,458
In this wretched laboratory, no less.

770
01:11:33,542 --> 01:11:36,083
Someone you're going to find very special.

771
01:11:36,167 --> 01:11:38,792
Here is Alfonso!

772
01:11:40,250 --> 01:11:41,583
Where is he?

773
01:11:41,667 --> 01:11:44,833
I got a special treat
for Lucy's star super pig.

774
01:11:46,792 --> 01:11:48,292
Hey! Chop, chop!

775
01:11:51,792 --> 01:11:54,750
Let me introduce you to someone.

776
01:11:54,833 --> 01:11:57,167
Alfonso, Okja!

777
01:11:57,250 --> 01:12:02,458
Okja, Alfonso! Your boyfriend.

778
01:12:03,333 --> 01:12:04,417
It's all good.

779
01:12:09,542 --> 01:12:11,792
- Come on.
- Are we recording?

780
01:12:11,875 --> 01:12:12,875
Yeah.

781
01:12:21,958 --> 01:12:23,333
Oh, my God.

782
01:12:36,833 --> 01:12:38,917
We should never have sent her there.

783
01:12:39,000 --> 01:12:40,667
Can you turn it off, please?

784
01:12:42,250 --> 01:12:43,250
No.

785
01:12:43,958 --> 01:12:47,125
No, we need to record this.
We need to show this.

786
01:12:47,958 --> 01:12:49,625
At least turn the volume down.

787
01:12:51,500 --> 01:12:54,708
- We knowingly sent her to that hellhole.
- No, we didn't.

788
01:12:54,792 --> 01:12:56,875
We didn't know
they were gonna do this to her.

789
01:12:56,958 --> 01:12:59,583
We didn't know they were gonna
put her through this mating.

790
01:12:59,667 --> 01:13:00,792
We suspected!

791
01:13:01,833 --> 01:13:03,750
Come on, we all suspected.

792
01:13:04,833 --> 01:13:06,667
Turn it off!

793
01:13:15,250 --> 01:13:16,708
I know it's painful.

794
01:13:18,292 --> 01:13:19,750
But we can't be weak.

795
01:13:19,833 --> 01:13:20,833
That's right.

796
01:13:21,667 --> 01:13:24,500
This is why we need to stay focused.

797
01:13:24,583 --> 01:13:26,417
This is why we need
to stick to the mission.

798
01:13:26,500 --> 01:13:30,167
The little girl trusted us with Okja.
We have to respect her bravery.

799
01:13:30,250 --> 01:13:31,958
She never agreed to send Okja.

800
01:13:33,750 --> 01:13:34,958
What'd you just say?

801
01:13:38,833 --> 01:13:40,250
She was in our truck.

802
01:13:41,458 --> 01:13:43,667
She said...

803
01:13:44,042 --> 01:13:46,667
"I wanna take Okja back
to the mountains."

804
01:13:48,542 --> 01:13:49,583
I lied.

805
01:13:52,917 --> 01:13:54,833
- God.
- Why did you lie?

806
01:13:56,042 --> 01:13:58,917
I don't know.
In that moment, it's just... I couldn't...

807
01:14:00,542 --> 01:14:02,125
I couldn't stop the mission.

808
01:14:02,917 --> 01:14:06,042
You know, this is...
this is the coolest mission ever.

809
01:14:06,125 --> 01:14:08,333
- I have all this stuff and...
- Hey, K... K.

810
01:14:10,500 --> 01:14:11,875
It's okay.

811
01:14:15,833 --> 01:14:17,625
I hold you dear to my heart,

812
01:14:17,708 --> 01:14:20,167
but you have dishonored
the 40-year history

813
01:14:20,250 --> 01:14:23,708
and meaningful legacy
of the Animal Liberation Front.

814
01:14:23,792 --> 01:14:28,417
You have betrayed the great minds
and brave fighters that have preceded you.

815
01:14:29,792 --> 01:14:31,125
Never mistranslate.

816
01:14:33,750 --> 01:14:35,458
Translation is sacred.

817
01:14:38,542 --> 01:14:39,750
From this moment on...

818
01:14:41,167 --> 01:14:45,042
you are no longer a member of the ALF.
You are permanently banned.

819
01:14:47,042 --> 01:14:48,042
Get out.

820
01:14:49,458 --> 01:14:50,583
However...

821
01:14:52,000 --> 01:14:54,917
since it is vital that we continue
with our mission...

822
01:14:55,625 --> 01:14:58,458
we will return your equipment to you
after its completion.

823
01:14:58,542 --> 01:15:02,000
Consider this your final contribution
to the ALF.

824
01:15:11,625 --> 01:15:13,583
Ah, shit.

825
01:15:13,917 --> 01:15:15,500
Oh, my God.

826
01:15:19,333 --> 01:15:20,417
You want some?

827
01:15:28,458 --> 01:15:30,375
It'll make you feel better.

828
01:15:48,083 --> 01:15:52,250
This is an unspeakable place.

829
01:15:55,417 --> 01:15:57,917
I know. I know.

830
01:16:02,958 --> 01:16:04,917
There are worse rooms out there.

831
01:16:07,333 --> 01:16:10,917
Lucy Mirando says
I'm not supposed to harm you in here.

832
01:16:11,000 --> 01:16:13,125
Well, at least not visibly.

833
01:16:13,208 --> 01:16:17,292
She wants you perfect
for her big telecast!

834
01:16:18,667 --> 01:16:19,667
But...

835
01:16:22,875 --> 01:16:26,917
when a woman humiliates a man

836
01:16:27,000 --> 01:16:29,333
in front of his own colleagues,

837
01:16:29,417 --> 01:16:33,708
a man is inclined
to make his own decisions.

838
01:16:39,250 --> 01:16:41,875
This is nothing, really.

839
01:16:41,958 --> 01:16:45,208
It's used on beef. I mean, live cows.

840
01:16:45,875 --> 01:16:47,417
To check their marbling.

841
01:16:54,000 --> 01:16:56,208
Hi, Dr. Johnny. Is Okja with you?

842
01:16:56,292 --> 01:16:57,208
Yes!

843
01:16:57,292 --> 01:17:00,708
<i>Our precious farmer princess insists
that she speaks to her on the phone.</i>

844
01:17:00,792 --> 01:17:01,792
What?

845
01:17:02,292 --> 01:17:05,252
Whatever. She says you should lift
her ear and put the receiver underneath.

846
01:17:05,625 --> 01:17:08,042
- You're on speakerphone!
- Okja!

847
01:17:08,125 --> 01:17:09,292
<i>Okja!</i>

848
01:17:12,083 --> 01:17:13,250
<i>Okja! Are you okay?</i>

849
01:17:13,333 --> 01:17:15,542
Okja! Okja! What did you say?

850
01:17:15,625 --> 01:17:16,875
I can't hear you!

851
01:17:16,958 --> 01:17:19,500
<i>Okja! Okja!</i>

852
01:17:19,583 --> 01:17:21,167
<i>Okja! Are you okay?</i>

853
01:17:43,833 --> 01:17:45,542
Bang! Sirloin.

854
01:17:49,542 --> 01:17:50,542
Ooh!

855
01:17:51,083 --> 01:17:52,125
The shank.

856
01:17:53,792 --> 01:17:57,000
Don't worry. You won't die.

857
01:17:58,167 --> 01:18:00,458
We're just gonna take some of your meat.

858
01:18:01,792 --> 01:18:05,708
And of course, I'm not gonna eat any.

859
01:18:06,958 --> 01:18:08,833
We have tasters for that.

860
01:18:09,625 --> 01:18:13,292
They're a bunch of half-wit,
degenerate fucktards!

861
01:18:17,958 --> 01:18:22,125
I'm gonna...
I'm gonna poke you in five places.

862
01:18:22,708 --> 01:18:26,167
And I'm sorry. It's gonna hurt.

863
01:18:27,792 --> 01:18:29,458
I shouldn't be here.

864
01:18:34,042 --> 01:18:37,083
I'm an animal lover.

865
01:18:38,250 --> 01:18:40,625
Everybody knows that about me!

866
01:18:55,583 --> 01:18:56,583
Tasty.

867
01:18:58,708 --> 01:18:59,958
Fuck, yeah.

868
01:19:00,042 --> 01:19:04,542
That was the best I've ever had.
The best of the best.

869
01:19:10,167 --> 01:19:15,792
<i>Today Mirando presents to you
our super gourmet sausage.</i>

870
01:19:16,417 --> 01:19:19,292
<i>Juicy like you've never tasted before.</i>

871
01:19:19,917 --> 01:19:23,500
<i>An exquisite taste
with a very affordable price!</i>

872
01:19:23,583 --> 01:19:29,000
<i>Made fresh from our naturally-grown,
Grade A super pigs.</i>

873
01:19:29,083 --> 01:19:32,000
<i>Very healthy! Come and try!</i>

874
01:19:32,083 --> 01:19:33,309
Pink streamers, pink fireworks.

875
01:19:33,333 --> 01:19:34,976
Lucy's gonna be happy.
I'm gonna get my bonus.

876
01:19:35,000 --> 01:19:36,708
I'm gonna be...
What the hell is this?

877
01:19:36,792 --> 01:19:39,625
That's Lucy's autograph.
"Designed by Lucy Mirando."

878
01:19:39,708 --> 01:19:42,125
Oh! She can't get enough of herself,
can she?

879
01:19:42,875 --> 01:19:45,333
Hey! Oh, how's everyone doing?

880
01:19:45,417 --> 01:19:47,917
Still with this thing.
It looks super tacky.

881
01:19:48,000 --> 01:19:49,080
Don't touch it!

882
01:19:49,125 --> 01:19:50,226
Don't touch it.

883
01:19:50,250 --> 01:19:52,375
Okay, okay. The fanny pack is fine.

884
01:19:53,042 --> 01:19:54,976
I think she understands some English.

885
01:19:55,000 --> 01:19:56,542
So we should be careful what we say.

886
01:19:56,625 --> 01:19:59,042
Yes, yes, everything is fine.

887
01:19:59,125 --> 01:20:01,000
But you have to wear this.

888
01:20:01,083 --> 01:20:05,500
Oh, it's a special edition,
custom-made, just for you.

889
01:20:05,583 --> 01:20:08,625
Look. The CEO even autographed it.

890
01:20:08,708 --> 01:20:10,083
Boop! Totally rad, right?

891
01:20:10,167 --> 01:20:11,667
Wow. Hmm?

892
01:20:11,750 --> 01:20:12,958
Now, let's put it on.

893
01:20:14,000 --> 01:20:15,375
Not until I see Okja.

894
01:20:15,958 --> 01:20:19,417
Mija... Oh!
Think about how dramatic it will be.

895
01:20:19,500 --> 01:20:22,417
Okja...
Okja doesn't even know you're here.

896
01:20:22,500 --> 01:20:26,000
If you show up on stage
without telling her,

897
01:20:26,083 --> 01:20:28,042
it'll be such a great surprise.

898
01:20:28,625 --> 01:20:30,083
You know? Surprise?

899
01:20:30,167 --> 01:20:31,625
I don't care about that.

900
01:20:31,708 --> 01:20:34,500
I want to see Okja first.
Or I won't cooperate.

901
01:20:35,292 --> 01:20:37,042
- Mija...
- She said no.

902
01:20:37,125 --> 01:20:40,625
Mija. Mija, I don't think
you understand this situation.

903
01:20:42,542 --> 01:20:45,417
No, no, no.
We are the ones who have Okja. Okay?

904
01:20:45,500 --> 01:20:47,792
We are doing you a favor.
Do you get it now?

905
01:20:49,375 --> 01:20:52,375
Yep, yep, yep.
You want to go back home with Okja, right?

906
01:20:52,958 --> 01:20:54,625
Then do as you're told.

907
01:20:54,708 --> 01:20:58,375
Otherwise,
this is what will happen to Okja.

908
01:21:00,875 --> 01:21:01,875
Put it on.

909
01:21:03,667 --> 01:21:05,500
The turnout's looking good,
don't you think?

910
01:21:05,583 --> 01:21:08,303
- Lucy must be thrilled.
- Yeah. Tell me about it.

911
01:21:08,375 --> 01:21:09,583
All eyes on her.

912
01:21:09,667 --> 01:21:11,307
Thinks it's her own fashion show.

913
01:21:18,375 --> 01:21:19,375
Mija.

914
01:21:20,208 --> 01:21:22,417
It's me.

915
01:21:23,708 --> 01:21:24,708
Jay.

916
01:21:28,250 --> 01:21:30,542
Oh, shut up!

917
01:23:39,542 --> 01:23:42,042
Oh, man, this is so good, man.
You gotta try this.

918
01:23:42,125 --> 01:23:43,458
It's actually really good.

919
01:23:49,375 --> 01:23:51,625
Good day, all. Thank you very much.

920
01:23:52,958 --> 01:23:54,875
These are for you.

921
01:23:54,958 --> 01:23:56,583
Oh! Thanks, Frank.

922
01:23:58,292 --> 01:24:01,000
Ten years.
An extraordinary accomplishment.

923
01:24:01,083 --> 01:24:04,833
Ten years, finally coming to fruition.

924
01:24:06,083 --> 01:24:08,792
You have to try one of these.
They're completely delicious.

925
01:24:17,000 --> 01:24:18,000
Delicious.

926
01:24:20,667 --> 01:24:21,667
Beautiful.

927
01:24:21,750 --> 01:24:23,583
- Mmm!
- Mmm.

928
01:24:23,667 --> 01:24:24,917
Mmm.

929
01:24:26,000 --> 01:24:27,250
Mmm.

930
01:24:34,208 --> 01:24:37,625
Such a shame we had to tell
all those little white lies.

931
01:24:40,250 --> 01:24:45,375
It's not our fault that the consumers
are so paranoid about GM foods.

932
01:24:52,167 --> 01:24:53,917
These are really beautiful.

933
01:24:54,000 --> 01:24:55,542
Oh!

934
01:24:55,625 --> 01:24:58,417
Your taste is as impeccable as always.

935
01:24:58,500 --> 01:24:59,625
Oh.

936
01:25:00,292 --> 01:25:02,500
Well, the flowers aren't actually from me.

937
01:25:02,583 --> 01:25:03,583
Oh?

938
01:25:04,833 --> 01:25:07,375
- Are they from Nancy?
- Yes.

939
01:25:08,000 --> 01:25:09,708
Nancy's here. Not in London.

940
01:25:10,833 --> 01:25:12,333
She's here? In New York?

941
01:25:13,625 --> 01:25:14,708
Fuck Nancy.

942
01:25:15,417 --> 01:25:17,875
- She's been here a while.
- I told you to keep her away!

943
01:25:17,958 --> 01:25:19,583
She frightens people!

944
01:25:20,167 --> 01:25:21,708
You frighten people, too, Lucy.

945
01:25:24,042 --> 01:25:27,375
Yeah, but she really frightens people.
She reminds them of Daddy.

946
01:25:36,125 --> 01:25:38,833
This is mine. This is my project.

947
01:25:39,500 --> 01:25:42,000
She just wants to support you
on your special day.

948
01:25:43,625 --> 01:25:44,792
Is she watching me?

949
01:25:50,792 --> 01:25:52,958
Johnny's in the house!
Johnny's in the house!

950
01:25:53,542 --> 01:25:55,333
Whoo, whoo, whoo!

951
01:25:56,000 --> 01:25:58,667
- Yes!
- We love you, Johnny!

952
01:26:02,208 --> 01:26:03,375
Yeah!

953
01:26:04,125 --> 01:26:05,875
Whoo, whoo, whoo!

954
01:26:06,667 --> 01:26:08,250
Johnny!

955
01:26:11,583 --> 01:26:14,667
Dr. Johnny's...

956
01:26:14,750 --> 01:26:17,000
Magical Animals!

957
01:26:18,417 --> 01:26:22,542
Everybody knows
Dr. Johnny can't stand anything boring!

958
01:26:22,625 --> 01:26:24,292
No!

959
01:26:24,375 --> 01:26:28,375
- Have I ever given you a boring show?
- No!

960
01:26:30,083 --> 01:26:32,167
Who's ready?

961
01:26:40,292 --> 01:26:45,750
Ten years ago,
26 farmers from lands far away

962
01:26:45,833 --> 01:26:49,042
were each given a magical super piglet.

963
01:26:49,958 --> 01:26:53,458
This year, I met these wonderful people,

964
01:26:53,542 --> 01:26:57,083
to decide which super piglet
would have the honor of being invited

965
01:26:57,167 --> 01:26:59,167
to this prestigious occasion.

966
01:27:01,500 --> 01:27:04,250
Are you ready to meet
the winner of this contest?

967
01:27:04,333 --> 01:27:06,375
Yeah!

968
01:27:06,458 --> 01:27:10,000
The best super pig
on the face of the Earth?

969
01:27:10,083 --> 01:27:11,667
Yeah!

970
01:27:11,750 --> 01:27:17,250
Are you ready?

971
01:27:17,333 --> 01:27:20,000
Well, I'm afraid you're gonna
have to meet somebody else first.

972
01:27:20,083 --> 01:27:21,875
Isn't that the way it always is?

973
01:27:21,958 --> 01:27:24,038
Before you meet the talent,
you gotta meet the suits.

974
01:27:24,958 --> 01:27:26,833
I'm just kidding. I'm just kidding.

975
01:27:28,958 --> 01:27:31,417
She is an amazing little lady...

976
01:27:32,250 --> 01:27:37,375
and she happens to be the brain
behind this entire super pig project!

977
01:27:38,500 --> 01:27:42,458
Ladies and gentlemen,
put your hands together

978
01:27:42,542 --> 01:27:45,208
for the one, the only,

979
01:27:45,292 --> 01:27:48,250
Lucy Mirando!

980
01:28:00,208 --> 01:28:02,792
"Lucy Mirando!"

981
01:28:04,792 --> 01:28:05,792
Fucking idiot.

982
01:28:06,333 --> 01:28:08,208
You look amazing!

983
01:28:11,833 --> 01:28:12,958
Oh, Johnny.

984
01:28:13,042 --> 01:28:17,083
You're skating on thin ice.
Watch out you don't fall in and drown.

985
01:28:17,167 --> 01:28:19,375
Don't worry.
I'm not here to put you to sleep

986
01:28:19,458 --> 01:28:22,500
with some corporate speech
like my boring sister might have.

987
01:28:23,708 --> 01:28:25,000
Yeah, there it is!

988
01:28:25,083 --> 01:28:26,833
Go on, Lucy!

989
01:28:27,500 --> 01:28:29,167
Lucy, we love you!

990
01:28:30,417 --> 01:28:35,583
No. I'm here to introduce you
to a real superstar.

991
01:28:36,292 --> 01:28:40,667
Maybe you've already seen her on YouTube,
enjoying her little shopping spree

992
01:28:40,750 --> 01:28:43,583
in that underground mall in Seoul!

993
01:28:43,667 --> 01:28:47,708
So let's all welcome
an extraordinary little girl.

994
01:28:47,792 --> 01:28:51,542
A local farmer
who raised her beloved super pig

995
01:28:51,625 --> 01:28:54,625
in wild and beautiful nature.

996
01:28:55,208 --> 01:28:59,208
The fearless pig rider
from across the globe!

997
01:28:59,292 --> 01:29:00,500
Please welcome...

998
01:29:01,458 --> 01:29:02,458
Mija!

999
01:29:12,958 --> 01:29:17,333
And here she is! Our ultimate super pig!

1000
01:29:17,417 --> 01:29:18,875
Okja!

1001
01:30:22,042 --> 01:30:23,792
Okja! Okja!

1002
01:30:27,708 --> 01:30:29,792
Hey, get her off the stage!

1003
01:30:31,000 --> 01:30:32,000
Okja!

1004
01:30:38,417 --> 01:30:40,083
Come on. Now!

1005
01:30:40,167 --> 01:30:42,292
Good. Here's Johnny!

1006
01:30:48,167 --> 01:30:49,625
Mija!

1007
01:30:51,583 --> 01:30:52,875
Don't look back.

1008
01:30:57,458 --> 01:30:58,667
Just look at me.

1009
01:30:59,583 --> 01:31:03,083
Turn it off! Turn it... Kill the screen!

1010
01:31:03,167 --> 01:31:05,833
<i>I'm an animal lover.</i>

1011
01:31:07,833 --> 01:31:08,833
Stop it!

1012
01:31:13,458 --> 01:31:14,458
Go!

1013
01:31:17,250 --> 01:31:21,625
Save that pig!
Save that pig! Save that pig!

1014
01:31:21,708 --> 01:31:24,417
No! No, no, no! No! No!

1015
01:31:27,500 --> 01:31:31,750
I promise... No, I pledge,
to learn everything I can,

1016
01:31:31,833 --> 01:31:33,875
everything from this situation...

1017
01:31:38,250 --> 01:31:40,351
For more details and shocking proof

1018
01:31:40,375 --> 01:31:43,500
of Mirando's crimes
against humanity and animals,

1019
01:31:43,583 --> 01:31:47,000
go to YouTube and search
"Mirando is fucked."

1020
01:31:47,083 --> 01:31:49,667
That's right, folks. Go to YouTube now

1021
01:31:49,750 --> 01:31:55,250
and search "Mirando is F-U-C-K-E-D."

1022
01:31:55,958 --> 01:31:56,958
Fucked!

1023
01:32:09,000 --> 01:32:10,667
I don't think we have a choice, Nancy.

1024
01:32:11,958 --> 01:32:13,208
You have to go out there.

1025
01:32:14,833 --> 01:32:16,083
You don't say.

1026
01:32:19,333 --> 01:32:21,083
What a clusterfuck.

1027
01:32:22,167 --> 01:32:24,375
Let's get private security in there.

1028
01:32:25,917 --> 01:32:26,792
Black Chalk.

1029
01:32:26,875 --> 01:32:29,125
We're on good terms
with the NYPD, correct?

1030
01:32:29,208 --> 01:32:30,500
<i>Hundred percent.</i>

1031
01:32:30,583 --> 01:32:32,000
<i>We have an arrangement.</i>

1032
01:32:38,250 --> 01:32:39,500
Okja! No!

1033
01:32:53,167 --> 01:32:54,625
Black Chalk!

1034
01:33:47,792 --> 01:33:50,032
- Let's go. Come on!
- You okay?

1035
01:33:52,750 --> 01:33:55,083
- Blond! Let's move!
- Go, go, go!

1036
01:33:57,083 --> 01:33:58,167
Come here, come here.

1037
01:33:59,625 --> 01:34:01,458
Red, let's go.

1038
01:34:01,542 --> 01:34:02,542
Move!

1039
01:34:05,042 --> 01:34:06,976
- Where's the truck?
- Up to the right!

1040
01:34:07,000 --> 01:34:08,542
More Black Chalk! Hurry!

1041
01:34:08,792 --> 01:34:09,875
Take 'em down!

1042
01:34:27,167 --> 01:34:29,000
Move! Move!

1043
01:34:30,292 --> 01:34:31,292
Go!

1044
01:35:59,083 --> 01:36:03,625
Well, good luck
with clearing up my mess, twinny.

1045
01:36:06,292 --> 01:36:09,833
Well, for a while back then,
you forgot you were such a loser.

1046
01:36:24,042 --> 01:36:26,958
I mean, Daddy was a terrible man.

1047
01:36:28,292 --> 01:36:29,625
He was a real horror.

1048
01:36:31,875 --> 01:36:35,042
But, by God, did he know about business.

1049
01:36:41,333 --> 01:36:43,917
Don't worry about your apology speech,
twinny.

1050
01:36:44,000 --> 01:36:46,250
I'll pretend to be you
in front of the press.

1051
01:36:46,333 --> 01:36:48,792
Ah! The police.

1052
01:36:49,458 --> 01:36:52,138
You'll understand that I will be
instructing our corporate attorneys

1053
01:36:52,208 --> 01:36:54,333
not to assist you in any way.

1054
01:36:54,417 --> 01:36:55,417
Frank.

1055
01:36:58,292 --> 01:37:01,875
- Zero delay on the distribution plan.
- Of course.

1056
01:37:01,958 --> 01:37:05,000
Scrap Lucy's precious
promotional marketing crap.

1057
01:37:05,083 --> 01:37:08,875
- Tell everyone ASAP.
- Definitely.

1058
01:37:08,958 --> 01:37:11,417
We already have FDA approval, correct?

1059
01:37:11,500 --> 01:37:15,333
Yes, we do. But I'm not sure
how the customers will react after today.

1060
01:37:15,417 --> 01:37:17,042
If it's cheap, they'll eat it.

1061
01:37:17,125 --> 01:37:19,792
I guarantee early sales will be strong.

1062
01:37:20,375 --> 01:37:22,792
Shut down the lab as already discussed.

1063
01:37:22,875 --> 01:37:25,417
We'll visit the production facility
later tonight.

1064
01:37:25,500 --> 01:37:27,583
Get all the execs there,
even the ones on vacation.

1065
01:37:27,667 --> 01:37:29,125
Put all the pigs into production.

1066
01:37:29,750 --> 01:37:31,333
Even the best super pig?

1067
01:37:31,417 --> 01:37:33,458
Every last one of them.

1068
01:37:44,167 --> 01:37:47,125
- You okay?
- K...

1069
01:37:47,208 --> 01:37:48,458
What are you doing?

1070
01:37:55,333 --> 01:37:56,375
Okja...

1071
01:37:57,458 --> 01:37:58,667
We need to hurry.

1072
01:38:04,417 --> 01:38:06,417
Look, I'm just saying that
if I call you one time,

1073
01:38:06,500 --> 01:38:08,768
I like for you to pick up the first time,
know what I mean?

1074
01:38:08,792 --> 01:38:11,958
Like, I have a friend here
who's incredibly sick.

1075
01:38:13,917 --> 01:38:16,375
Are you even certified?
Do you know what you're doing?

1076
01:38:17,542 --> 01:38:19,917
The guy's bleeding out!
Do you know what you're doing?

1077
01:38:38,125 --> 01:38:40,917
Mija, are you okay?

1078
01:38:48,708 --> 01:38:50,250
She wants to know where we're going.

1079
01:38:54,875 --> 01:38:55,958
We're going to Okja.

1080
01:38:56,667 --> 01:38:57,667
Okja?

1081
01:38:59,708 --> 01:39:03,708
Yes, but you should know
the situation is not good.

1082
01:39:05,250 --> 01:39:06,458
What is it?

1083
01:39:07,333 --> 01:39:09,833
I didn't... There is no other way.

1084
01:39:14,167 --> 01:39:16,333
I wish you didn't have to see this.

1085
01:39:16,417 --> 01:39:18,375
Just tell me where she is!

1086
01:39:25,500 --> 01:39:27,958
We are going to need your help. Mija...

1087
01:39:32,375 --> 01:39:33,625
Ah!

1088
01:39:47,333 --> 01:39:48,542
Okja.

1089
01:39:48,625 --> 01:39:49,792
Wait! Mija!

1090
01:39:54,708 --> 01:39:56,417
Okja!

1091
01:39:56,500 --> 01:39:58,000
Okja!

1092
01:39:58,083 --> 01:40:01,583
- Okja! Okja!
- Okja!

1093
01:40:02,250 --> 01:40:04,250
- Okja!
- Okja!

1094
01:40:04,333 --> 01:40:05,583
Okja!

1095
01:40:05,667 --> 01:40:07,833
- Okja!
- Okja!

1096
01:40:08,292 --> 01:40:10,208
Okja!

1097
01:40:10,292 --> 01:40:11,500
- Okja!
- Okja!

1098
01:40:11,583 --> 01:40:14,792
Emergency, emergency.
We have intruders in section A-24!

1099
01:40:14,875 --> 01:40:15,875
Come on.

1100
01:40:16,625 --> 01:40:17,667
I'm so sorry.

1101
01:40:17,750 --> 01:40:21,250
This is nonlethal.
This is a nonlethal choke hold, okay?

1102
01:40:21,333 --> 01:40:24,750
All right, you're gonna be fine.
You're gonna be fine. Okay?

1103
01:40:25,292 --> 01:40:28,833
Six minutes, 45 seconds
before Black Chalk arrive!

1104
01:40:30,208 --> 01:40:31,833
This is our last chance.

1105
01:40:41,042 --> 01:40:43,458
- Okja!
- Okja!

1106
01:40:44,500 --> 01:40:46,167
Okja!

1107
01:40:49,625 --> 01:40:50,917
Okja!

1108
01:40:54,250 --> 01:40:56,333
No! Don't go inside!

1109
01:41:45,500 --> 01:41:46,500
Hey!

1110
01:43:02,000 --> 01:43:03,042
Okja.

1111
01:43:05,833 --> 01:43:06,833
Okja!

1112
01:43:07,500 --> 01:43:08,583
No!

1113
01:43:15,833 --> 01:43:17,917
- Okja...
- Wait.

1114
01:43:23,792 --> 01:43:26,059
- This what caused the alarm?
- I believe so.

1115
01:43:26,083 --> 01:43:29,208
I'm flummoxed that security is so lax
as to allow a bunch of hooligans

1116
01:43:29,292 --> 01:43:31,208
to delay the production line,
even for a second.

1117
01:43:31,292 --> 01:43:34,750
It won't happen again. Please note
that Black Chalk was here exactly on time.

1118
01:43:34,833 --> 01:43:37,833
- No, guys, guys, this is...
- Please, don't touch her!

1119
01:43:37,917 --> 01:43:40,667
- Sir! Sir, put the gun down. It's okay.
- Stop! Less violence!

1120
01:43:40,750 --> 01:43:41,917
No! No violence!

1121
01:43:42,000 --> 01:43:45,500
Isn't this Lucy's beloved
fearless pig rider?

1122
01:43:45,583 --> 01:43:49,875
She is. And that's our best super pig.

1123
01:43:49,958 --> 01:43:51,292
Well, what's the hiccup?

1124
01:43:52,208 --> 01:43:53,708
Why is it still alive?

1125
01:43:54,375 --> 01:43:56,042
Why you want to kill Okja?

1126
01:43:56,792 --> 01:43:58,958
Well, we can only sell the dead ones.

1127
01:44:00,625 --> 01:44:03,917
I wanna go home with Okja.

1128
01:44:04,000 --> 01:44:06,583
No, it's my property.

1129
01:44:06,667 --> 01:44:10,042
- You're a fucking psychopath.
- You should be ashamed of yourself.

1130
01:44:10,125 --> 01:44:13,208
Fuck off! We're extremely proud
of our achievements.

1131
01:44:13,292 --> 01:44:15,167
We're very hardworking businesspeople.

1132
01:44:15,250 --> 01:44:18,208
We do deals,
and these are the deals we do.

1133
01:44:18,958 --> 01:44:22,083
This is the tenderloin
for the sophisticated restaurants.

1134
01:44:22,167 --> 01:44:25,375
The Mexicans love the feet.
I know. Go figure!

1135
01:44:25,458 --> 01:44:30,792
We all love the face and the anus,
as American as apple pie! Hot dogs.

1136
01:44:30,875 --> 01:44:34,458
It's all edible.
All edible, except the squeal.

1137
01:44:36,250 --> 01:44:39,958
- So you're the other Mirando.
- And you are?

1138
01:44:41,250 --> 01:44:43,583
- Let Mija and Okja go.
- Why?

1139
01:44:44,792 --> 01:44:46,625
You already have a shitload of money.

1140
01:44:47,208 --> 01:44:49,625
- Please.
- This is business.

1141
01:44:49,708 --> 01:44:53,625
Hey, Nancy!
I hold all creatures dear to my heart,

1142
01:44:53,708 --> 01:44:56,250
but you are crying out to be an exception.

1143
01:44:57,083 --> 01:44:58,083
Mija!

1144
01:44:58,625 --> 01:45:00,125
Oh, okay.

1145
01:45:03,125 --> 01:45:04,417
<i>Terminálo.</i>

1146
01:45:05,833 --> 01:45:07,083
No, wait!

1147
01:45:18,583 --> 01:45:21,708
I want to buy Okja... alive.

1148
01:45:58,542 --> 01:45:59,958
Hmm.

1149
01:46:00,042 --> 01:46:01,250
Very nice.

1150
01:46:02,792 --> 01:46:04,167
We have a deal.

1151
01:46:04,250 --> 01:46:06,083
This thing is worth a lot of money.

1152
01:46:06,167 --> 01:46:09,000
Make sure our customer
and her purchase get home safely.

1153
01:46:09,083 --> 01:46:12,917
Our first ever Mirando super pig sale.
Pleasure doing business with you.

1154
01:46:13,000 --> 01:46:14,625
<i>Libéralo.</i>

1155
01:49:48,167 --> 01:49:49,542
Did you pick a lot?

1156
01:49:49,625 --> 01:49:50,625
Yes.

1157
01:49:55,500 --> 01:49:57,083
Don't scare the chickens.

1158
01:59:24,292 --> 01:59:27,208
It's gonna be big.
Record-breaking.

1159
01:59:28,625 --> 01:59:31,333
Lot of folks flying in
from Midwest and Canada.

1160
01:59:31,417 --> 01:59:32,417
Good.

1161
01:59:33,458 --> 01:59:35,167
Oh, let me introduce you to a new member.

1162
01:59:35,250 --> 01:59:36,250
Hey.

1163
01:59:38,667 --> 01:59:41,875
He runs Mirandoisfucked.com.
Just got in from Seoul.

1164
01:59:41,958 --> 01:59:43,792
- Hi. What's your name?
- Red.

1165
01:59:43,875 --> 01:59:46,000
Red. Oh, it's because of your hair?

1166
01:59:46,083 --> 01:59:48,792
Hey. Quit bugging her.

1167
01:59:50,958 --> 01:59:52,199
He's a chatty one.

1168
01:59:52,250 --> 01:59:54,167
I'm assuming Mirando bigwigs
will be there?

1169
01:59:54,833 --> 01:59:57,042
- Of course.
- Mirandoisfucked.com.

1170
01:59:57,125 --> 01:59:59,250
Including Nancy Mirando.

1171
02:00:08,750 --> 02:00:09,750
There it is.
