<i>This way, mister.</i>

23
00:03:05,937 --> 00:03:07,689
Let me go home

24
00:03:07,856 --> 00:03:12,443
You know what it means
to come to this side of the gate

25
00:03:13,111 --> 00:03:16,281
- I'm going home
- Come inside, quick

26
00:03:59,073 --> 00:04:00,658
Oharu?

27
00:04:01,826 --> 00:04:04,537
You couldn't find
a customer either?

28
00:04:05,288 --> 00:04:09,542
A woman of 50
can't make herself look 20

29
00:04:10,168 --> 00:04:13,004
If you feel that way,
imagine how the rest of us feel

30
00:04:13,171 --> 00:04:16,841
An old man took me
to an inn for pilgrims

31
00:04:17,842 --> 00:04:20,386
I was glad
to get some business,

32
00:04:20,553 --> 00:04:22,472
so I went along

33
00:04:22,639 --> 00:04:26,059
Some pilgrims were gathered
He held a candle up to my face

34
00:04:26,225 --> 00:04:28,019
A candle?

35
00:04:28,269 --> 00:04:30,813
Then he said
to the young men there

36
00:04:32,565 --> 00:04:34,859
"Look how she tries
to hide her age!

37
00:04:35,026 --> 00:04:38,905
Would you sleep
with a woman like this?"

38
00:04:40,198 --> 00:04:44,160
I think he was giving them
a lesson in karmic retribution

39
00:04:45,036 --> 00:04:47,914
You're off
to a bad start tonight

40
00:04:48,790 --> 00:04:52,418
Look, the old man's
making a fire again

41
00:04:52,543 --> 00:04:54,879
Let's warm up
before heading home

42
00:05:16,901 --> 00:05:19,612
Old man, let us get warm

43
00:05:31,749 --> 00:05:34,210
You used to serve
in the imperial court

44
00:05:34,377 --> 00:05:39,132
Did you ever think
you'd end up like this?

45
00:05:45,471 --> 00:05:48,599
How did you fall so far?

46
00:05:50,560 --> 00:05:53,730
Please don't ask about my past

47
00:05:57,483 --> 00:05:59,110
<i>Hey!</i>

48
00:06:03,781 --> 00:06:06,034
Making fires again!

49
00:06:08,202 --> 00:06:11,456
I guess it's all right,
but be very careful

50
00:06:11,622 --> 00:06:13,124
We will

51
00:06:13,291 --> 00:06:15,626
Don't worry so much
or you'll go —

52
00:06:15,793 --> 00:06:17,712
Oh, I guess
it's too late to go bald

53
00:11:06,667 --> 00:11:08,669
Where are you going
in such finery?

54
00:11:08,794 --> 00:11:15,343
To make an offering at the temple
on behalf of my master

55
00:11:15,468 --> 00:11:17,386
That's good of you

56
00:11:17,553 --> 00:11:20,973
You should see the sights too,
since you so rarely get out

57
00:11:21,140 --> 00:11:23,601
I'd be scolded if I did that

58
00:11:23,768 --> 00:11:27,188
Not at all Just pretend
you didn't know any better

59
00:11:30,024 --> 00:11:33,444
You're going home early,
Lord Kikunokoji

60
00:11:34,653 --> 00:11:36,197
I almost forgot

61
00:11:36,364 --> 00:11:40,993
Nishinotoin is anxious
for your reply to his poem

62
00:11:41,118 --> 00:11:46,165
He can't keep anything
a secret, can he?

63
00:11:46,290 --> 00:11:49,627
It seems his poem
was rather forward

64
00:11:49,794 --> 00:11:51,087
What did it say?

65
00:11:51,253 --> 00:11:53,130
I don't know

66
00:11:53,589 --> 00:11:55,424
Please excuse me

67
00:12:28,666 --> 00:12:31,752
Wait! Please wait!

68
00:12:34,171 --> 00:12:35,923
Please wait!

69
00:12:40,094 --> 00:12:42,346
My name is Katsunosuke

70
00:12:45,015 --> 00:12:48,060
Lord Kikunokoji begs your indulgence
to discuss a certain matter

71
00:12:48,227 --> 00:12:52,690
Might I ask you to call at the house
of his friend in Teramachi?

72
00:12:52,982 --> 00:12:56,735
I'm sorry, but I've been sent
to the temple on an errand

73
00:12:56,902 --> 00:12:59,738
Then perhaps
on your way home

74
00:12:59,905 --> 00:13:03,534
We would be deeply grateful
for just a moment of your time

75
00:14:08,057 --> 00:14:09,767
Lady Oharu

76
00:14:17,358 --> 00:14:21,111
Did you read the letter
I sent the other day?

77
00:14:21,403 --> 00:14:23,405
Of course not

78
00:14:23,531 --> 00:14:26,283
Who would read a letter
from a lowly retainer?

79
00:14:26,450 --> 00:14:29,578
I burned it
without reading a word

80
00:14:34,124 --> 00:14:38,045
I have no talent
for composing verse

81
00:14:38,170 --> 00:14:40,923
I lack the wit
even to tell jokes well

82
00:14:41,840 --> 00:14:45,302
But my heart is true

83
00:14:46,095 --> 00:14:49,515
You can look down
upon my low rank,

84
00:14:49,682 --> 00:14:52,560
but not upon my sincerity

85
00:14:53,602 --> 00:14:58,315
The nobility makes sport of sincerity,
turning it into mere wordplay

86
00:14:58,816 --> 00:15:00,943
If that's how they define
elegance, then I —

87
00:15:01,110 --> 00:15:05,531
You'll never know
the meaning of elegance

88
00:15:06,490 --> 00:15:10,286
You can't understand
the tastes of the nobility

89
00:15:10,452 --> 00:15:11,954
Well, then

90
00:15:12,830 --> 00:15:17,167
does any nobleman love you
as truly as I do?

91
00:15:17,334 --> 00:15:20,004
Has any asked to marry you
and give you a happy home?

92
00:15:20,170 --> 00:15:21,839
Please leave

93
00:15:24,800 --> 00:15:27,845
I say this because
I want to see you happy

94
00:15:28,012 --> 00:15:29,847
I don't need your concern

95
00:15:31,390 --> 00:15:35,311
If you truly dislike me
as a person,

96
00:15:35,477 --> 00:15:37,187
I'll leave you alone

97
00:15:37,354 --> 00:15:39,148
Yes, I do!

98
00:15:39,607 --> 00:15:42,693
But if it's my low rank
you disdain,

99
00:15:42,860 --> 00:15:44,695
then I'll never give up

100
00:15:44,862 --> 00:15:46,238
Go away

101
00:15:46,405 --> 00:15:49,450
Lady Oharu, a human being —
no, a woman

102
00:15:49,617 --> 00:15:53,037
can only be happy
if she marries for love

103
00:15:53,203 --> 00:15:55,372
Rank and money
don't mean happiness

104
00:15:55,539 --> 00:15:59,543
I asked you to leave
I didn't come here to listen to you

105
00:15:59,710 --> 00:16:03,088
I'll wait alone
for Lord Kikunokoji

106
00:16:03,714 --> 00:16:05,090
I said leave

107
00:16:07,426 --> 00:16:10,095
My lord isn't coming

108
00:16:13,223 --> 00:16:14,725
Please wait!

109
00:16:17,102 --> 00:16:18,771
I'm sorry

110
00:16:19,063 --> 00:16:22,274
I simply had to see you

111
00:16:22,733 --> 00:16:24,860
Ever since
you came to the court,

112
00:16:25,027 --> 00:16:28,405
every glimpse of you
has torn at my heart

113
00:16:29,073 --> 00:16:31,617
Please at least consider
what I've said

114
00:16:34,244 --> 00:16:37,039
I did read your letter

115
00:16:37,956 --> 00:16:40,584
But no matter what you say,

116
00:16:40,751 --> 00:16:43,087
we can never be together

117
00:16:43,253 --> 00:16:44,421
Why not?

118
00:16:45,589 --> 00:16:51,095
Neither the court nor my father
would ever allow it

119
00:16:51,261 --> 00:16:53,722
Then we'll run away

120
00:16:55,391 --> 00:16:57,476
We'll make a home of our own

121
00:16:57,768 --> 00:16:59,311
I'll do my utmost

122
00:16:59,478 --> 00:17:01,689
I'd gladly do anything
to protect you

123
00:17:06,735 --> 00:17:08,278
Lady Oharu!

124
00:18:14,636 --> 00:18:16,513
Madam, we have guests

125
00:18:17,055 --> 00:18:18,474
Welcome

126
00:18:18,640 --> 00:18:20,392
The imperial magistrate
sent us

127
00:18:20,517 --> 00:18:22,686
We understand that
prostitutes use this house

128
00:18:22,811 --> 00:18:25,397
That's absurd!
Who said such a thing?

129
00:18:25,522 --> 00:18:27,357
I'll see for myself

130
00:18:59,807 --> 00:19:01,558
Who are you?

131
00:19:03,393 --> 00:19:04,978
I'm just passing through

132
00:19:05,145 --> 00:19:06,939
Aren't you a retainer?

133
00:19:07,064 --> 00:19:08,607
Yes

134
00:19:10,651 --> 00:19:13,487
I belong to the Todo clan
of Iga province

135
00:19:14,112 --> 00:19:16,907
My name is Inosuke
I serve Lord Senuemon Yasui

136
00:19:29,711 --> 00:19:32,548
You dress
like a noblewoman

137
00:19:32,714 --> 00:19:34,508
Where are you from, whore?

138
00:19:34,633 --> 00:19:37,511
How dare you!
I'm not a prostitute

139
00:19:37,636 --> 00:19:39,805
I'm the daughter
of Shinzaemon Okui,

140
00:19:40,180 --> 00:19:42,933
a samurai
serving Chion-in Temple

141
00:19:44,476 --> 00:19:46,270
Take her

142
00:19:46,436 --> 00:19:48,397
I'm taking you
to the magistrate

143
00:19:54,111 --> 00:19:55,404
Go!

144
00:19:59,700 --> 00:20:03,662
Oharu Okui, while serving
in the imperial court,

145
00:20:03,787 --> 00:20:06,164
you violated protocol

146
00:20:06,331 --> 00:20:09,960
by associating
with a personage of low birth

147
00:20:10,127 --> 00:20:14,256
As punishment for this illicit liaison,
you are sentenced as follows:

148
00:20:14,423 --> 00:20:19,136
You are hereby banished
from the city of Kyoto,

149
00:20:19,303 --> 00:20:22,806
never to return

150
00:20:22,973 --> 00:20:27,477
Your parents, for failing
to provide proper guidance,

151
00:20:27,644 --> 00:20:30,939
are hereby also
sentenced to exile

152
00:20:31,106 --> 00:20:36,820
This judgment
is effective today,

153
00:20:36,987 --> 00:20:42,034
the 7th of November, 1686

154
00:20:42,159 --> 00:20:46,163
Katsufusa Itakura,
Magistrate of Temples and Shrines

155
00:21:51,645 --> 00:21:53,230
Stop!

156
00:21:54,564 --> 00:21:57,734
Relatives may go no further
Bid them farewell here

157
00:23:26,406 --> 00:23:29,993
It's your fault we must live out here
in the middle of nowhere

158
00:23:30,994 --> 00:23:34,164
You've single-handedly destroyed
this noble family's honor

159
00:23:34,331 --> 00:23:36,041
You're a horrible child

160
00:23:37,584 --> 00:23:40,754
Why is it wrong for a man
and woman to fall in love?

161
00:23:41,338 --> 00:23:43,340
Why is it immoral?

162
00:23:43,882 --> 00:23:45,467
What?

163
00:23:47,135 --> 00:23:49,179
You slept with a man
without our consent

164
00:23:49,346 --> 00:23:52,265
If that isn't immoral, what is?
Stop talking nonsense!

165
00:23:52,432 --> 00:23:54,518
So what if we differ in rank?

166
00:23:54,684 --> 00:23:59,272
How can it be wrong
if we truly love one another?

167
00:23:59,606 --> 00:24:01,024
Silence!

168
00:24:14,037 --> 00:24:17,124
Do you have
any last words?

169
00:24:19,709 --> 00:24:21,253
Yes

170
00:24:21,878 --> 00:24:25,757
Please give Lady Oharu
the following message

171
00:24:25,924 --> 00:24:27,384
Very well

172
00:24:27,884 --> 00:24:29,553
Proceed

173
00:24:31,346 --> 00:24:34,057
"Please find a good man

174
00:24:34,224 --> 00:24:36,893
and make a happy home

175
00:24:37,394 --> 00:24:40,522
But be sure to marry

176
00:24:40,689 --> 00:24:44,067
only for true love"

177
00:24:47,904 --> 00:24:49,364
Is that all?

178
00:24:52,284 --> 00:24:53,743
Anything else?

179
00:24:57,789 --> 00:25:00,292
I hope the day will come

180
00:25:01,001 --> 00:25:04,296
when people can love freely,
regardless of rank or class

181
00:25:24,149 --> 00:25:25,692
Oharu!

182
00:26:06,650 --> 00:26:08,818
It was a messenger
from the magistrate

183
00:26:09,778 --> 00:26:13,657
He brought
Katsunosuke's will

184
00:26:17,911 --> 00:26:21,331
But you mustn't tell Father

185
00:26:36,263 --> 00:26:39,307
Oharu, stop!
What are you doing?

186
00:26:39,474 --> 00:26:41,810
Let me go!

187
00:26:55,657 --> 00:26:57,284
Stop!

188
00:27:01,746 --> 00:27:04,249
Wait, Oharu!

189
00:27:04,416 --> 00:27:06,001
Leave me alone!

190
00:27:09,713 --> 00:27:12,007
I'm going
to join Katsunosuke!

191
00:27:13,842 --> 00:27:15,176
Stop!

192
00:27:18,138 --> 00:27:19,306
You mustn't!

193
00:27:19,431 --> 00:27:22,142
Let me go!

194
00:27:23,101 --> 00:27:25,186
This isn't
the end of the world!

195
00:27:25,353 --> 00:27:27,439
If you kill yourself,
that's the end!

196
00:28:45,600 --> 00:28:47,811
- An express messenger has come
- From where?

197
00:28:47,977 --> 00:28:51,439
- Lord Matsudaira in Edo
- Matsudaira? Oh, goodness!

198
00:28:59,072 --> 00:29:00,240
What is it?

199
00:29:00,365 --> 00:29:02,492
A messenger
from Lord Matsudaira

200
00:29:02,659 --> 00:29:05,286
Show him
into the drawing room at once

201
00:29:05,453 --> 00:29:07,455
I'll change
into something else

202
00:29:29,102 --> 00:29:30,603
Are you all right?

203
00:29:44,075 --> 00:29:45,910
Oh, my!

204
00:29:49,289 --> 00:29:51,166
Give him a hand

205
00:29:55,545 --> 00:29:57,797
Now leave us alone

206
00:30:03,386 --> 00:30:05,680
Thank you for your trouble

207
00:30:05,847 --> 00:30:08,057
It must be a matter
of grave importance

208
00:30:08,892 --> 00:30:10,685
To tell you the truth,

209
00:30:11,144 --> 00:30:14,898
I seek a concubine
for Lord Matsudaira

210
00:30:15,064 --> 00:30:17,775
- A concubine?
- That's right

211
00:30:22,113 --> 00:30:25,909
You rushed here from Edo
to find a concubine?

212
00:30:26,743 --> 00:30:28,786
This is no laughing matter!

213
00:30:29,370 --> 00:30:33,249
Lady Matsudaira's illness
has left her barren

214
00:30:33,374 --> 00:30:37,795
The clan will be ruined
if the lord has no heir

215
00:30:39,589 --> 00:30:42,383
There can be
no greater calamity

216
00:30:43,468 --> 00:30:45,637
The retainers,
sick with worry,

217
00:30:45,803 --> 00:30:49,474
quickly found
some suitable young women,

218
00:30:50,225 --> 00:30:52,894
but they were all
country girls

219
00:30:53,061 --> 00:30:55,897
and not
to the lord's liking

220
00:30:59,108 --> 00:31:00,610
Give me that

221
00:31:04,864 --> 00:31:06,908
The retainers were at a loss

222
00:31:07,075 --> 00:31:11,621
and decided that since Kyoto
is famous for its women,

223
00:31:11,788 --> 00:31:15,041
there must be one here
that he would like

224
00:31:15,208 --> 00:31:18,253
They ordered me
to rush here and find her

225
00:31:18,419 --> 00:31:20,463
Is that so?

226
00:31:20,630 --> 00:31:26,177
I was worried His Lordship
was seeking a large loan

227
00:31:26,970 --> 00:31:31,432
Your mission seems
a rather simple one

228
00:31:31,599 --> 00:31:34,727
I'm afraid
it isn't so simple

229
00:31:34,894 --> 00:31:37,522
He has some
very specific requirements

230
00:31:41,150 --> 00:31:42,986
Look at that!

231
00:31:43,152 --> 00:31:44,904
To put it simply,

232
00:31:45,363 --> 00:31:49,200
he wants a girl like that

233
00:31:49,367 --> 00:31:51,369
I see

234
00:31:56,457 --> 00:31:58,126
First of all,

235
00:31:58,251 --> 00:32:01,337
"She should be
between 15 and 18

236
00:32:02,171 --> 00:32:04,424
Her face should be
fashionably round

237
00:32:04,591 --> 00:32:06,801
Her eyes
must be round too

238
00:32:07,760 --> 00:32:09,637
Thick eyebrows,

239
00:32:09,762 --> 00:32:12,140
with enough space
between the eyes

240
00:32:12,307 --> 00:32:16,853
A small mouth, with a full set
of even white teeth

241
00:32:17,020 --> 00:32:19,981
Long ears
with narrow rims

242
00:32:20,106 --> 00:32:23,443
and detached,
translucent lobes

243
00:32:23,610 --> 00:32:29,782
A natural, unaltered hairline
A long neck without wisps of hair

244
00:32:30,199 --> 00:32:34,287
Long, slender fingers
with diaphanous nails"

245
00:32:35,496 --> 00:32:38,666
That's a tall order

246
00:32:38,833 --> 00:32:41,377
- There's more
- More?

247
00:32:41,544 --> 00:32:45,340
"Feet smaller than eight inches,
with nice arches

248
00:32:45,465 --> 00:32:48,217
She must have
a long, willowy torso,

249
00:32:48,384 --> 00:32:51,721
a firm waist, but not too muscular,
a plump bottom,

250
00:32:51,888 --> 00:32:53,598
a pleasant demeanor,

251
00:32:53,723 --> 00:32:56,434
a fine figure
in whatever she wears,

252
00:32:56,601 --> 00:32:58,561
noble in birth,
meek in personality,

253
00:32:58,728 --> 00:33:01,022
and without
a single mole on her body"

254
00:33:03,066 --> 00:33:04,901
Slender fingers

255
00:33:08,529 --> 00:33:11,282
Let me see your face
Her mouth is too big

256
00:33:12,492 --> 00:33:14,952
How old are you?
- Twenty-five

257
00:33:15,119 --> 00:33:17,246
Oh, you're the leftovers

258
00:33:17,413 --> 00:33:19,415
I'm her father, sir

259
00:33:20,500 --> 00:33:22,919
No, her ears are too small

260
00:33:23,252 --> 00:33:25,755
Her face isn't round enough
- What about her?

261
00:33:26,798 --> 00:33:30,927
She just might be it!
Let me see the picture

262
00:33:31,094 --> 00:33:32,887
Let's check

263
00:33:33,054 --> 00:33:34,847
Her face is too long

264
00:33:36,641 --> 00:33:39,268
Her face is round

265
00:33:40,770 --> 00:33:43,231
Kahei, she may be the one

266
00:33:43,773 --> 00:33:46,192
No, she has a mole

267
00:33:47,360 --> 00:33:49,612
Her eyes are too slanted

268
00:33:49,779 --> 00:33:51,489
Her nose is crooked

269
00:33:51,614 --> 00:33:53,074
Her nose is flat

270
00:33:53,783 --> 00:33:55,827
She has a mole

271
00:33:57,078 --> 00:33:59,539
Her hairline is uneven
- What about this one?

272
00:33:59,706 --> 00:34:02,458
She looks promising!

273
00:34:02,583 --> 00:34:05,795
She might be the one
Turn her that way

274
00:34:05,920 --> 00:34:09,006
Your foot size?
- Ten inches

275
00:34:09,632 --> 00:34:11,384
What a pity!

276
00:34:15,972 --> 00:34:17,306
Let's see here

277
00:34:17,473 --> 00:34:19,767
No, her chin is too pointed

278
00:34:21,436 --> 00:34:23,396
No, her forehead
is too broad

279
00:34:23,563 --> 00:34:26,691
- Please look at my girl
- She looks sickly

280
00:34:27,400 --> 00:34:30,570
This one's ears are wrong

281
00:34:32,155 --> 00:34:34,490
What about her?

282
00:34:37,285 --> 00:34:39,454
Her chin isn't right

283
00:34:53,718 --> 00:34:56,220
Even in Kyoto,

284
00:34:56,387 --> 00:35:00,892
nobody could assemble
as many beauties

285
00:35:01,058 --> 00:35:03,686
as I have here today

286
00:35:03,853 --> 00:35:08,316
There's nothing more
I can do

287
00:35:11,277 --> 00:35:16,532
Won't you choose
one of them?

288
00:35:18,117 --> 00:35:20,203
Are none of them suitable?

289
00:35:32,507 --> 00:35:35,718
If the point is
to produce an heir,

290
00:35:36,010 --> 00:35:39,680
any girl should do,
as long as she's healthy

291
00:35:40,139 --> 00:35:41,891
"Thick eyebrows,

292
00:35:42,058 --> 00:35:44,685
enough space
between the eyes,

293
00:35:45,102 --> 00:35:49,065
a small mouth, with a full set
of even white teeth"

294
00:35:49,232 --> 00:35:51,567
You have it memorized

295
00:35:51,734 --> 00:35:55,863
I'll drop dead
before I find such a woman

296
00:35:56,030 --> 00:35:58,366
I sympathize

297
00:35:58,491 --> 00:36:02,995
but why send a man your age
on such a mission?

298
00:36:03,162 --> 00:36:04,914
I'll tell you why:

299
00:36:05,081 --> 00:36:07,458
A younger man
might try something

300
00:36:07,625 --> 00:36:11,337
But me? I couldn't do
anything even if I tried

301
00:36:11,462 --> 00:36:13,422
I see

302
00:36:16,384 --> 00:36:17,802
What's that?

303
00:36:17,969 --> 00:36:21,806
A blind man from Edo
teaches singing and dancing

304
00:36:21,931 --> 00:36:25,935
to the daughters
of good families

305
00:36:26,102 --> 00:36:27,603
Really?

306
00:36:27,770 --> 00:36:30,606
The girls are popular
among the samurai

307
00:36:30,773 --> 00:36:34,026
and serve at their parties

308
00:36:34,193 --> 00:36:36,112
Is that right?

309
00:36:37,738 --> 00:36:42,451
<i>The town</i>

310
00:36:45,621 --> 00:36:50,376
<i>Is laid out in a grid</i>

311
00:36:55,506 --> 00:37:01,637
<i>Just like a Go board</i>

312
00:37:25,077 --> 00:37:30,499
<i>Facing</i>

313
00:37:32,627 --> 00:37:39,175
<i>Each other</i>

314
00:37:40,968 --> 00:37:46,223
<i>Your hand</i>

315
00:37:46,599 --> 00:37:52,271
<i>Clasped in mine</i>

316
00:37:57,902 --> 00:38:05,576
<i>All is well</i>

317
00:38:09,121 --> 00:38:16,170
<i>Let us lie
in each other's arms</i>

318
00:38:21,092 --> 00:38:22,593
Her!

319
00:38:23,636 --> 00:38:25,221
Come here a minute

320
00:38:32,186 --> 00:38:34,397
Let's have
a good look at her

321
00:38:35,064 --> 00:38:37,066
Face the other way

322
00:38:37,316 --> 00:38:39,110
Turn her again

323
00:38:44,198 --> 00:38:47,451
Do you have
any moles on your body?

324
00:38:47,910 --> 00:38:50,663
- Moles?
- Do you?

325
00:38:50,913 --> 00:38:52,540
No

326
00:38:52,707 --> 00:38:55,584
- None at all?
- I don't think so

327
00:38:56,252 --> 00:38:59,797
Kahei, the search is over!
I'll buy her!

328
00:39:02,049 --> 00:39:04,343
Yes, indeed

329
00:39:16,731 --> 00:39:20,651
The messenger from Edo
is awaiting your reply

330
00:39:20,776 --> 00:39:23,821
I'll rush back
and tell him you consent

331
00:39:24,071 --> 00:39:26,282
What a relief

332
00:39:26,407 --> 00:39:28,492
If she bears him an heir,

333
00:39:28,617 --> 00:39:30,953
it will bring
even greater happiness

334
00:39:31,120 --> 00:39:33,122
to you than to her

335
00:39:33,289 --> 00:39:36,375
And to me as well,
as her new godfather

336
00:39:42,506 --> 00:39:44,216
Thank you very much

337
00:39:44,508 --> 00:39:45,968
If you please

338
00:39:46,927 --> 00:39:50,056
Thank you for everything

339
00:39:54,268 --> 00:39:57,271
We must be thankful
Things are looking up

340
00:39:57,396 --> 00:40:00,274
I never expected
anything like this to happen

341
00:40:00,399 --> 00:40:03,986
Oharu,
you've redeemed yourself

342
00:40:05,321 --> 00:40:08,824
All is forgiven

343
00:40:09,825 --> 00:40:14,497
Who would imagine mere
dancing lessons could lead to this?

344
00:40:14,663 --> 00:40:17,041
We certainly had no idea!

345
00:40:17,166 --> 00:40:19,543
<i>You'll get 100 ryo
for clothing,</i>

346
00:40:19,710 --> 00:40:22,463
and an allowance too

347
00:40:22,963 --> 00:40:25,841
What's wrong?
Aren't you happy?

348
00:40:26,008 --> 00:40:28,636
I'm to be a concubine,
am I not?

349
00:40:29,178 --> 00:40:30,721
What of it?

350
00:40:31,847 --> 00:40:34,100
<i>He's a daimyo
with a stipend of 30,000 koku.</i>

351
00:40:34,266 --> 00:40:38,395
You were at the imperial court,
so surely you understand

352
00:40:38,521 --> 00:40:42,191
If a lord favors you,
you'll be given high rank

353
00:40:42,358 --> 00:40:43,859
Indeed!

354
00:40:43,984 --> 00:40:46,862
You've been chosen
to bear the heir to the line

355
00:40:47,029 --> 00:40:49,448
You'll be a high-ranking
lady-in-waiting

356
00:40:49,615 --> 00:40:50,866
That's right

357
00:40:51,033 --> 00:40:56,747
I must ask the court
not to reveal her secret

358
00:40:56,914 --> 00:40:59,208
before Lord Matsudaira
begins his inquiries

359
00:40:59,375 --> 00:41:02,461
- And the temple too
- Yes I'll go now

360
00:41:02,628 --> 00:41:06,632
Then we'll decide what to buy
and what to take to Edo

361
00:41:06,799 --> 00:41:08,717
Come, Oharu

362
00:41:08,884 --> 00:41:11,428
- I don't want to go
- What?

363
00:41:11,595 --> 00:41:15,891
Going to a complete stranger
just to bear his child!

364
00:41:16,308 --> 00:41:19,687
It won't be just any child

365
00:41:19,812 --> 00:41:21,897
<i>He'll be heir
to a 30,000-koku domain!</i>

366
00:41:22,022 --> 00:41:24,233
Katsunosuke would
never approve

367
00:41:25,067 --> 00:41:28,654
You idiot!
Still going on about him!

368
00:41:28,821 --> 00:41:30,656
I've accepted the offer!

369
00:41:30,781 --> 00:41:32,908
You can't back out!

370
00:43:20,516 --> 00:43:22,851
She's in excellent
physical condition

371
00:43:23,018 --> 00:43:26,355
She is capable
of bearing a child

372
00:43:28,357 --> 00:43:29,775
Lady Kasai

373
00:43:29,942 --> 00:43:32,569
instruct her
in our etiquette

374
00:43:33,153 --> 00:43:35,990
and take her
to Lady Matsudaira

375
00:43:36,156 --> 00:43:37,866
Yes, my lord

376
00:44:26,582 --> 00:44:30,961
The messenger
has returned from Kyoto

377
00:44:31,128 --> 00:44:34,089
with the girl chosen
to be the concubine

378
00:44:34,465 --> 00:44:36,800
Already?

379
00:44:37,426 --> 00:44:39,553
She's waiting outside

380
00:44:39,720 --> 00:44:41,805
Will you receive her?

381
00:44:50,898 --> 00:44:55,110
Please endure this
for the sake of the clan

382
00:45:28,310 --> 00:45:30,604
Her name is Oharu Okui

383
00:45:33,399 --> 00:45:35,734
Show your face

384
00:45:39,655 --> 00:45:41,782
Won't you pay homage
to Her Ladyship?

385
00:45:45,994 --> 00:45:47,830
You may go now

386
00:46:45,637 --> 00:46:55,636
<i>Princess Morning Glory
answered the nobleman</i>

387
00:46:57,191 --> 00:47:05,240
<i>She plucked the flowers
and offered them</i>

388
00:47:06,200 --> 00:47:07,951
Come sit here

389
00:47:08,744 --> 00:47:13,916
<i>For a long time</i>

390
00:47:19,755 --> 00:47:29,754
<i>She stares pensively
at the flower in her hand</i>

391
00:47:36,939 --> 00:47:39,107
Does it remind you of Kyoto?

392
00:47:39,233 --> 00:47:42,819
You didn't expect to see Bunraku
plays here in Edo, did you?

393
00:47:43,153 --> 00:47:44,571
No, I didn't

394
00:47:45,239 --> 00:47:51,620
<i>Can this be real</i>

395
00:47:58,877 --> 00:48:04,633
<i>It is her fate</i>

396
00:48:04,800 --> 00:48:12,099
<i>To wither</i>

397
00:48:12,224 --> 00:48:17,896
<i>In the shade</i>

398
00:48:20,274 --> 00:48:28,156
<i>Day and night</i>

399
00:48:31,493 --> 00:48:37,791
<i>She stares
at the deutzia blossoms</i>

400
00:48:37,916 --> 00:48:43,839
<i>They fill her heart</i>

401
00:48:44,673 --> 00:48:47,342
Can you eat
the food here in Edo?

402
00:48:47,843 --> 00:48:51,722
If you don't like anything,
just say so

403
00:48:53,473 --> 00:48:57,060
<i>By good fortune</i>

404
00:48:57,227 --> 00:49:03,483
<i>She is given</i>

405
00:49:07,154 --> 00:49:12,659
<i>To the imperial palace</i>

406
00:49:13,076 --> 00:49:16,872
<i>What a lucky flower</i>

407
00:49:22,502 --> 00:49:28,091
<i>How enviable</i>

408
00:49:28,383 --> 00:49:34,014
<i>How fortunate you are</i>

409
00:49:34,181 --> 00:49:39,811
<i>Reluctantly</i>

410
00:49:41,813 --> 00:49:48,904
<i>She offers</i>

411
00:49:50,906 --> 00:49:57,913
<i>The flower in her hand</i>

412
00:49:58,914 --> 00:50:04,252
<i>But this flower
is only the go-between</i>

413
00:50:04,419 --> 00:50:09,341
<i>In fact,
your face is the flower</i>

414
00:50:13,595 --> 00:50:20,227
<i>That captured my heart</i>

415
00:50:43,792 --> 00:50:45,961
She has given birth
to an heir

416
00:50:46,128 --> 00:50:49,214
Inform the head maid

417
00:51:04,855 --> 00:51:07,399
Auspicious news:
An heir has been born!

418
00:51:07,566 --> 00:51:10,485
A boy!
Auspicious indeed!

419
00:51:10,652 --> 00:51:13,029
We must inform
His Lordship at once

420
00:51:23,999 --> 00:51:27,419
A lovely baby
He looks just like you

421
00:51:30,505 --> 00:51:32,382
Is that so?

422
00:51:35,510 --> 00:51:39,806
Is His Lordship pleased?

423
00:51:39,973 --> 00:51:43,393
He's delighted

424
00:51:46,313 --> 00:51:49,733
I was so unhappy

425
00:51:49,858 --> 00:51:52,194
when I was
first brought here

426
00:51:53,195 --> 00:51:55,363
But now
that I've given birth —

427
00:51:55,530 --> 00:52:00,160
No, you must say you were
"allowed to give birth"

428
00:52:00,327 --> 00:52:02,871
Now that I've been
allowed to give birth,

429
00:52:03,038 --> 00:52:06,041
I feel for the first time
that this is my home

430
00:52:06,208 --> 00:52:08,835
His Lordship must be —

431
00:52:09,085 --> 00:52:11,797
Oh, pardon me

432
00:52:21,973 --> 00:52:25,936
Nothing could be
more auspicious for the clan

433
00:52:26,603 --> 00:52:28,438
You have done well

434
00:52:32,692 --> 00:52:35,403
Where are you taking my —
I mean, the infant heir?

435
00:52:35,570 --> 00:52:37,239
I'm going to nurse him

436
00:52:37,405 --> 00:52:39,074
Nurse him?

437
00:52:39,241 --> 00:52:43,411
But I can nurse him myself

438
00:53:02,556 --> 00:53:04,182
Thank you

439
00:53:05,016 --> 00:53:07,561
I'll make a tidy profit
with this satin

440
00:53:11,773 --> 00:53:15,777
You're worried
about payment, aren't you?

441
00:53:15,944 --> 00:53:17,279
Relax

442
00:53:17,404 --> 00:53:20,282
<i>I have Lord Matsudaira's
30,000 koku backing me up</i>

443
00:53:20,448 --> 00:53:23,410
My master's very strict
about these things

444
00:53:23,535 --> 00:53:25,370
You mean Kahei?

445
00:53:26,246 --> 00:53:29,291
Listen, my daughter
just gave birth

446
00:53:29,416 --> 00:53:31,501
to the heir to the clan

447
00:53:31,626 --> 00:53:35,338
<i>You look surprised
He'll inherit those 30,000 koku.</i>

448
00:53:35,463 --> 00:53:37,173
Heir to the clan?

449
00:53:37,549 --> 00:53:39,968
Word arrived
the day before yesterday

450
00:53:46,766 --> 00:53:49,185
Money is no object

451
00:53:49,311 --> 00:53:52,647
Bring me the finest you have,
and lots of it

452
00:53:53,398 --> 00:53:55,066
Congratulations

453
00:53:55,400 --> 00:53:56,860
Look

454
00:53:58,153 --> 00:54:01,114
It seems
your worries are over

455
00:54:01,281 --> 00:54:03,742
<i>Shall I bring out
the habutae silk?</i>

456
00:54:03,909 --> 00:54:06,828
- Don't be hasty
- Bring out everything

457
00:54:06,953 --> 00:54:09,706
I'm opening a shop
on Muromachi Avenue

458
00:54:09,873 --> 00:54:13,460
I want it to rival Sasaya's store,
so show me everything

459
00:54:18,757 --> 00:54:21,843
What's happened
to the concubine?

460
00:54:22,677 --> 00:54:26,848
His Lordship's love for her
has grown since she gave birth

461
00:54:27,015 --> 00:54:28,350
What's wrong with that?

462
00:54:28,516 --> 00:54:30,101
It's just that

463
00:54:30,268 --> 00:54:33,521
he seems to grow weaker
by the day

464
00:54:33,688 --> 00:54:35,273
The doctor says

465
00:54:35,398 --> 00:54:37,525
if she continues
to share his bed,

466
00:54:37,692 --> 00:54:40,654
it may shorten his life

467
00:54:40,779 --> 00:54:42,572
We can't let that happen

468
00:54:42,697 --> 00:54:45,367
The heir has been born
She's of no further use

469
00:54:45,492 --> 00:54:47,869
Isn't that right, Isobe?

470
00:54:48,620 --> 00:54:51,373
For the sake of the clan,
send her home

471
00:54:54,542 --> 00:54:56,670
- But —
- Do it

472
00:55:35,208 --> 00:55:37,460
She was dismissed?

473
00:55:37,752 --> 00:55:39,754
Are you sure?

474
00:55:42,674 --> 00:55:44,676
I don't know what to say

475
00:55:45,760 --> 00:55:48,054
When she gave birth,

476
00:55:48,221 --> 00:55:51,599
I was filled
with happiness and pride

477
00:55:53,018 --> 00:55:54,811
I'm very sorry

478
00:56:41,691 --> 00:56:43,777
So now you're back

479
00:56:45,653 --> 00:56:48,698
After you bore the lord an heir,

480
00:56:49,157 --> 00:56:54,829
you should have
withheld your affections a bit

481
00:57:04,672 --> 00:57:07,884
Anyway, too late now

482
00:57:08,510 --> 00:57:11,054
How much
did they give you?

483
00:57:12,764 --> 00:57:15,642
<i>Three hundred ryo
would be a great help</i>

484
00:57:22,440 --> 00:57:24,400
<i>Just five ryo?</i>

485
00:57:38,456 --> 00:57:41,167
I thought you'd be rich

486
00:57:41,709 --> 00:57:44,796
I bought
a huge amount of fabric

487
00:57:45,547 --> 00:57:48,758
Now I'm deep in debt

488
00:57:51,678 --> 00:57:54,722
For our sake,

489
00:57:54,848 --> 00:57:57,183
work in Shimabara
as a courtesan

490
00:57:57,392 --> 00:58:02,230
I'll buy your freedom
when I sell the fabric

491
00:58:03,565 --> 00:58:07,068
You mean you'd actually
sell your own daughter?

492
00:58:07,235 --> 00:58:09,904
There's no other choice

493
00:58:10,071 --> 00:58:15,034
After everything
she's been through —

494
00:58:15,201 --> 00:58:17,328
and now this!

495
00:59:17,764 --> 00:59:19,265
Welcome

496
00:59:21,267 --> 00:59:23,186
I've always wanted

497
00:59:23,311 --> 00:59:26,564
to live it up in Shimabara
at least once before I die

498
00:59:26,689 --> 00:59:29,275
I've risen
every day at dawn

499
00:59:29,442 --> 00:59:33,780
and worked hard until the stars
came out in the sky

500
00:59:33,947 --> 00:59:36,115
It must be 20 years

501
00:59:36,241 --> 00:59:39,786
that I've been saving
my money

502
00:59:39,953 --> 00:59:42,830
I think I've finally
saved enough,

503
00:59:42,956 --> 00:59:46,668
so I've come
all the way from Echigo

504
00:59:47,669 --> 00:59:49,212
Unfortunately

505
00:59:49,337 --> 00:59:52,840
we're full at the moment
- Are you turning me away?

506
00:59:54,759 --> 00:59:57,470
You're all
as pretty as a picture!

507
00:59:57,762 --> 00:59:59,430
Pardon me, sir,

508
00:59:59,597 --> 01:00:03,393
but this is a particularly
expensive establishment

509
01:00:03,559 --> 01:00:06,271
Do you have
a letter of introduction?

510
01:00:06,437 --> 01:00:07,981
All righty

511
01:00:08,106 --> 01:00:12,026
If it's money you want
here's what I got

512
01:00:12,193 --> 01:00:15,154
Enough to fill a five-quart container
Is that enough?

513
01:00:15,280 --> 01:00:17,573
More than enough!

514
01:00:18,866 --> 01:00:21,703
Welcome, sir
I'm the owner here

515
01:00:21,869 --> 01:00:24,539
Is that so?
So you'll let me stay?

516
01:00:25,540 --> 01:00:28,626
Prepare our largest room

517
01:00:28,793 --> 01:00:31,546
and lay out our finest food

518
01:00:31,713 --> 01:00:34,090
Call for Shizuhata

519
01:00:34,257 --> 01:00:36,050
Hurry!

520
01:00:36,301 --> 01:00:40,555
Thank you for honoring us
with your presence

521
01:00:40,722 --> 01:00:43,057
See that my men
have a good time too

522
01:00:43,224 --> 01:00:45,018
They've come a long way

523
01:00:45,143 --> 01:00:47,186
Your packhorse drivers?
As you wish, sir

524
01:00:47,353 --> 01:00:49,480
Hey, welcome them inside!

525
01:00:49,647 --> 01:00:51,733
I have some sake
on my horse

526
01:00:51,899 --> 01:00:54,652
Sir, we serve
the very best sake

527
01:00:54,819 --> 01:00:57,613
Thank you

528
01:01:44,994 --> 01:01:46,245
Shizuhata

529
01:01:46,371 --> 01:01:51,125
our finest courtesan

530
01:01:51,292 --> 01:01:55,338
All right,
let's liven things up a bit!

531
01:02:19,028 --> 01:02:21,489
Hey, why aren't you
picking them up?

532
01:02:21,656 --> 01:02:23,032
Here

533
01:02:23,408 --> 01:02:26,494
Hey!
Where are your manners?

534
01:02:26,828 --> 01:02:29,497
It's he who has
no manners

535
01:02:29,664 --> 01:02:32,208
I'm not a beggar

536
01:02:32,750 --> 01:02:34,210
Wait!

537
01:02:34,377 --> 01:02:37,338
Stop!
Come back here!

538
01:02:48,516 --> 01:02:50,017
Just a minute

539
01:02:50,184 --> 01:02:52,228
What do you think
your job is?

540
01:02:52,353 --> 01:02:54,272
Think you're too good
to be here?

541
01:02:54,397 --> 01:02:58,359
You're not here
for your own enjoyment

542
01:02:59,110 --> 01:03:02,363
Constantly carrying on
about your pedigree!

543
01:03:03,448 --> 01:03:06,325
For all I know, you could be
a ragpicker's daughter

544
01:03:06,492 --> 01:03:10,079
How dare you suggest
such a thing!

545
01:03:10,246 --> 01:03:12,415
You're bought and paid for

546
01:03:12,582 --> 01:03:16,419
You're no different
from a fish on a chopping board

547
01:03:16,711 --> 01:03:19,672
We can serve you up
any way we like

548
01:03:19,839 --> 01:03:22,383
He offered you money
What's wrong with that?

549
01:03:27,889 --> 01:03:29,307
Fine, then

550
01:03:29,557 --> 01:03:33,603
Never come back here again

551
01:03:33,811 --> 01:03:36,522
What will your master
say to that?

552
01:03:36,772 --> 01:03:38,858
If I dismiss you,

553
01:03:39,025 --> 01:03:42,904
no one in these parts
will hire you as a courtesan

554
01:03:44,280 --> 01:03:46,073
Now get out

555
01:03:52,455 --> 01:03:54,790
It was all my fault

556
01:03:55,917 --> 01:03:59,879
I'm sorry
Please forgive me

557
01:04:00,463 --> 01:04:04,091
I'll try to do better
from now on

558
01:04:04,258 --> 01:04:06,135
But please
don't tell my master

559
01:04:06,302 --> 01:04:08,638
It's too late now
Get out

560
01:04:08,804 --> 01:04:12,141
Master, the big spender
is calling for her

561
01:04:12,308 --> 01:04:14,769
I'll give him
someone better

562
01:04:14,936 --> 01:04:18,689
No, he says
he likes this one

563
01:04:18,856 --> 01:04:21,651
He's never known a girl
who refused money

564
01:04:21,817 --> 01:04:24,737
He wants to buy her
and take her home

565
01:04:24,862 --> 01:04:26,447
Buy her?

566
01:04:30,451 --> 01:04:32,954
You heard her

567
01:04:33,120 --> 01:04:35,748
He wants to buy you
and take you to Echigo

568
01:04:35,915 --> 01:04:38,793
Please put on a happy face
and serve him

569
01:04:38,960 --> 01:04:41,087
Let's go

570
01:04:45,049 --> 01:04:46,968
He's buying your freedom

571
01:05:05,653 --> 01:05:07,822
Be nice to him, please

572
01:05:14,954 --> 01:05:17,832
Will you really
buy my freedom

573
01:05:17,957 --> 01:05:19,875
and take me to Echigo?

574
01:05:20,001 --> 01:05:21,961
Yes, I'll take care of you

575
01:05:22,128 --> 01:05:25,673
Actually, I came
to Kyoto to find a wife

576
01:05:25,840 --> 01:05:28,301
I won't go back without one

577
01:05:28,426 --> 01:05:30,428
Will you join me?

578
01:05:32,513 --> 01:05:35,308
If your feelings are genuine,

579
01:05:36,058 --> 01:05:39,228
I'll serve you faithfully

580
01:05:45,568 --> 01:05:47,653
Why are you laughing?

581
01:05:48,613 --> 01:05:50,323
Money

582
01:05:51,741 --> 01:05:53,492
Money!

583
01:05:54,869 --> 01:05:58,080
As long as I have money,

584
01:05:58,205 --> 01:06:00,541
I can have
anything in the world

585
01:06:03,544 --> 01:06:05,880
People see money
and their eyes gleam

586
01:06:06,047 --> 01:06:08,007
They crawl on all fours

587
01:06:08,132 --> 01:06:12,386
Even a haughty woman like you
smiles and sidles up to me

588
01:06:13,429 --> 01:06:17,558
You think I'm greedy,
but I'm not

589
01:06:18,643 --> 01:06:22,229
I want to be
with you because —

590
01:06:22,396 --> 01:06:25,941
Because everyone has a price,
and this is yours

591
01:06:26,567 --> 01:06:28,653
Thanks to this money,

592
01:06:28,778 --> 01:06:30,988
your fortune has turned

593
01:06:31,238 --> 01:06:33,407
Lord Money!

594
01:06:33,532 --> 01:06:36,118
Almighty Money!

595
01:06:45,586 --> 01:06:47,588
You fraud!

596
01:06:48,047 --> 01:06:50,216
No wonder
you spend so freely!

597
01:06:50,383 --> 01:06:52,426
He's a counterfeiter!

598
01:06:52,551 --> 01:06:54,428
Your money is bogus!

599
01:06:54,553 --> 01:06:56,597
You'll be beheaded!

600
01:06:56,764 --> 01:06:58,432
Come quietly!

601
01:07:13,489 --> 01:07:14,949
Don't resist!

602
01:07:17,118 --> 01:07:18,285
Fool!

603
01:07:18,869 --> 01:07:20,538
You're under arrest!

604
01:07:54,530 --> 01:07:56,198
Please

605
01:07:56,657 --> 01:07:58,659
try to smile

606
01:07:58,826 --> 01:08:01,328
I'm begging you

607
01:08:02,079 --> 01:08:05,624
You're our daughter again

608
01:08:07,001 --> 01:08:10,254
You don't know
how I've waited

609
01:08:10,379 --> 01:08:15,050
for the day you'd return to us
from Shimabara

610
01:08:19,930 --> 01:08:24,101
We won't cause you
any more suffering

611
01:08:25,060 --> 01:08:29,356
Please forgive us and smile

612
01:08:29,523 --> 01:08:31,525
Welcome

613
01:08:34,570 --> 01:08:40,826
<i>My sad fate</i>

614
01:08:58,052 --> 01:09:06,936
<i>Is pitiful indeed</i>

615
01:09:12,650 --> 01:09:16,070
Where did you learn
that song?

616
01:09:16,195 --> 01:09:18,030
It's so beautiful

617
01:09:18,155 --> 01:09:20,741
You must be
an accomplished singer

618
01:09:21,075 --> 01:09:23,410
I'm so ashamed

619
01:09:23,536 --> 01:09:28,457
Back when there were
pleasure quarters in Rokujo,

620
01:09:28,624 --> 01:09:32,419
I was a courtesan
named Katsuragi

621
01:09:39,593 --> 01:09:41,720
Take care of yourself

622
01:09:42,263 --> 01:09:44,056
Thank you

623
01:09:54,191 --> 01:09:55,943
Here you are

624
01:10:00,281 --> 01:10:04,326
<i>My pillow is soaked</i>

625
01:10:09,790 --> 01:10:12,126
<i>With tears</i>

626
01:10:20,968 --> 01:10:23,304
I'm glad you came

627
01:10:23,470 --> 01:10:26,432
You were once
Lord Matsudaira's concubine

628
01:10:26,599 --> 01:10:29,643
I'm hesitant
to ask for your help

629
01:10:29,810 --> 01:10:32,563
Please don't feel that way

630
01:10:32,730 --> 01:10:36,191
Try to think of me
as your sister

631
01:10:36,317 --> 01:10:39,403
We'll treat you well
while you're here

632
01:10:39,528 --> 01:10:41,864
and find you
a good husband

633
01:10:42,031 --> 01:10:43,657
I'm very grateful

634
01:10:43,824 --> 01:10:47,161
My wife has few relatives,

635
01:10:47,328 --> 01:10:49,580
so please be
a good friend to her

636
01:10:49,705 --> 01:10:51,749
May I have
a word with her?

637
01:11:17,441 --> 01:11:22,196
I must ask you
something right away

638
01:11:22,363 --> 01:11:23,906
Will you hear me out?

639
01:11:24,156 --> 01:11:25,658
What is it?

640
01:11:35,751 --> 01:11:39,546
Please write a solemn oath

641
01:11:39,713 --> 01:11:44,468
never to reveal
my secret to anyone

642
01:11:44,969 --> 01:11:47,096
Why would I ever
reveal your secret?

643
01:11:47,262 --> 01:11:49,223
Please, just do it

644
01:12:09,451 --> 01:12:11,620
Thank you very much

645
01:12:13,414 --> 01:12:15,457
Now, how may I serve you?

646
01:12:16,417 --> 01:12:21,005
There's only one thing
I'll ever ask you to do:

647
01:12:21,296 --> 01:12:25,592
Will you please
dress and style my hair?

648
01:12:25,718 --> 01:12:28,595
I expected you
to ask much more

649
01:12:28,762 --> 01:12:31,265
Then you'll do it?
I'm so glad

650
01:12:32,141 --> 01:12:34,435
The woman I had doing it

651
01:12:34,601 --> 01:12:37,938
suddenly
became indisposed

652
01:12:38,522 --> 01:12:41,066
I'm not very good at it,

653
01:12:41,233 --> 01:12:43,736
but I can try

654
01:12:44,236 --> 01:12:47,781
The thing is,
my hair's so

655
01:12:48,615 --> 01:12:50,826
Your hair is beautiful

656
01:12:50,993 --> 01:12:52,911
No, it's not

657
01:12:58,542 --> 01:13:00,210
Come with me

658
01:13:50,677 --> 01:13:54,306
I was seriously ill last year

659
01:13:55,224 --> 01:13:58,811
This is what
it did to my hair

660
01:14:01,605 --> 01:14:04,316
I made this wig

661
01:14:04,441 --> 01:14:07,361
while recuperating
at my parents' home

662
01:14:08,195 --> 01:14:13,200
I've tried
to keep it a secret

663
01:14:14,576 --> 01:14:18,205
I'm terrified that
my husband will find out

664
01:14:18,372 --> 01:14:20,791
He'd be revolted

665
01:14:20,999 --> 01:14:25,129
Please don't tell him

666
01:14:26,505 --> 01:14:29,716
I promise I won't

667
01:15:04,585 --> 01:15:07,087
Having your hair dressed?

668
01:15:07,254 --> 01:15:10,716
Very nicely done

669
01:15:10,841 --> 01:15:12,718
Oharu's quite good

670
01:15:12,885 --> 01:15:14,761
She did it for you?

671
01:15:15,971 --> 01:15:17,598
Dear

672
01:15:17,764 --> 01:15:20,726
what would you say
to adopting Oharu

673
01:15:20,851 --> 01:15:23,478
and finding her
a nice husband?

674
01:15:23,645 --> 01:15:24,771
Certainly

675
01:15:24,938 --> 01:15:26,982
Perhaps a man
from your store?

676
01:15:27,149 --> 01:15:30,319
No, there's nobody
good enough here

677
01:15:37,784 --> 01:15:39,328
Pardon me

678
01:15:40,579 --> 01:15:41,914
What is it?

679
01:15:42,080 --> 01:15:45,375
Shall I send the bill
to the customer?

680
01:15:45,542 --> 01:15:47,419
Ask Jihei He knows

681
01:15:48,003 --> 01:15:49,838
What are you looking at?

682
01:15:50,839 --> 01:15:52,633
I'll do that

683
01:16:05,229 --> 01:16:06,897
Now what?

684
01:16:07,064 --> 01:16:09,566
What about the turmeric
salesman's bill?

685
01:16:09,733 --> 01:16:12,486
Don't ask me
Ask Jihei

686
01:16:12,611 --> 01:16:14,655
You're getting on my nerves

687
01:16:14,780 --> 01:16:16,573
Fine I'll go
to the shop myself

688
01:16:17,908 --> 01:16:19,910
What are you staring at?

689
01:16:25,040 --> 01:16:27,960
Bunkichi,
stop staring and hurry up!

690
01:16:29,670 --> 01:16:32,381
- Welcome
- Good day

691
01:16:32,673 --> 01:16:34,174
Oh, you're here

692
01:16:34,341 --> 01:16:36,510
What a rare treat
Please come in

693
01:16:36,635 --> 01:16:38,762
- Sorry I haven't been in touch
- Not at all

694
01:16:38,887 --> 01:16:41,848
Bring some tea
- Please don't bother

695
01:16:41,974 --> 01:16:45,894
Looks like business is booming
- I wouldn't go that far

696
01:16:48,313 --> 01:16:51,608
Oharu, please make
some tea for our guest

697
01:17:04,705 --> 01:17:07,165
Shall I take it in for you?

698
01:17:07,332 --> 01:17:08,875
No, thank you

699
01:17:11,128 --> 01:17:14,339
May I observe you?

700
01:17:15,215 --> 01:17:17,050
You're making me nervous

701
01:17:24,558 --> 01:17:26,310
You do it so well

702
01:17:26,893 --> 01:17:29,438
Stop that
Get away from me

703
01:17:47,039 --> 01:17:49,791
I just can't make
any money these days

704
01:17:49,958 --> 01:17:52,377
- I hear you do
- Nonsense

705
01:17:52,544 --> 01:17:54,921
People like to talk

706
01:17:57,174 --> 01:17:58,842
Thank you

707
01:18:01,762 --> 01:18:03,680
It's you!

708
01:18:05,891 --> 01:18:08,769
I didn't know you were here

709
01:18:08,935 --> 01:18:12,272
Won't you wait a moment?

710
01:18:12,606 --> 01:18:14,232
Wait!

711
01:18:14,399 --> 01:18:16,026
You know her?

712
01:18:17,110 --> 01:18:18,779
What's she doing here?

713
01:18:18,945 --> 01:18:21,281
I'm taking care of her

714
01:18:21,448 --> 01:18:24,701
You make it sound so noble

715
01:18:24,910 --> 01:18:26,953
What on earth do you mean?

716
01:18:27,120 --> 01:18:29,664
Don't play innocent
You bought her, right?

717
01:18:29,831 --> 01:18:30,999
Bought her?

718
01:18:31,166 --> 01:18:33,377
She's a Shimabara courtesan

719
01:18:33,543 --> 01:18:35,003
Shimabara?

720
01:18:35,462 --> 01:18:38,715
Shimabara,
as in the pleasure quarter?

721
01:18:38,965 --> 01:18:41,093
Where else?

722
01:18:53,939 --> 01:18:59,194
So when Hishiya told you,
that was the first you'd heard of it?

723
01:18:59,361 --> 01:19:00,821
Yes

724
01:19:01,822 --> 01:19:03,990
You knew before,
didn't you?

725
01:19:04,991 --> 01:19:07,285
That's why you took her in

726
01:19:08,245 --> 01:19:10,622
Don't be absurd

727
01:19:17,504 --> 01:19:19,840
You sent her
to Lord Matsudaira

728
01:19:20,006 --> 01:19:21,633
You must have known

729
01:19:21,800 --> 01:19:23,677
I didn't know
I was shocked

730
01:19:23,844 --> 01:19:26,179
You saw her at Shimabara,
didn't you?

731
01:19:26,430 --> 01:19:28,348
What are you talking about?

732
01:19:28,515 --> 01:19:30,892
I've never even been
to Shimabara

733
01:19:31,059 --> 01:19:34,855
You think I'd waste
good money in a place like that?

734
01:19:35,021 --> 01:19:39,192
I'm so tight I step carefully
so I don't damage my sandals!

735
01:19:39,484 --> 01:19:40,569
You're lying!

736
01:19:40,735 --> 01:19:42,362
Stop this!

737
01:19:42,529 --> 01:19:43,822
<i>Excuse me.</i>

738
01:19:43,989 --> 01:19:45,449
What is it?

739
01:19:46,032 --> 01:19:49,035
- A letter from the money exchange
- I see

740
01:20:00,714 --> 01:20:02,466
Be careful!

741
01:20:04,176 --> 01:20:06,178
Watch what you're doing!

742
01:20:27,157 --> 01:20:28,700
Cut your hair

743
01:20:29,367 --> 01:20:31,244
Your hair — cut it!

744
01:20:31,411 --> 01:20:33,038
Why?

745
01:20:33,538 --> 01:20:36,374
You plan to use
your beautiful hair

746
01:20:37,751 --> 01:20:40,295
to steal my husband away!

747
01:20:40,462 --> 01:20:42,130
I heard all about it

748
01:20:42,255 --> 01:20:44,716
I know all about your past

749
01:20:44,883 --> 01:20:47,511
You lied to me

750
01:20:47,677 --> 01:20:49,930
I apologize
But I swear I never —

751
01:20:50,096 --> 01:20:52,140
Cut it Cut it!

752
01:20:52,307 --> 01:20:55,101
Cut it! Go on!

753
01:21:26,091 --> 01:21:28,635
That's not enough
Cut off more!

754
01:21:28,802 --> 01:21:30,929
Please don't, madam!

755
01:21:31,096 --> 01:21:32,973
Cut it!

756
01:21:33,139 --> 01:21:36,309
If you don't cut it, I will!

757
01:21:38,812 --> 01:21:42,774
I'll cut it off
Just watch me

758
01:22:05,171 --> 01:22:06,298
Good morning

759
01:22:06,464 --> 01:22:09,259
Oharu,
where did my wife go?

760
01:22:09,384 --> 01:22:11,469
To the cemetery

761
01:22:11,636 --> 01:22:13,138
I see

762
01:22:13,888 --> 01:22:15,682
Oharu

763
01:22:16,641 --> 01:22:20,770
you're a naughty girl
I heard all about your past

764
01:22:21,229 --> 01:22:22,856
I'm sorry

765
01:23:11,988 --> 01:23:15,158
I'm not scolding you

766
01:23:18,244 --> 01:23:23,541
I'll bet you had
some fun times, eh?

767
01:23:26,002 --> 01:23:29,506
One would never guess
just looking at your face

768
01:23:29,673 --> 01:23:34,594
But you really liked doing
those dirty things, didn't you?

769
01:23:34,844 --> 01:23:37,222
That's how you twisted
Lord Matsudaira

770
01:23:37,347 --> 01:23:39,265
around your little finger

771
01:23:39,432 --> 01:23:41,643
I did no such thing

772
01:23:42,435 --> 01:23:44,479
It's all right

773
01:23:45,063 --> 01:23:47,107
I understand completely

774
01:23:47,273 --> 01:23:50,652
You can relax
and be yourself around me

775
01:23:55,407 --> 01:23:57,450
I can enjoy
a top courtesan

776
01:23:59,452 --> 01:24:02,789
and not even
have to pay for it

777
01:24:03,331 --> 01:24:04,916
Calm down!

778
01:24:22,642 --> 01:24:26,855
Remember this smell

779
01:24:32,986 --> 01:24:34,571
All right?

780
01:25:27,290 --> 01:25:29,918
What's wrong?

781
01:25:33,838 --> 01:25:36,216
My hair!

782
01:25:38,134 --> 01:25:39,719
Where are you going?

783
01:25:41,638 --> 01:25:42,889
Oharu!

784
01:25:43,056 --> 01:25:46,684
It was you!
You did this to my hair!

785
01:25:50,730 --> 01:25:52,774
It's nothing

786
01:25:52,899 --> 01:25:54,818
Go back to bed

787
01:25:54,943 --> 01:25:57,195
She's just mumbling
in her sleep

788
01:26:02,742 --> 01:26:04,536
Here you are

789
01:26:13,253 --> 01:26:16,047
- More?
- No, thank you

790
01:26:38,486 --> 01:26:40,780
Don't worry

791
01:26:41,656 --> 01:26:44,284
It's too soon to despair

792
01:26:44,450 --> 01:26:47,412
If one god forsakes you,
another will save you

793
01:26:47,996 --> 01:26:51,708
Yakichi here works in the fan shop
He's singled you out

794
01:26:53,543 --> 01:26:58,673
His boss is going
to help him

795
01:26:58,840 --> 01:27:01,175
set up his own shop

796
01:27:02,135 --> 01:27:06,639
He's asking
for your hand in marriage

797
01:27:07,140 --> 01:27:10,643
I think
I'll excuse myself now

798
01:27:10,810 --> 01:27:13,187
What about your proposal?

799
01:27:13,354 --> 01:27:15,648
Perhaps you could
discuss that with Oharu

800
01:27:22,113 --> 01:27:24,240
Look how naive he is

801
01:27:25,950 --> 01:27:28,745
I hear he's devoted
to his work

802
01:27:28,912 --> 01:27:31,789
He's never once been
to the pleasure quarters

803
01:27:32,332 --> 01:27:34,792
You couldn't hope

804
01:27:34,918 --> 01:27:37,545
for a happier life
than as his wife

805
01:27:37,670 --> 01:27:40,840
I'm hardly worthy
of such a man

806
01:27:41,215 --> 01:27:44,135
After all, my past

807
01:27:44,844 --> 01:27:46,763
He knows all about you

808
01:27:46,930 --> 01:27:51,267
We told him everything
Didn't hide a single detail

809
01:27:51,434 --> 01:27:53,436
He said,

810
01:27:53,561 --> 01:27:55,855
"I don't mind

811
01:27:56,022 --> 01:28:00,360
I want to make that poor,
unlucky girl happy"

812
01:28:00,526 --> 01:28:03,029
He's in love with you

813
01:28:30,890 --> 01:28:34,185
- Going out so early?
- Yes I won't be long

814
01:28:34,352 --> 01:28:37,689
You were up late last night
working on the books

815
01:28:37,855 --> 01:28:40,733
Yes, it was nearly dawn
when I finished

816
01:28:41,234 --> 01:28:42,860
I'm quite sleepy

817
01:28:43,027 --> 01:28:45,738
Why don't you rest
for a while?

818
01:28:46,239 --> 01:28:48,574
I have to deliver these today

819
01:28:48,741 --> 01:28:50,368
Really?

820
01:28:50,535 --> 01:28:52,954
I'll buy a sash for you
on the way home

821
01:28:53,121 --> 01:28:55,373
How nice!
Thank you!

822
01:28:56,541 --> 01:28:58,084
Wait a minute

823
01:29:01,879 --> 01:29:03,631
Face this way

824
01:29:08,636 --> 01:29:11,139
Perfect

825
01:29:11,514 --> 01:29:13,349
Hurry back

826
01:29:18,396 --> 01:29:20,023
<i>Excuse me.</i>

827
01:29:20,189 --> 01:29:21,649
Welcome

828
01:29:21,816 --> 01:29:24,819
I'd like a dancing fan
for my daughter

829
01:29:24,986 --> 01:29:27,613
Certainly

830
01:29:28,823 --> 01:29:30,908
It's very hot today

831
01:29:37,331 --> 01:29:40,084
These are some of our best

832
01:29:40,251 --> 01:29:42,045
I see

833
01:29:45,131 --> 01:29:47,925
You have a lovely shop

834
01:29:48,384 --> 01:29:49,844
Thank you

835
01:29:50,303 --> 01:29:54,390
You should marry soon
and run a shop like this

836
01:29:55,892 --> 01:29:59,437
Running an honest business
is a good life, isn't it?

837
01:30:01,731 --> 01:30:04,150
Your husband
has accomplished much

838
01:30:04,317 --> 01:30:06,277
at such a young age

839
01:30:06,444 --> 01:30:09,113
He's just an honest,
hardworking man

840
01:30:09,238 --> 01:30:11,074
I envy you

841
01:30:11,949 --> 01:30:14,494
You're so pretty

842
01:30:14,619 --> 01:30:17,330
You two make
an ideal couple

843
01:30:19,373 --> 01:30:21,167
Any children?

844
01:30:21,751 --> 01:30:23,336
Not yet

845
01:30:23,503 --> 01:30:25,171
Is that so?

846
01:30:47,485 --> 01:30:50,363
- Madam!
- What is it?

847
01:30:50,530 --> 01:30:51,989
Awful news!

848
01:30:52,115 --> 01:30:53,699
It's your husband!

849
01:30:53,825 --> 01:30:55,618
What's happened?

850
01:31:22,562 --> 01:31:25,773
He was probably killed
by a robber

851
01:31:26,566 --> 01:31:29,277
He died clutching this sash

852
01:31:37,243 --> 01:31:38,870
Yakichi!

853
01:32:45,811 --> 01:32:49,232
A handsome youth at morn

854
01:32:49,357 --> 01:32:52,276
is by dusk a heap of bones

855
01:32:52,902 --> 01:32:57,990
All is truly impermanent
in this world

856
01:32:59,867 --> 01:33:05,289
What do you plan
to do now?

857
01:33:05,623 --> 01:33:09,543
My late husband's uncle

858
01:33:09,669 --> 01:33:12,380
sold the shop

859
01:33:13,172 --> 01:33:15,508
Where does that leave you?

860
01:33:15,675 --> 01:33:18,010
I'm going back
to my parents

861
01:33:19,887 --> 01:33:23,891
Did he leave you anything
to remember him by?

862
01:33:24,058 --> 01:33:26,352
No, nothing

863
01:33:26,477 --> 01:33:27,687
Nothing?

864
01:33:27,853 --> 01:33:30,898
I don't need anything

865
01:33:31,065 --> 01:33:35,736
I want to become a nun
and serve Buddha

866
01:33:36,404 --> 01:33:37,905
A nun?

867
01:33:38,072 --> 01:33:40,533
Please show me the way!

868
01:33:54,755 --> 01:33:56,632
Bunkichi?

869
01:33:58,342 --> 01:33:59,802
Hey, where's Bunkichi?

870
01:33:59,969 --> 01:34:01,637
<i>Here I am.</i>

871
01:34:07,893 --> 01:34:09,979
Look at this

872
01:34:11,564 --> 01:34:14,567
Who's this charge account for?

873
01:34:16,986 --> 01:34:19,739
An acquaintance of mine

874
01:34:19,905 --> 01:34:24,035
I've told you repeatedly:
We don't extend credit

875
01:34:24,201 --> 01:34:27,580
This is unacceptable
Go collect the money tomorrow

876
01:34:28,622 --> 01:34:32,084
Can't it wait a month?

877
01:34:32,251 --> 01:34:35,504
No
If it's too awkward for you,

878
01:34:35,629 --> 01:34:37,214
I'll go myself

879
01:34:37,381 --> 01:34:39,091
Where is he?

880
01:34:40,760 --> 01:34:42,595
You refuse to tell me?

881
01:34:44,555 --> 01:34:46,182
You won't tell me?

882
01:35:16,045 --> 01:35:17,505
Excuse me

883
01:35:17,671 --> 01:35:19,465
Jihei!

884
01:35:19,632 --> 01:35:22,468
It's been such a long time

885
01:35:22,635 --> 01:35:24,261
You're incorrigible,

886
01:35:24,387 --> 01:35:27,473
luring poor Bunkichi
to a place like this

887
01:35:27,640 --> 01:35:29,850
What do you mean?

888
01:35:30,017 --> 01:35:33,145
He heard I was here

889
01:35:33,312 --> 01:35:36,107
and kindly brought me
some fabric

890
01:35:36,273 --> 01:35:40,986
Fine I'm here to collect
for what he gave you on credit

891
01:35:45,282 --> 01:35:47,827
If you don't have the money,
return the fabric

892
01:35:50,329 --> 01:35:52,665
I already made it
into a kimono

893
01:35:52,832 --> 01:35:54,583
Already?

894
01:35:56,585 --> 01:36:00,214
In that case,
I'll take the kimono

895
01:36:01,132 --> 01:36:04,343
Jihei, you and I
aren't strangers

896
01:36:04,510 --> 01:36:08,055
How can you be so cold?
Here you go

897
01:36:09,014 --> 01:36:10,433
Cold?

898
01:36:11,684 --> 01:36:13,602
I'm not Bunkichi

899
01:36:13,727 --> 01:36:16,272
I can't be seduced
by a whore like you,

900
01:36:16,397 --> 01:36:18,065
so pay up

901
01:36:18,190 --> 01:36:20,109
What did you call me?

902
01:36:20,526 --> 01:36:22,695
Fine, I'll return it

903
01:36:23,863 --> 01:36:25,906
Is that the kimono
you made?

904
01:36:29,994 --> 01:36:31,662
And the sash too

905
01:36:35,666 --> 01:36:37,626
No need to undress

906
01:36:39,086 --> 01:36:40,713
Here's the kimono

907
01:36:53,058 --> 01:36:54,935
Now hurry up and leave

908
01:37:22,046 --> 01:37:25,049
This is going to take
longer than I thought

909
01:37:26,425 --> 01:37:28,260
Take this money

910
01:37:29,929 --> 01:37:32,097
and get yourself
some tea and cake

911
01:37:32,223 --> 01:37:35,684
Drink as much tea
as you can, okay?

912
01:37:38,646 --> 01:37:40,189
Understand?

913
01:38:08,384 --> 01:38:11,637
Oharu,
you must be very tired

914
01:38:40,416 --> 01:38:42,001
Please leave!

915
01:38:42,167 --> 01:38:45,087
I don't want to see your face
Leave at once!

916
01:38:46,213 --> 01:38:48,841
I'm not the kind of woman
you think

917
01:38:49,008 --> 01:38:51,677
He was trying to rape me

918
01:38:51,844 --> 01:38:55,139
Please believe me, sister
I beg of you!

919
01:38:56,849 --> 01:39:00,269
I really believed
you wanted to become a nun

920
01:39:00,644 --> 01:39:03,272
You were just making
a fool of me

921
01:39:05,774 --> 01:39:10,154
Did you really think
you could get away with it?

922
01:39:11,905 --> 01:39:14,533
What kind of person are you?

923
01:39:23,876 --> 01:39:25,711
Get out!

924
01:39:26,879 --> 01:39:29,632
Get out!

925
01:41:02,099 --> 01:41:03,726
Oharu

926
01:41:06,478 --> 01:41:08,188
What's the matter?

927
01:41:08,355 --> 01:41:11,150
I've been driven
out of the temple

928
01:41:11,483 --> 01:41:14,236
What? You too?

929
01:41:18,490 --> 01:41:22,035
I was dismissed too

930
01:41:22,327 --> 01:41:24,329
You were?

931
01:41:38,510 --> 01:41:42,681
Oharu, come with me
I know I can make you happy

932
01:41:42,848 --> 01:41:44,683
What?

933
01:41:44,850 --> 01:41:46,435
Don't worry about money

934
01:41:46,560 --> 01:41:50,689
<i>When I left,
I stole 50 ryo in gold</i>

935
01:41:51,482 --> 01:41:53,692
What? Bunkichi!

936
01:41:53,859 --> 01:41:56,403
They all think I ran off
with you anyway

937
01:41:56,570 --> 01:41:59,907
No! I won't go
with a thief like you

938
01:42:00,282 --> 01:42:01,992
I can't! No!

939
01:42:22,554 --> 01:42:24,389
Would you like some?

940
01:42:24,556 --> 01:42:26,517
It's very good

941
01:42:29,895 --> 01:42:31,396
Wait a moment

942
01:42:34,525 --> 01:42:37,027
How about an egg?

943
01:42:42,991 --> 01:42:44,743
I'm at a loss

944
01:42:49,498 --> 01:42:51,792
May I have one of these?

945
01:42:51,959 --> 01:42:54,044
Oharu, these are good!

946
01:42:54,169 --> 01:42:56,255
- Bunkichi!
- Jihei!

947
01:42:56,421 --> 01:42:59,258
He's the thief!
Catch him!

948
01:42:59,424 --> 01:43:01,718
Stop! Come back!

949
01:43:03,971 --> 01:43:05,472
Jihei!

950
01:43:09,268 --> 01:43:10,936
Stop!

951
01:43:11,103 --> 01:43:13,146
Please let him go!

952
01:43:13,313 --> 01:43:15,190
Out of the way!

953
01:43:15,732 --> 01:43:17,734
- Oharu!
- You wench!

954
01:43:18,110 --> 01:43:21,029
Go off somewhere and die,
you rotten whore!

955
01:43:21,488 --> 01:43:24,283
Oharu!

956
01:43:42,009 --> 01:43:47,306
<i>This fleeting world</i>

957
01:43:49,057 --> 01:43:54,646
<i>Is full of pain</i>

958
01:44:04,656 --> 01:44:10,996
<i>And I, oh I</i>

959
01:44:25,510 --> 01:44:32,893
<i>Am a thing of pity</i>

960
01:44:34,353 --> 01:44:39,608
<i>This life</i>

961
01:44:40,025 --> 01:44:45,113
<i>So full of regrets</i>

962
01:45:10,055 --> 01:45:16,895
<i>Will vanish</i>

963
01:45:19,898 --> 01:45:24,027
<i>Like the morning dew</i>

964
01:49:28,980 --> 01:49:31,274
What's the matter?

965
01:49:32,609 --> 01:49:34,152
What's wrong?

966
01:49:36,321 --> 01:49:40,200
Come along with us
and take a rest

967
01:49:40,367 --> 01:49:42,619
Yes, let's go

968
01:49:43,828 --> 01:49:45,789
Come along

969
01:49:55,298 --> 01:49:57,300
I'll carry it for you

970
01:50:01,763 --> 01:50:04,266
I'll get that too

971
01:50:42,220 --> 01:50:45,056
She hasn't eaten
in three days,

972
01:50:45,390 --> 01:50:47,726
and she's chilled
to the bone

973
01:50:49,227 --> 01:50:51,479
Help yourself to the food

974
01:50:55,233 --> 01:50:58,528
Your hair's turned
really gray

975
01:50:59,237 --> 01:51:01,031
Yes, it has

976
01:51:01,156 --> 01:51:04,075
Here we are,
covered with wrinkles

977
01:51:05,452 --> 01:51:08,455
yet we try to coo
like young maidens:

978
01:51:08,580 --> 01:51:12,250
"Hey there, handsome!"

979
01:51:15,211 --> 01:51:17,756
What nerve we have!

980
01:51:36,274 --> 01:51:38,902
You wanna earn
some money too?

981
01:51:40,278 --> 01:51:42,447
It'll take your mind off things

982
01:51:43,198 --> 01:51:47,577
I'm too old for that,
unlike you

983
01:51:49,329 --> 01:51:52,290
Listen to her,
acting all innocent!

984
01:51:52,457 --> 01:51:54,626
It's a pitiful life we lead,

985
01:51:54,751 --> 01:51:58,797
but nobody's
going to help us out

986
01:51:58,963 --> 01:52:00,673
Ain't that the truth!

987
01:52:00,965 --> 01:52:04,636
It would be easier just to die,
but we can't even do that

988
01:52:04,761 --> 01:52:08,807
Drink the sake while we have it
It'll lift your spirits

989
01:52:09,224 --> 01:52:12,018
We've fallen this far

990
01:52:12,143 --> 01:52:14,562
Might as well do
what we want

991
01:52:15,980 --> 01:52:18,525
I can get you some clothes

992
01:52:19,067 --> 01:52:20,944
What do you say?

993
01:52:21,111 --> 01:52:22,529
Come on

994
01:52:22,654 --> 01:52:25,573
Whatever we do,
the world's not about to change

995
01:52:25,740 --> 01:52:27,575
That's right!

996
01:52:36,501 --> 01:52:40,130
Old man,
we've got a newcomer

997
01:52:40,296 --> 01:52:42,090
Bring her something to wear

998
01:53:09,951 --> 01:53:11,619
Are you the newcomer?

999
01:53:12,370 --> 01:53:14,956
You could probably
make good money

1000
01:53:16,458 --> 01:53:18,877
I'll rent you a kimono
and undergarments

1001
01:53:19,043 --> 01:53:20,879
<i>for three bu a night</i>

1002
01:53:21,045 --> 01:53:23,756
<i>A sash and socks
will be one bu.</i>

1003
01:53:23,923 --> 01:53:26,551
<i>Footwear will be five mon.</i>

1004
01:53:29,554 --> 01:53:31,890
This is so gaudy

1005
01:53:33,308 --> 01:53:35,602
What's wrong with it?

1006
01:53:35,768 --> 01:53:39,063
You can't make money
if they don't notice you

1007
01:53:40,398 --> 01:53:43,234
I expect payment soon,

1008
01:53:43,359 --> 01:53:45,361
so hurry up and get to work

1009
01:53:47,071 --> 01:53:49,407
If you're done here,
go away

1010
01:53:49,574 --> 01:53:51,326
Nasty old man

1011
01:53:55,288 --> 01:53:58,541
Come on
I'll help you get dressed

1012
01:54:45,296 --> 01:54:48,550
Hey, mister, wait a minute

1013
01:54:50,510 --> 01:54:54,097
Why don't we have some fun?

1014
01:54:55,848 --> 01:54:57,767
Old hag! Are you crazy?

1015
01:55:23,585 --> 01:55:25,670
Hey, handsome!

1016
01:55:28,298 --> 01:55:30,717
Come on,
let's have some fun

1017
01:55:30,883 --> 01:55:32,010
Go away!

1018
01:55:32,135 --> 01:55:34,846
- I'll give you your money's worth!
- I said no!

1019
01:56:38,618 --> 01:56:42,413
Madam, would you come
with me for a moment?

1020
01:56:43,289 --> 01:56:46,417
Certainly

1021
01:56:59,305 --> 01:57:01,766
Come in

1022
01:57:05,520 --> 01:57:07,397
Sit down over there

1023
01:57:17,448 --> 01:57:19,450
Cold, isn't it?

1024
01:57:34,590 --> 01:57:37,135
Shall I sing you a song?

1025
01:57:42,598 --> 01:57:45,768
Is there something wrong?

1026
01:57:46,352 --> 01:57:49,772
Your silence
makes me uneasy

1027
01:57:50,273 --> 01:57:53,443
Don't worry about it

1028
01:57:53,609 --> 01:57:55,820
You can just sit there

1029
01:57:59,949 --> 01:58:02,493
Please drop the fake voice

1030
01:58:02,660 --> 01:58:05,496
I'd really prefer it

1031
01:58:05,663 --> 01:58:08,124
if you spoke
in your natural voice

1032
01:58:09,751 --> 01:58:12,837
Come this way

1033
01:58:31,689 --> 01:58:35,026
Everybody
take a good long look

1034
01:58:47,038 --> 01:58:48,539
You see that?

1035
01:58:49,165 --> 01:58:52,835
You still want to sleep
with women now?

1036
01:58:55,838 --> 01:58:59,550
You all want happiness
in the next world

1037
01:58:59,717 --> 01:59:03,721
That's why you're on
the Thirty-three Temple Pilgrimage

1038
01:59:04,555 --> 01:59:06,390
However

1039
01:59:07,225 --> 01:59:12,188
if you'd rather steep yourself
in the impermanence of earthly life,

1040
01:59:13,439 --> 01:59:15,858
then follow the example

1041
01:59:17,485 --> 01:59:21,823
of this goblin cat
in human form

1042
01:59:26,619 --> 01:59:30,665
Thank you for coming
That will be all

1043
01:59:46,764 --> 01:59:48,599
Now please go

1044
02:00:22,884 --> 02:00:25,720
When you return
to your homes,

1045
02:00:26,762 --> 02:00:31,309
you can tell everyone
how you met a real goblin cat

1046
02:01:03,799 --> 02:01:06,010
Thanks a lot

1047
02:03:03,794 --> 02:03:05,713
What are you doing?

1048
02:03:09,175 --> 02:03:11,469
Looking at a statue
of an arhat

1049
02:03:13,971 --> 02:03:15,556
It looks like him

1050
02:03:15,723 --> 02:03:17,349
Like who?

1051
02:03:17,808 --> 02:03:20,102
Think of men you know

1052
02:03:20,895 --> 02:03:23,606
and try to find their faces
among the statues

1053
02:03:24,523 --> 02:03:26,942
You'll find quite a few

1054
02:03:47,296 --> 02:03:49,715
She's right!

1055
02:03:50,007 --> 02:03:52,426
They all have
such funny faces!

1056
02:04:48,566 --> 02:04:50,860
Oharu, what's wrong?

1057
02:05:38,616 --> 02:05:41,827
Look, it's your mother

1058
02:05:42,286 --> 02:05:44,538
I think she's waking up

1059
02:05:51,670 --> 02:05:55,716
I'm so glad to see you

1060
02:06:00,179 --> 02:06:02,223
Why have you come?

1061
02:06:02,389 --> 02:06:06,727
Someone told her
they saw you around here

1062
02:06:06,894 --> 02:06:09,063
She's been looking for you

1063
02:06:09,480 --> 02:06:13,359
I'm glad
to know you're safe

1064
02:06:18,781 --> 02:06:20,449
How is Father?

1065
02:06:21,784 --> 02:06:23,786
He passed away

1066
02:06:24,536 --> 02:06:28,290
He worried about you
to the very end

1067
02:06:34,505 --> 02:06:37,383
But don't cry

1068
02:06:38,550 --> 02:06:42,304
You'll find happiness again

1069
02:06:47,059 --> 02:06:49,728
Me? Happiness?

1070
02:06:50,980 --> 02:06:52,648
It's true

1071
02:06:53,732 --> 02:06:56,986
You won't have
to suffer anymore

1072
02:06:57,111 --> 02:07:00,155
You'll live in a big manor

1073
02:07:01,907 --> 02:07:05,411
A messenger came
from the Matsudaira palace

1074
02:07:05,744 --> 02:07:08,580
He said Lord Matsudaira
passed away

1075
02:07:08,872 --> 02:07:12,584
The young lord
has succeeded him

1076
02:07:14,211 --> 02:07:15,713
My son?

1077
02:07:17,172 --> 02:07:19,758
He's Lord Matsudaira now

1078
02:07:19,925 --> 02:07:22,511
The messenger said

1079
02:07:22,678 --> 02:07:26,890
the young lord wants his mother
to live with him in the palace

1080
02:07:27,016 --> 02:07:30,060
You mean
I'll get to see my son?

1081
02:07:31,186 --> 02:07:34,023
I can live with him?

1082
02:07:45,284 --> 02:07:47,286
Thank goodness

1083
02:07:50,956 --> 02:07:55,127
He's grown
into a good young man

1084
02:08:32,664 --> 02:08:37,169
I'd like Shinozaki and Tashiro
to deliver a stern rebuke

1085
02:08:44,593 --> 02:08:47,513
Have you forgotten
your debt of gratitude

1086
02:08:47,679 --> 02:08:50,391
to our late lord?

1087
02:08:51,141 --> 02:08:53,143
Who do you take us for?

1088
02:08:53,310 --> 02:08:57,439
The family line runs
from Tsunemoto Genji,

1089
02:08:57,564 --> 02:09:00,526
grandson of Emperor Seiwa,
through the Nitta clan

1090
02:09:00,692 --> 02:09:03,737
The lords of our clan
are direct descendants

1091
02:09:03,904 --> 02:09:08,492
of the great
Ieyasu Tokugawa

1092
02:09:08,826 --> 02:09:11,161
The late lord
was fourth in line

1093
02:09:11,286 --> 02:09:14,164
His son Yoshitaka is fifth

1094
02:09:14,373 --> 02:09:17,835
You were
the late lord's concubine,

1095
02:09:17,960 --> 02:09:20,379
but you reduced yourself
to a courtesan

1096
02:09:20,546 --> 02:09:22,714
and finally a prostitute

1097
02:09:22,840 --> 02:09:26,301
Do you have any excuse?
Are you not ashamed?

1098
02:09:26,427 --> 02:09:29,805
If word of your vulgar behavior
were to get out,

1099
02:09:29,930 --> 02:09:33,725
it would besmirch
the clan's name,

1100
02:09:33,851 --> 02:09:38,313
and the shogunate's punishment
would be severe

1101
02:09:38,439 --> 02:09:41,733
We cannot allow you
to come and go as you please

1102
02:09:41,900 --> 02:09:45,404
You are sentenced
to lifetime confinement

1103
02:09:46,738 --> 02:09:51,326
You must spend day and night
repenting for your sins

1104
02:09:51,493 --> 02:09:54,955
and beseeching the spirit
of our late lord for forgiveness

1105
02:09:55,164 --> 02:09:56,957
Now

1106
02:09:57,082 --> 02:10:00,335
in an exceptional
display of mercy,

1107
02:10:00,461 --> 02:10:03,922
His Lordship will grant you
a brief viewing

1108
02:10:05,299 --> 02:10:07,593
so that you may
bid him farewell

1109
02:11:33,720 --> 02:11:35,973
Keep your distance!
This is a serious affront!

1110
02:11:38,392 --> 02:11:42,563
Please allow me
to approach him

1111
02:11:54,283 --> 02:11:57,953
He's my child
I gave birth to him

1112
02:12:02,708 --> 02:12:04,376
Remember our orders!

1113
02:12:05,419 --> 02:12:07,421
I'm going after her!

1114
02:12:44,333 --> 02:12:46,084
<i>You there!</i>

1115
02:12:50,505 --> 02:12:52,299
Isn't she ready yet?

1116
02:12:52,591 --> 02:12:55,636
- Any minute, sir
- What's taking so long?

1117
02:13:03,060 --> 02:13:04,728
What is it?

1118
02:13:05,437 --> 02:13:07,105
We've lost her

1119
02:13:07,397 --> 02:13:10,192
How can that be?
Spread out and find her

1120
02:13:10,734 --> 02:13:12,402
Inform the others!

1121
02:13:13,153 --> 02:13:16,573
Spread out
and look for her!

1122
02:13:21,495 --> 02:13:23,830
The woman has disappeared!

1123
02:13:23,955 --> 02:13:25,707
Disappeared?

1124
02:13:25,832 --> 02:13:27,918
Find her at once!

1125
02:15:28,079 --> 02:15:33,001
<i>Sentient beings
are innumerable</i>

1126
02:15:33,126 --> 02:15:37,172
<i>I vow to save them</i>

1127
02:15:38,924 --> 02:15:43,595
<i>Delusions are inexhaustible</i>

1128
02:15:43,929 --> 02:15:48,850
<i>I vow to extinguish them</i>

1129
02:15:49,309 --> 02:15:53,772
<i>The teachings of the dharma
are immeasurable</i>

1130
02:15:54,397 --> 02:15:59,778
<i>I vow to master them</i>

1131
02:16:00,695 --> 02:16:05,784
<i>Buddhahood is incomparable</i>

1132
02:16:06,409 --> 02:16:10,622
<i>I vow to attain it</i>

1133
02:16:12,624 --> 02:16:17,921
<i>Buddhahood is incomparable</i>

1134
02:16:22,384 --> 02:16:28,598
<i>I vow to attain it</i>

1135
02:16:36,273 --> 02:16:40,318
THE END
