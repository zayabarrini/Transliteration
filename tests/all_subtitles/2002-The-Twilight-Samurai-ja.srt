Directed by
Yoji Yamada

4
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:30,290
Not that way.

5
00:01:34,590 --> 00:01:36,130
No, no, no!

6
00:01:43,350 --> 00:01:46,310
Thank you. You may go.

7
00:02:00,240 --> 00:02:04,120
After a long illness
my mother died...

8
00:02:04,450 --> 00:02:07,540
...when I was five.

9
00:02:08,080 --> 00:02:11,750
She had consumption...

10
00:02:12,040 --> 00:02:17,210
...so from when I can remember
I wasn't allowed near her.

11
00:02:17,590 --> 00:02:23,180
Thus I have almost no memory
of my mother.

12
00:02:31,350 --> 00:02:33,770
Ito...Ito...

13
00:02:34,650 --> 00:02:37,610
You poor little darling!

14
00:02:59,760 --> 00:03:06,350
I am from Unasaka, in the northeast
in what is now Yamagata Prefecture.

15
00:03:06,970 --> 00:03:10,140
Before 1868 it was the castle town
of the Unasaka clan...

16
00:03:10,480 --> 00:03:15,110
...a small fief of 70,000 koku
of rice per year.

17
00:03:38,380 --> 00:03:40,760
Well done, one and all.

18
00:03:41,550 --> 00:03:44,640
That's it for today.

19
00:03:51,140 --> 00:03:52,560
Sakaguchi...

20
00:03:53,440 --> 00:03:57,810
I've heard there's a good
drinking place in Hakkenmachi...

21
00:03:58,480 --> 00:04:00,480
Oh, you mean "Hisago"?

22
00:04:01,320 --> 00:04:02,490
Feel like a drink?

23
00:04:02,490 --> 00:04:03,990
A fine idea.

24
00:04:05,240 --> 00:04:07,820
Kawanami, will you come?

25
00:04:08,160 --> 00:04:09,490
I will.

26
00:04:09,490 --> 00:04:10,870
Iguchi?

27
00:04:11,790 --> 00:04:14,040
For a change?

28
00:04:14,420 --> 00:04:15,710
Not me, thanks.

29
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:17,750
We can't twist your arm?

30
00:04:17,960 --> 00:04:20,460
If you'll excuse me...

31
00:04:23,680 --> 00:04:27,550
Twilight's not very exciting,
is he?

32
00:04:37,730 --> 00:04:42,650
With a sick wife, two young daughters
and an aged mother in his care...

33
00:04:42,990 --> 00:04:47,570
...my father was unable
to drink with his colleagues.

34
00:04:47,870 --> 00:04:53,200
He had to hurry home
every evening at dusk.

35
00:05:03,130 --> 00:05:08,220
I was told the men
he worked with...

36
00:05:08,550 --> 00:05:14,520
...gave him the cruel nickname
of "Twilight Seibei".

37
00:05:16,190 --> 00:05:24,860
THE TWILIGHT SAMURAI

38
00:05:36,750 --> 00:05:37,710
Ito...

39
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:39,540
Father!

40
00:05:40,080 --> 00:05:42,420
Up you go!

41
00:05:47,800 --> 00:05:49,590
Your face is dirty.

42
00:06:06,740 --> 00:06:08,490
Father's back!

43
00:06:08,610 --> 00:06:10,410
Welcome home.

44
00:06:16,330 --> 00:06:20,290
Codfish stew tonight, Kayano?

45
00:06:22,960 --> 00:06:24,290
Don't drop it.

46
00:06:26,960 --> 00:06:32,010
I'm home, Mother
How are you this evening?

47
00:06:32,260 --> 00:06:35,180
Of what household are you, sir?

48
00:06:36,430 --> 00:06:40,690
I am Seibei Iguchi of the
Unasaka Clan, Castle Stores.

49
00:06:40,810 --> 00:06:42,560
I see...

50
00:06:45,270 --> 00:06:51,780
She's getting worse. She doesn't
even know her own son!

51
00:06:59,870 --> 00:07:03,710
Kayano, I've simmered
some burdock. Take some.

52
00:07:03,960 --> 00:07:06,380
Thank you. You're always
so kind to my daughters.

53
00:07:08,090 --> 00:07:11,840
Naota...you can go home now.

54
00:07:12,090 --> 00:07:13,140
Yup.

55
00:07:27,900 --> 00:07:31,190
Good evening.

56
00:07:31,610 --> 00:07:35,910
But Yazaki, can't we do something
about Twilight?

57
00:07:36,410 --> 00:07:40,700
His kimono's all ripped
and hardly ever takes a bath.

58
00:07:40,750 --> 00:07:43,420
There's this smell
when you get close to him.

59
00:07:44,630 --> 00:07:46,630
It just won't do!

60
00:07:47,250 --> 00:07:50,420
Yes, sir. We all find it
very hard to stomach.

61
00:07:50,760 --> 00:07:53,720
We've asked around about
finding him a new wife...

62
00:07:53,760 --> 00:07:57,390
...but no woman would want
his situation.

63
00:07:57,640 --> 00:07:59,100
Indeed!

64
00:07:59,430 --> 00:08:01,810
He's got two young girls
a senile old mother...

65
00:08:02,100 --> 00:08:06,730
...and 20 of his 50 koku
gone in debt.

66
00:08:07,060 --> 00:08:11,190
Any woman who went to him
would have to take in work.

67
00:08:11,860 --> 00:08:14,700
Yes, he owes money
all over the place.

68
00:08:15,030 --> 00:08:18,660
I don't know how he paid for
his wife's funeral.

69
00:08:18,950 --> 00:08:23,120
Not even selling your sword
would pay for a funeral like that.

70
00:08:24,790 --> 00:08:27,040
A funeral! That's something
I have to worry about, too.

71
00:08:27,290 --> 00:08:31,130
My father's not going to
last much longer.

72
00:08:32,090 --> 00:08:37,300
Kawanami's lucky.
Young parents and a pretty wife!

73
00:08:37,600 --> 00:08:42,100
You'd better go easy with her.
It could hurt your work.

74
00:08:42,480 --> 00:08:46,980
Is that why you're always
cat-napping on the job?

75
00:08:47,770 --> 00:08:49,560
I am not!

76
00:08:49,860 --> 00:08:51,530
Listen to him!

77
00:08:51,780 --> 00:08:53,030
Kumi...

78
00:08:53,360 --> 00:08:54,780
Welcome!

79
00:08:54,820 --> 00:08:57,070
Isn't she gorgeous!

80
00:08:57,320 --> 00:08:58,870
Kume...

81
00:09:24,230 --> 00:09:26,100
Bed-time, Gran.

82
00:09:28,520 --> 00:09:31,060
Good night, Seibei.

83
00:09:31,360 --> 00:09:33,690
Good night.

84
00:09:35,650 --> 00:09:38,950
It looks like
she remembered me.

85
00:09:40,780 --> 00:09:46,910
"The Master said: To rule a land
of a thousand chariots..."

86
00:09:47,160 --> 00:09:48,750
Kayano...

87
00:09:49,000 --> 00:09:53,460
That's Confucius, isn't it?
When did you start learning that?

88
00:09:53,710 --> 00:09:57,840
At the end of last month.
The teacher says...

89
00:09:57,930 --> 00:10:01,180
...from now on even girls
will need book learning.

90
00:10:01,510 --> 00:10:03,390
That's good.

91
00:10:03,810 --> 00:10:07,890
When I was a boy I read Confucius
over and over again.

92
00:10:12,440 --> 00:10:13,940
Father...

93
00:10:15,030 --> 00:10:17,070
If I learn to do
needlework...

94
00:10:17,190 --> 00:10:23,490
...someday I can make kimonos.

95
00:10:24,580 --> 00:10:29,000
But what good will
book learning ever do me?

96
00:10:30,040 --> 00:10:39,970
Well, it probably won't ever be
as useful as needlework.

97
00:10:43,550 --> 00:10:45,720
But you know...

98
00:10:45,890 --> 00:10:51,850
...book learning gives you
the power...

99
00:10:51,900 --> 00:10:54,610
...to think.

100
00:10:54,900 --> 00:11:00,950
However the world might change,
if you have the power to think...

101
00:11:00,990 --> 00:11:03,990
...you'll always survive somehow.

102
00:11:04,280 --> 00:11:08,290
That's true for boys
and for girls.

103
00:11:09,960 --> 00:11:11,330
All right?

104
00:11:11,540 --> 00:11:13,080
Yes.

105
00:11:14,920 --> 00:11:17,630
Keep reading, then.

106
00:11:17,710 --> 00:11:22,550
"Tseng Tzu said: Each day
in three ways...

107
00:11:22,890 --> 00:11:25,010
"...I ask myself...

108
00:11:25,510 --> 00:11:30,390
"...if I have faithfully carried out
what I undertook for another..."

109
00:11:30,770 --> 00:11:34,560
My mother's illness had left
my father deep in debt.

110
00:11:34,810 --> 00:11:40,030
As Grandmother lost her wits, all the
housework, the gathering of fuel...

111
00:11:40,280 --> 00:11:45,070
...and the field work fell to him.

112
00:11:45,370 --> 00:11:49,370
Left with little time
to attend to himself...

113
00:11:49,790 --> 00:11:54,000
...he gradually became
unkempt and grimy.

114
00:11:55,630 --> 00:12:02,300
As his daughter, I felt terrible
about this.

115
00:12:03,970 --> 00:12:05,680
Wipe off that dust!

116
00:12:07,930 --> 00:12:10,100
They're coming!

117
00:12:12,100 --> 00:12:14,020
His Lordship attends!

118
00:12:14,440 --> 00:12:16,980
Kawanami! Quick!

119
00:12:17,610 --> 00:12:19,980
Provisions.

120
00:12:20,150 --> 00:12:26,240
Vital stores of food for when
the clan must fight, or the castle...

121
00:12:26,620 --> 00:12:29,030
...is besieged.

122
00:12:29,120 --> 00:12:32,910
Next we have the Salt Storehouse...

123
00:12:37,210 --> 00:12:41,550
Here you have your beans
green, soy and red...

124
00:12:42,050 --> 00:12:46,380
We pay particular attention
to keeping them dry.

125
00:12:46,760 --> 00:12:50,760
Dried giant horse-radish
dried fiddleheads, miso paste...

126
00:12:51,020 --> 00:12:53,270
Kusaka!

127
00:12:56,060 --> 00:12:59,150
This is dried codfish...

128
00:12:59,440 --> 00:13:03,360
...very important provisioning
in times of war.

129
00:13:03,610 --> 00:13:06,070
How much have we got?

130
00:13:06,990 --> 00:13:08,410
Iguchi...

131
00:13:13,120 --> 00:13:17,370
Iguchi? You may answer
directly.

132
00:13:19,840 --> 00:13:24,630
By your leave. We have
760 strips...

133
00:13:24,970 --> 00:13:27,930
...by weight approximately
120 kan.

134
00:13:28,220 --> 00:13:30,430
How long does it keep?

135
00:13:31,470 --> 00:13:33,930
Between five and ten years.

136
00:13:34,180 --> 00:13:37,190
This here is the oldest
we have.

137
00:13:37,480 --> 00:13:40,610
It was acquired
six years ago.

138
00:13:41,150 --> 00:13:46,610
This dried cod from Kansaki is best.
It holds its taste for ten years.

139
00:13:51,870 --> 00:13:56,080
That strange smell I noticed,
is it you?

140
00:14:01,250 --> 00:14:06,920
Clan retainers must serve
as examples to the common folk.

141
00:14:07,220 --> 00:14:09,090
Keep yourself clean.

142
00:14:10,140 --> 00:14:12,760
Yes, Milord!

143
00:14:13,430 --> 00:14:15,390
Carry on.

144
00:14:19,400 --> 00:14:20,940
Idiot!

145
00:14:31,570 --> 00:14:33,160
Sir, I...

146
00:14:33,200 --> 00:14:35,200
I'll speak to you later.

147
00:14:35,540 --> 00:14:36,240
But...

148
00:14:36,290 --> 00:14:37,500
Be quiet!

149
00:14:42,630 --> 00:14:44,130
Iguchi!

150
00:14:46,210 --> 00:14:49,590
You damn fool!

151
00:14:52,180 --> 00:14:56,430
The story spread
throughout the castle.

152
00:14:56,890 --> 00:15:01,350
My father became
a laughingstock.

153
00:15:09,360 --> 00:15:15,780
My Great-Uncle came from
the main house in a foul humor.

154
00:15:21,330 --> 00:15:25,790
Hello!

155
00:15:27,050 --> 00:15:28,760
Seibei!

156
00:15:29,510 --> 00:15:31,550
It's Uncle...

157
00:15:32,760 --> 00:15:34,970
I'm in for it now.

158
00:15:35,760 --> 00:15:40,100
Is anybody here?
What, are you all dead?!

159
00:15:40,350 --> 00:15:41,730
Coming!

160
00:15:42,980 --> 00:15:45,150
Kayano, make some tea.

161
00:15:45,190 --> 00:15:46,230
Who is it?

162
00:15:46,270 --> 00:15:47,900
Great-Uncle!

163
00:15:49,440 --> 00:15:53,780
Disgraceful!

164
00:15:54,110 --> 00:15:57,870
You appeared before His Lordship
unbathed, smelling like dried cod.

165
00:15:58,200 --> 00:15:59,330
The unpleasant impression
you created...

166
00:15:59,450 --> 00:16:04,370
...shames the house of Iguchi.

167
00:16:04,960 --> 00:16:07,670
That was inexcusable.

168
00:16:07,800 --> 00:16:14,510
I went to Senior Retainer Terauchi
and apologized for you.

169
00:16:14,840 --> 00:16:19,560
His Lordship is a generous man
so he did not find fault.

170
00:16:19,770 --> 00:16:23,230
Had that been his father, though...

171
00:16:23,520 --> 00:16:25,770
...this would have meant
hara-kiri!

172
00:16:25,810 --> 00:16:29,730
I never dreamed
it would cause so much trouble.

173
00:16:30,070 --> 00:16:32,360
I beg your forgiveness.

174
00:16:33,360 --> 00:16:34,950
Kayano?

175
00:16:36,280 --> 00:16:38,240
How old are you now?

176
00:16:38,580 --> 00:16:40,580
I am ten years old.

177
00:16:41,250 --> 00:16:44,660
Are you working at
your lessons?

178
00:16:45,750 --> 00:16:49,130
I'm learning needlework
and Confucius.

179
00:16:49,340 --> 00:16:52,960
A girl has no need
of the classics.

180
00:16:53,340 --> 00:16:56,380
All you need is
to write women's script.

181
00:16:56,470 --> 00:16:59,220
Too much book learning
and you'll never be a bride.

182
00:16:59,260 --> 00:17:01,470
You can go.

183
00:17:10,020 --> 00:17:15,360
I am here today
on an important matter.

184
00:17:16,990 --> 00:17:19,280
A marriage arrangement.

185
00:17:19,620 --> 00:17:25,410
You need a hard-working wife
to escape the misery you are in.

186
00:17:25,870 --> 00:17:30,170
A village-headman acquaintance
has an unmarried daughter...

187
00:17:30,500 --> 00:17:34,380
...whom he agrees
to marry to you.

188
00:17:34,420 --> 00:17:39,890
He knows you are poor, have two
young daughters and a senile mother.

189
00:17:40,100 --> 00:17:44,310
I'm sure you realize that you are
in no position to demand beauty.

190
00:17:44,350 --> 00:17:48,810
You need a healthy wife with
big haunches to bear children.

191
00:17:49,270 --> 00:17:52,270
Her face is of no concern.

192
00:17:52,320 --> 00:18:01,070
So I'll proceed with this,
if you don't mind.

193
00:18:01,990 --> 00:18:05,450
With all due respect
I must differ.

194
00:18:05,750 --> 00:18:07,160
How?

195
00:18:07,460 --> 00:18:13,460
I am not nearly as miserable
in my living as you may think.

196
00:18:13,710 --> 00:18:17,920
Of course, offending His Lordship
by appearing unbathed before him...

197
00:18:18,220 --> 00:18:22,430
...was wrong, and I vow
never to repeat it.

198
00:18:24,680 --> 00:18:26,140
However...

199
00:18:27,060 --> 00:18:31,350
...watching my daughters
as they grow day by day is...

200
00:18:33,070 --> 00:18:35,440
...how shall I put it?

201
00:18:36,360 --> 00:18:43,120
It's like watching crops ripen
or flowers grow in a field.

202
00:18:44,790 --> 00:18:47,450
I enjoy it very much.

203
00:18:49,870 --> 00:18:53,130
I'm not sure if the lady
of whom you speak...

204
00:18:53,420 --> 00:18:57,550
...would understand that.

205
00:18:57,880 --> 00:19:01,340
Who would understand
such foolishness?!

206
00:19:03,470 --> 00:19:06,560
You've always been like this...

207
00:19:06,720 --> 00:19:11,850
...tormenting your poor father
with this prattling of yours!

208
00:19:12,480 --> 00:19:17,820
What has your marriage
got to do with crops in a field?

209
00:19:18,070 --> 00:19:21,400
Then I beg leave
to speak more clearly.

210
00:19:21,740 --> 00:19:26,740
I ask that you not concern yourself
with questions of my marriage.

211
00:19:27,660 --> 00:19:30,960
You defy the main branch
of your family?!

212
00:19:31,580 --> 00:19:34,130
You are welcome here.

213
00:19:36,170 --> 00:19:38,710
Kinu...are you well?

214
00:19:39,010 --> 00:19:41,170
I am, thank you.

215
00:19:41,510 --> 00:19:47,140
May I ask of which household
you come?

216
00:19:47,600 --> 00:19:49,430
I'm your damn brother!

217
00:19:49,470 --> 00:19:53,190
Take her away, Seibei.
She's a nuisance.

218
00:19:53,440 --> 00:19:55,190
Mother...

219
00:19:55,480 --> 00:19:59,610
Most unseemly! What will
the neighbors think?

220
00:19:59,650 --> 00:20:02,030
Tie her to a post somewhere!

221
00:20:06,450 --> 00:20:12,710
"Expect no more help from me!"...

222
00:20:13,000 --> 00:20:16,750
...shouted my great-uncle
as he left in high dudgeon.

223
00:20:18,840 --> 00:20:21,130
Can you do that?

224
00:20:21,720 --> 00:20:24,130
Let me see.

225
00:20:28,470 --> 00:20:32,600
Here...twist it
as you fit it in.

226
00:20:34,600 --> 00:20:36,350
Is Gran asleep?

227
00:20:36,520 --> 00:20:37,520
Yes.

228
00:20:38,980 --> 00:20:40,570
Good.

229
00:20:40,610 --> 00:20:42,440
Father...

230
00:20:43,070 --> 00:20:46,410
Gran was crying, you know.

231
00:20:46,660 --> 00:20:48,660
Uncle shouted at her.

232
00:20:50,660 --> 00:20:53,250
Poor Gran!

233
00:20:56,790 --> 00:20:59,590
Do you like Uncle?

234
00:21:01,340 --> 00:21:03,590
You don't?

235
00:21:06,970 --> 00:21:09,300
I hate him.

236
00:21:14,430 --> 00:21:20,980
He came to talk about a new wife
for me, but I said no.

237
00:21:22,320 --> 00:21:25,740
I don't want to take
any help from him.

238
00:21:26,820 --> 00:21:29,870
You'd think we were
buying a cow!

239
00:21:30,120 --> 00:21:36,540
"All she needs is to be healthy."
That's rude to the lady as well.

240
00:21:40,090 --> 00:21:42,420
Are you two lonely...

241
00:21:44,760 --> 00:21:47,800
...without a mother?

242
00:21:49,760 --> 00:21:52,510
I'm not lonely, if you're here.

243
00:21:52,760 --> 00:21:53,890
Me, too.

244
00:21:59,150 --> 00:22:00,860
That's my girls.

245
00:22:11,740 --> 00:22:14,040
Do you want the toilet, Gran?

246
00:22:41,610 --> 00:22:43,310
Look!

247
00:22:43,900 --> 00:22:47,230
Butterbur buds!
Get lots, all right?

248
00:22:52,700 --> 00:22:54,700
What's that?

249
00:22:56,540 --> 00:22:58,620
A child!

250
00:22:59,120 --> 00:23:02,830
The poor thing!
He's nothing but bones!

251
00:23:03,340 --> 00:23:05,710
Where'd he come from?

252
00:23:06,050 --> 00:23:08,550
Matsukawa, maybe.

253
00:23:08,670 --> 00:23:11,260
Rise to Buddha!

254
00:23:11,640 --> 00:23:15,760
As children
we loved to go gathering herbs...

255
00:23:16,100 --> 00:23:20,850
...by the river
in early spring.

256
00:23:21,140 --> 00:23:25,400
But those were times
of famine.

257
00:23:25,690 --> 00:23:28,440
The cold meltwater often brought
the bodies of peasants...

258
00:23:28,820 --> 00:23:31,820
...dead of starvation.

259
00:23:36,790 --> 00:23:38,700
Aim...

260
00:23:43,170 --> 00:23:45,130
Fire!

261
00:23:51,930 --> 00:23:53,630
All of you, watch me

262
00:23:53,890 --> 00:23:56,010
Elbows up...

263
00:23:56,640 --> 00:23:58,810
Brace the right knee...

264
00:23:59,060 --> 00:24:02,060
Seibei! Sorry to keep you
waiting.

265
00:24:05,310 --> 00:24:07,400
You went to Kyoto?

266
00:24:07,650 --> 00:24:11,280
Yes, with the Majordomo to talk
to merchants there and in Osaka.

267
00:24:11,530 --> 00:24:13,780
What's Kyoto like?

268
00:24:14,660 --> 00:24:18,700
I had high hopes for it
but it was horrible.

269
00:24:18,950 --> 00:24:21,790
I've never seen the like
of Miyako-oji Boulevard.

270
00:24:24,420 --> 00:24:28,040
Filthy masterless samurai from
all over the country everywhere...

271
00:24:28,380 --> 00:24:32,840
...cursing and swearing
in dialects you can't understand.

272
00:24:32,970 --> 00:24:37,180
Then someone shouts "Divine
punishment!" and the swords come out.

273
00:24:40,720 --> 00:24:47,190
The Kamo River's full of headless
corpses all swollen up...

274
00:24:47,690 --> 00:24:51,230
I thought it'd be geishas in Gion...

275
00:24:55,910 --> 00:24:57,450
Dear me!

276
00:25:00,330 --> 00:25:01,830
Prime!

277
00:25:02,950 --> 00:25:04,960
Aim!

278
00:25:05,540 --> 00:25:07,710
Fire!

279
00:25:08,000 --> 00:25:09,840
Misfire!

280
00:25:10,920 --> 00:25:12,710
Wait! What's wrong?

281
00:25:14,720 --> 00:25:16,090
Ow!

282
00:25:16,300 --> 00:25:18,640
Fool!

283
00:25:18,930 --> 00:25:21,100
I told you to wait!

284
00:25:21,810 --> 00:25:24,890
They're a bit late.

285
00:25:25,940 --> 00:25:28,600
The Choshu clan may have been
beaten once,

286
00:25:28,900 --> 00:25:31,400
but they'll be back with Satsuma.

287
00:25:31,730 --> 00:25:36,650
They'll snuff out 250 years of
Shoguns like the wind does a candle.

288
00:25:36,950 --> 00:25:38,910
What's our clan doing?

289
00:25:38,990 --> 00:25:42,080
Our leaders aren't thinking!

290
00:25:43,870 --> 00:25:47,330
How would you like
to go to Kyoto?

291
00:25:49,420 --> 00:25:52,040
The Emperor's palace
is short of guards.

292
00:25:52,340 --> 00:25:54,210
I'll recommend you.

293
00:25:54,550 --> 00:25:56,880
You'll see how things are.

294
00:25:57,180 --> 00:26:01,720
Someone like you shouldn't be
stuck in a field here right now.

295
00:26:01,970 --> 00:26:06,770
I'm afraid
you over-estimate me.

296
00:26:06,980 --> 00:26:09,900
The times are changing.

297
00:26:10,480 --> 00:26:16,990
When they do, I'll give up
samurai status and be a farmer.

298
00:26:17,780 --> 00:26:20,490
That's what I'm suited for.

299
00:26:23,790 --> 00:26:26,830
You're a strange one.

300
00:26:28,540 --> 00:26:31,880
But you always were.

301
00:26:33,960 --> 00:26:36,380
No ambition at all.

302
00:26:37,880 --> 00:26:40,180
Oh, I nearly forgot...

303
00:26:42,760 --> 00:26:47,350
My condolences
on your bereavement.

304
00:26:48,850 --> 00:26:51,100
Burn a joss stick for her.

305
00:26:51,400 --> 00:26:54,900
You didn't have to...

306
00:26:55,070 --> 00:26:58,320
I wanted to send my sister
to the funeral in my place,...

307
00:26:58,610 --> 00:27:02,820
...but she was having
some troubles of her own.

308
00:27:02,870 --> 00:27:03,910
I'm sorry.

309
00:27:04,160 --> 00:27:06,620
Miss Tomoe? What's wrong?

310
00:27:09,040 --> 00:27:13,920
You know she married the son
of Captain Koda...

311
00:27:13,960 --> 00:27:18,670
It turns out this Toyotaro
is a mean drunk.

312
00:27:18,970 --> 00:27:21,510
If I'd known
I'd never have agreed.

313
00:27:21,760 --> 00:27:23,470
A mean drunk?

314
00:27:23,510 --> 00:27:26,890
He'd hit her, kick her...

315
00:27:27,180 --> 00:27:31,060
She'd come running
to my house to get away.

316
00:27:31,230 --> 00:27:34,810
I was worried
one day he'd kill her...

317
00:27:35,020 --> 00:27:38,360
...so I got the Castle
to order them divorced.

318
00:27:38,690 --> 00:27:39,990
Divorced?

319
00:27:40,030 --> 00:27:41,950
Just recently.

320
00:27:42,200 --> 00:27:47,080
So now Tomoe's
back at my house.

321
00:27:48,160 --> 00:27:53,620
Really?

322
00:27:53,880 --> 00:27:58,460
And here I thought she was the wife
of a fine 1200-koku samurai.

323
00:27:58,960 --> 00:28:01,630
I had no idea.

324
00:28:02,590 --> 00:28:08,180
I made a mistake. She's gone
through hell because of me.

325
00:28:14,270 --> 00:28:16,940
Well done, one and all.

326
00:28:17,150 --> 00:28:20,820
That's it for today.

327
00:28:27,410 --> 00:28:29,030
Sakaguchi...

328
00:28:29,830 --> 00:28:33,710
Sakaguchi! Feel like
dropping in at "Hisago"?

329
00:28:33,960 --> 00:28:35,920
You want to see O-Kume!

330
00:28:35,960 --> 00:28:36,920
Quiet!

331
00:28:37,130 --> 00:28:38,840
You come too, Kawanami.

332
00:28:39,090 --> 00:28:40,000
Again?

333
00:28:40,050 --> 00:28:41,050
Damn right!

334
00:28:41,090 --> 00:28:43,010
I'll be going.

335
00:28:43,220 --> 00:28:44,550
Iguchi...

336
00:28:45,470 --> 00:28:48,680
You should come see the girls.
Take your mind off things.

337
00:28:48,930 --> 00:28:50,890
I'm fine, thanks.

338
00:28:54,310 --> 00:28:55,230
Iguchi...

339
00:28:55,480 --> 00:28:57,270
Don't waste your breath.

340
00:29:10,490 --> 00:29:12,790
Look, Naota. The azaleas are out.

341
00:29:12,950 --> 00:29:14,000
Yup.

342
00:29:23,630 --> 00:29:26,760
Kayano, Ito, I'm home!

343
00:29:29,140 --> 00:29:30,550
No one's here...

344
00:29:39,730 --> 00:29:41,980
Welcome home.

345
00:29:45,860 --> 00:29:48,240
It's been a long time.

346
00:29:53,910 --> 00:29:59,170
Uh...perhaps there's...um...

347
00:30:00,420 --> 00:30:05,760
You were out
when I came by...

348
00:30:08,680 --> 00:30:15,220
Have you forgotten me?
I'm Iinuma's younger sister, Tomoe.

349
00:30:17,230 --> 00:30:21,230
Oh, Miss Tomoe!

350
00:30:21,560 --> 00:30:24,070
I didn't know you.

351
00:30:25,190 --> 00:30:31,320
I've just seen your brother today.
He told me what had happened.

352
00:30:31,570 --> 00:30:36,450
So you know all about it, then?

353
00:30:37,120 --> 00:30:38,660
Yes.

354
00:30:39,670 --> 00:30:44,040
Because of that I'm back
living at his house.

355
00:30:44,090 --> 00:30:48,170
There's nothing for me to do
so they have me weaving.

356
00:30:48,340 --> 00:30:51,970
I came here to escape.

357
00:30:52,220 --> 00:30:54,010
You're very welcome.

358
00:30:55,060 --> 00:30:57,850
Let's go inside.

359
00:30:59,230 --> 00:31:00,690
Your sock...

360
00:31:00,940 --> 00:31:02,900
Oh, yes...

361
00:31:14,080 --> 00:31:17,200
It seems your father
had forgotten me!

362
00:31:17,450 --> 00:31:20,750
We always played together!

363
00:31:21,120 --> 00:31:23,750
Welcome home.

364
00:31:23,880 --> 00:31:30,300
Kayano, Ito, this is Miss Tomoe.
We're, uh...

365
00:31:30,340 --> 00:31:33,220
Childhood friends.
He always used to tease me.

366
00:31:33,470 --> 00:31:35,430
I did not!

367
00:31:35,810 --> 00:31:37,720
I got a present.

368
00:31:38,100 --> 00:31:39,680
Me, too.

369
00:31:39,930 --> 00:31:42,770
Aren't they pretty!

370
00:31:43,310 --> 00:31:45,110
Mother, I'm home.

371
00:31:45,360 --> 00:31:46,940
Welcome home.

372
00:31:47,230 --> 00:31:50,240
Do you know this lady?

373
00:31:50,950 --> 00:31:53,160
She's Miss Tomoe,
the Iinuma girl.

374
00:31:53,200 --> 00:31:55,240
See? She remembered me.

375
00:31:55,580 --> 00:32:01,460
That's good. And of course
you remember me, don't you?

376
00:32:02,920 --> 00:32:06,540
Of which household are you?

377
00:32:08,880 --> 00:32:11,130
I'm your son.

378
00:32:12,220 --> 00:32:14,050
You are, are you?

379
00:32:14,220 --> 00:32:16,010
Hello.

380
00:32:16,300 --> 00:32:18,810
Tane, watch the hotpot.

381
00:32:20,310 --> 00:32:27,650
It was as if our house was brighter
from the moment Miss Tomoe arrived.

382
00:32:29,780 --> 00:32:32,190
I've never forgotten.
It was when I was five.

383
00:32:32,280 --> 00:32:37,910
I always wanted to do
whatever the boys did.

384
00:32:38,200 --> 00:32:43,160
Once I was climbing a pine tree
and a branch broke...

385
00:32:43,210 --> 00:32:45,000
...and I got hurt.

386
00:32:45,250 --> 00:32:47,000
Really?

387
00:32:47,380 --> 00:32:50,750
Yes! Your father happened
to be there that day...

388
00:32:51,050 --> 00:32:56,300
...and he carried me piggy-back
all the way to the doctor!

389
00:32:56,470 --> 00:33:01,430
I think he was 12 or 13.

390
00:33:02,350 --> 00:33:06,650
His back was this big!

391
00:33:06,940 --> 00:33:12,730
Just like a grown-up's.
He made me feel so safe...

392
00:33:12,990 --> 00:33:15,240
Do you remember, Seibei?

393
00:33:15,860 --> 00:33:20,370
I remember
something like that...

394
00:33:22,120 --> 00:33:24,620
When I was nine
my mother told me...

395
00:33:25,250 --> 00:33:29,380
...I couldn't play
with boys any more.

396
00:33:29,460 --> 00:33:32,210
I was so sad...

397
00:33:33,460 --> 00:33:36,800
Being a girl’s no fun, Kayano.

398
00:33:37,050 --> 00:33:40,680
Drip, drip drip...

399
00:33:41,010 --> 00:33:44,220
...come our Chonbei's tears.

400
00:33:44,520 --> 00:33:46,440
Drip, drip, drip...

401
00:33:46,690 --> 00:33:51,020
Let's catch his falling tears...

402
00:33:51,360 --> 00:33:53,820
...and wipe them away...

403
00:33:54,240 --> 00:33:56,950
Wipe them away...

404
00:33:57,360 --> 00:34:01,660
Let's take his
tear-soaked kimono...

405
00:34:01,910 --> 00:34:02,700
...and wash it clean...

406
00:34:02,990 --> 00:34:04,580
Wash it clean...

407
00:34:04,830 --> 00:34:08,250
Let's take the kimono
we've washed...

408
00:34:08,540 --> 00:34:10,420
...and wring it out...

409
00:34:10,460 --> 00:34:12,250
Wring it out...

410
00:34:12,500 --> 00:34:16,300
Let's take the kimono
we've wrung out...

411
00:34:16,590 --> 00:34:18,430
...and hang it to dry...

412
00:34:18,550 --> 00:34:21,430
Hang it to dry...

413
00:34:26,430 --> 00:34:30,520
You haven't changed
at all, have you.

414
00:34:31,980 --> 00:34:37,190
It's as if I'm
a completely different person.

415
00:34:38,280 --> 00:34:41,160
That's not true.

416
00:34:41,490 --> 00:34:46,290
You still smile
just like you used to.

417
00:34:48,500 --> 00:34:54,500
You don't have to console me.
I know I've changed.

418
00:34:57,420 --> 00:35:01,640
People told me how radiant
a bride you were...

419
00:35:02,140 --> 00:35:04,470
...when you went to
the Koda house.

420
00:35:05,310 --> 00:35:07,430
I don't want to remember.

421
00:35:32,710 --> 00:35:37,300
It's very late.
I'll leave you here.

422
00:35:39,510 --> 00:35:43,090
Say hello to your brother.

423
00:35:44,640 --> 00:35:47,220
Your beard's growing out...

424
00:35:48,350 --> 00:35:50,140
It's so soft!

425
00:35:52,980 --> 00:35:54,810
Iinuma! I want the truth!

426
00:35:55,150 --> 00:35:57,070
That man's here!

427
00:35:57,320 --> 00:35:59,820
My husband...

428
00:36:02,990 --> 00:36:08,910
My ex-husband...I'd know
that drunken voice anywhere.

429
00:36:09,950 --> 00:36:11,500
I'm going!

430
00:36:11,910 --> 00:36:13,290
Your master's leaving.

431
00:36:13,370 --> 00:36:14,750
Hands off!

432
00:36:15,000 --> 00:36:16,000
I'm not drunk!

433
00:36:16,250 --> 00:36:19,420
My sandals!

434
00:36:19,670 --> 00:36:22,380
Iinuma! Where's Tomoe gone?

435
00:36:22,680 --> 00:36:25,140
I told you, she's at her aunt's.

436
00:36:25,340 --> 00:36:26,850
You're lying!

437
00:36:27,140 --> 00:36:31,180
Please! Keep your voice down!
There are elderly people here!

438
00:36:31,430 --> 00:36:32,520
To hell with her.

439
00:36:32,850 --> 00:36:34,900
Listen, Iinuma...

440
00:36:35,270 --> 00:36:39,820
If I'm not good enough for Tomoe,
she's welcome to leave.

441
00:36:40,030 --> 00:36:41,990
But Iinuma...

442
00:36:42,240 --> 00:36:44,990
...I've got a bone to pick
with you.

443
00:36:45,570 --> 00:36:49,450
You went to His Lordship
and got him to divorce us.

444
00:36:49,700 --> 00:36:54,250
Squire Koda, I've told you
time and time again...

445
00:36:54,540 --> 00:36:55,870
Shut up!

446
00:36:56,540 --> 00:37:01,460
You made me a joke
in front of the whole castle!

447
00:37:01,510 --> 00:37:04,720
I demand satisfaction!

448
00:37:05,010 --> 00:37:05,510
Squire Koda!

449
00:37:05,550 --> 00:37:06,340
My sword!

450
00:37:08,100 --> 00:37:10,510
Stop this, will you?!

451
00:37:11,720 --> 00:37:13,560
Tomoe...

452
00:37:14,480 --> 00:37:19,020
Where've you been
till this hour of the night?

453
00:37:19,270 --> 00:37:22,650
Where I go is no one's business
but mine.

454
00:37:22,900 --> 00:37:26,200
And I'll say this, too.

455
00:37:26,410 --> 00:37:31,580
I am not your wife now.
It's "Miss Tomoe" to you.

456
00:37:36,620 --> 00:37:39,580
Tomoe! Get inside!

457
00:37:42,260 --> 00:37:44,630
Perhaps that's enough?

458
00:37:45,550 --> 00:37:46,840
Who are you?!

459
00:37:53,720 --> 00:37:59,020
I am Seibei Iguchi,
friend to Iinuma.

460
00:37:59,400 --> 00:38:03,610
Perhaps I could accept
your challenge in his name?

461
00:38:03,650 --> 00:38:07,400
But here we are in the town.

462
00:38:07,860 --> 00:38:10,530
And you are drunk.

463
00:38:12,660 --> 00:38:18,160
Let's settle this another time,
when the alcohol has worn off.

464
00:38:23,800 --> 00:38:28,630
If you've put yourself forward
this way...

465
00:38:28,930 --> 00:38:31,260
...you must know how to fight.

466
00:38:31,510 --> 00:38:34,640
I make no such claim.

467
00:38:34,930 --> 00:38:39,060
Fine. We fight tomorrow.

468
00:38:40,350 --> 00:38:41,940
Tomorrow?

469
00:38:42,150 --> 00:38:49,610
By the river behind Hannyaji
Temple, at the 8th hour?

470
00:38:51,200 --> 00:38:52,700
Done.

471
00:38:53,280 --> 00:38:57,580
Behind Hannyaji, 8th hour.

472
00:38:59,040 --> 00:39:00,620
See you.

473
00:39:13,050 --> 00:39:17,220
Seibei, he's serious!

474
00:39:17,520 --> 00:39:19,310
Are you?

475
00:39:19,600 --> 00:39:21,520
I had no choice.

476
00:39:21,560 --> 00:39:23,730
He's good with a sword.

477
00:39:24,690 --> 00:39:27,110
It'll work out.

478
00:39:27,440 --> 00:39:29,570
I'll say good night.

479
00:39:29,780 --> 00:39:34,410
Don't tell Tomoe about this.

480
00:39:37,660 --> 00:39:43,120
Wait!

481
00:39:43,420 --> 00:39:46,710
What if you kill him?
The Clan forbids dueling.

482
00:39:47,510 --> 00:39:50,170
I'll think of something.

483
00:39:51,130 --> 00:39:52,550
Good night.

484
00:40:09,780 --> 00:40:11,610
Naota...

485
00:40:49,900 --> 00:40:51,820
We're going.

486
00:40:54,660 --> 00:40:55,780
Ito!

487
00:41:05,670 --> 00:41:11,000
Yu Tzu said: Harmony is the
greatest beneficence of the rites.

488
00:41:11,050 --> 00:41:14,920
Good morning.

489
00:41:22,810 --> 00:41:25,230
Sit down!

490
00:41:35,910 --> 00:41:37,860
I'm leaving.

491
00:42:29,790 --> 00:42:33,750
This is no good. I'm slow.

492
00:43:05,790 --> 00:43:08,120
You think you can take me?

493
00:43:08,370 --> 00:43:09,540
Damn right!

494
00:43:09,790 --> 00:43:12,750
Then get ready.

495
00:43:16,590 --> 00:43:18,170
He's afraid!

496
00:43:23,010 --> 00:43:25,810
Hold it!

497
00:43:26,890 --> 00:43:30,810
I said last night
I'd take your place!

498
00:43:30,810 --> 00:43:31,810
I should do this.

499
00:43:31,810 --> 00:43:34,190
You're no match for him.
Go over there and watch

500
00:43:37,820 --> 00:43:42,240
I'm sorry I'm late, Squire Koda.
I will be your opponent.

501
00:43:43,410 --> 00:43:45,830
What's that stick?

502
00:43:46,080 --> 00:43:50,160
My school of swordfighting
uses this for practice.

503
00:43:50,910 --> 00:43:54,920
Do you mock me?
Draw your sword!

504
00:43:55,170 --> 00:43:59,710
A sword might kill.
This stick will not.

505
00:44:00,010 --> 00:44:02,970
It will break bones at worst.

506
00:44:04,300 --> 00:44:09,970
I won't take this from a samurai
of your rank! I'll cut you down!

507
00:44:37,040 --> 00:44:39,550
Watch for the draw-and-slash!

508
00:44:44,470 --> 00:44:48,430
You can still apologize.

509
00:44:48,680 --> 00:44:50,810
The apology is yours to make.

510
00:45:36,940 --> 00:45:40,060
With a real sword, you'd be dead.

511
00:45:54,460 --> 00:45:56,460
Do you apologize?

512
00:45:57,880 --> 00:46:01,290
Or do you continue?

513
00:46:25,190 --> 00:46:28,740
Splash some water on him.
That'll bring him to.

514
00:46:29,030 --> 00:46:31,570
Come on, Iinuma.

515
00:46:37,000 --> 00:46:39,040
You're all right?

516
00:46:40,630 --> 00:46:44,090
Don't tell Miss Tomoe
about this.

517
00:46:44,130 --> 00:46:47,470
Or anyone else, either.

518
00:46:47,670 --> 00:46:50,010
Those men will talk.

519
00:46:51,260 --> 00:46:54,180
No. A whipped dog
doesn't bark.

520
00:47:19,790 --> 00:47:21,830
Is that soy sauce? Over here.

521
00:47:54,660 --> 00:47:59,910
Excuse me for interrupting. I am
Zenemon Yogo, Master of the Watch.

522
00:48:00,160 --> 00:48:01,370
I know that.

523
00:48:02,080 --> 00:48:07,090
Are you the "Twilight Seibei"
who thrashed Toyotaro Koda...

524
00:48:07,590 --> 00:48:12,430
...and left him with
a great big lump on his head?

525
00:48:12,680 --> 00:48:18,760
I didn't really "thrash" him.

526
00:48:19,060 --> 00:48:22,520
He asked for a match, and my
sword caught him on the head.

527
00:48:23,600 --> 00:48:26,770
Koda is a drinking companion
of mine.

528
00:48:27,110 --> 00:48:31,030
The other day...

529
00:48:31,490 --> 00:48:38,200
...he came crying to me, asking
if I would take revenge for him.

530
00:48:42,250 --> 00:48:46,040
That's the kind of man he is.

531
00:48:46,290 --> 00:48:52,300
But it seems you can fight.
What school are you?

532
00:48:52,760 --> 00:48:57,890
Many years ago I trained
under Toda-Sensei.

533
00:48:59,470 --> 00:49:02,270
So you're a disciple
of Jinsai Toda?

534
00:49:04,020 --> 00:49:08,650
I merely attended his dojo.

535
00:49:09,110 --> 00:49:12,860
Perhaps we could
try a match one day.

536
00:49:13,110 --> 00:49:20,830
I'd be no match for you
I'm afraid. If you'll excuse me...

537
00:49:33,670 --> 00:49:37,800
I wish I wasn't getting old.
I can't read once the sun sets.

538
00:49:38,140 --> 00:49:44,140
First your teeth go,
then it's your eyes.

539
00:49:44,430 --> 00:49:47,190
And how's number three?

540
00:49:47,230 --> 00:49:49,940
That went long ago!

541
00:49:53,190 --> 00:49:57,200
That's it for today, everyone.

542
00:50:12,500 --> 00:50:15,010
I'll be going.

543
00:50:18,010 --> 00:50:19,340
Excuse me.

544
00:50:24,640 --> 00:50:27,640
Sir Twilight's gone?

545
00:50:27,940 --> 00:50:30,520
Didn't you hear?

546
00:50:32,360 --> 00:50:37,490
The other day "Sir Twilight" fought
the son of Captain Koda.

547
00:50:37,700 --> 00:50:40,740
A fight? And what happened?

548
00:50:41,070 --> 00:50:44,240
Wood against steel.

549
00:50:44,290 --> 00:50:47,290
Sir Twilight went bang!
Knocked him senseless.

550
00:50:47,330 --> 00:50:48,580
He did?

551
00:50:48,960 --> 00:50:51,580
I always thought he was strange.

552
00:50:51,840 --> 00:50:55,670
I never thought
he was a fighter, though.

553
00:50:56,010 --> 00:50:59,970
Maybe we shouldn't
be calling him "Sir Twilight".

554
00:51:00,300 --> 00:51:01,970
You think he knows?

555
00:51:02,260 --> 00:51:04,510
Sure he does.

556
00:51:19,610 --> 00:51:21,990
Fumi! It's raining!

557
00:51:30,460 --> 00:51:33,330
It's raining!
Is the laundry in?

558
00:51:33,380 --> 00:51:34,460
Yes!

559
00:51:43,850 --> 00:51:46,010
Welcome home.

560
00:51:46,260 --> 00:51:50,270
Miss Tomoe was here.
She left you this letter.

561
00:51:53,440 --> 00:51:57,610
She's got even nicer writing
than the schoolmaster.

562
00:52:00,320 --> 00:52:01,280
Let me!

563
00:52:01,530 --> 00:52:03,070
No!

564
00:52:04,830 --> 00:52:10,750
I have finally learned what happened
from my elder brother.

565
00:52:11,460 --> 00:52:16,540
I must apologize
for all the trouble...

566
00:52:16,840 --> 00:52:19,300
...I have caused you.

567
00:52:19,550 --> 00:52:23,880
I am, however, delighted.

568
00:52:26,430 --> 00:52:31,520
I very much want to see you
and thank you in person.

569
00:52:32,190 --> 00:52:38,770
Today I intruded upon you and
with your daughters...

570
00:52:39,070 --> 00:52:41,490
...cleaned your house
and did your laundry.

571
00:52:41,780 --> 00:52:45,410
Please do not scold your daughters
for allowing me in.

572
00:52:45,950 --> 00:52:54,290
I would like in the future
to be of what use I can.

573
00:52:54,330 --> 00:52:55,460
Written in haste,

574
00:52:55,710 --> 00:53:02,460
To: Seibei Iguchi, Esq.
From: Tomoe

575
00:53:09,390 --> 00:53:15,270
Tomoe started coming
every second day or so.

576
00:53:15,520 --> 00:53:20,520
The two of us looked forward
to coming home from school.

577
00:53:20,650 --> 00:53:21,650
We're back!

578
00:53:21,940 --> 00:53:24,400
Hello!

579
00:53:26,530 --> 00:53:30,780
You know what the teacher
did today? He farted out loud!

580
00:53:38,840 --> 00:53:43,760
She cleaned with us,
did laundry with us...

581
00:53:44,050 --> 00:53:47,680
...and taught us to cook.

582
00:53:51,510 --> 00:53:55,980
On rainy days we'd practice
calligraphy and sewing.

583
00:53:56,100 --> 00:53:59,610
And she'd tell us all kinds
of stories, the like of which...

584
00:53:59,770 --> 00:54:03,730
...we'd never heard before.

585
00:54:03,780 --> 00:54:05,490
Finished.

586
00:54:08,410 --> 00:54:11,660
Bring this line over.

587
00:54:11,870 --> 00:54:13,120
Finished!

588
00:54:13,500 --> 00:54:15,830
That's good, Ito!

589
00:54:16,670 --> 00:54:19,500
Hey! Stop it!

590
00:54:20,290 --> 00:54:24,170
Ito! Write on
your own paper, all right?

591
00:54:24,460 --> 00:54:25,460
No!

592
00:54:36,890 --> 00:54:41,940
Don't you look nice!

593
00:54:42,270 --> 00:54:46,240
How much fun it was to go off
to a festival in kimonos...

594
00:54:46,650 --> 00:54:48,650
...she had made us.

595
00:55:06,460 --> 00:55:09,590
Shoo! Go away!

596
00:56:04,560 --> 00:56:08,940
Samurai then were strictly
forbidden to attend the festivals...

597
00:56:09,320 --> 00:56:13,950
...of the peasants
and townsfolk...

598
00:56:14,200 --> 00:56:17,990
...but Tomoe cared not a whit.

599
00:56:18,580 --> 00:56:21,000
I remember well what
she said:

600
00:56:21,290 --> 00:56:28,670
"It was because of the peasants
that we lived as samurai."

601
00:57:01,080 --> 00:57:05,210
Why are you catching them all?
We're using the same bait!

602
00:57:05,500 --> 00:57:11,550
You're trying too hard.
The fish sense it.

603
00:57:11,800 --> 00:57:16,390
Your shoulders are too stiff.
It's like swordfighting.

604
00:57:16,680 --> 00:57:18,930
Aw, stop lecturing!

605
00:57:19,600 --> 00:57:21,680
Show me your rod.

606
00:57:25,900 --> 00:57:29,150
This hook's too big!

607
00:57:34,570 --> 00:57:35,650
Seibei...

608
00:57:36,910 --> 00:57:39,200
...I want to talk to you.

609
00:57:40,490 --> 00:57:44,410
It's about Tomoe.

610
00:57:44,660 --> 00:57:48,630
She's had a few proposals.

611
00:57:49,710 --> 00:57:56,680
She's beautiful and talented.
There's not many like her in our clan.

612
00:57:57,590 --> 00:57:59,720
Any good ones?

613
00:58:00,010 --> 00:58:03,930
She won't say yes
and I can't pressure her.

614
00:58:04,180 --> 00:58:09,100
I asked her, half in jest
if she'd like to marry you.

615
00:58:09,400 --> 00:58:10,730
You what?!

616
00:58:11,770 --> 00:58:16,570
We may be old friends,
but that isn't funny!

617
00:58:16,820 --> 00:58:19,620
She didn't take it as a joke.

618
00:58:20,870 --> 00:58:24,750
She said she wouldn't mind...

619
00:58:25,000 --> 00:58:27,580
...and turned all red.

620
00:58:32,210 --> 00:58:37,840
That's enough!
You're both making fun of me!

621
00:58:39,890 --> 00:58:42,470
You dolt!

622
00:58:43,060 --> 00:58:45,020
She was serious.

623
00:58:45,230 --> 00:58:46,480
Stop it.

624
00:58:50,690 --> 00:58:52,860
Listen...

625
00:58:53,690 --> 00:59:00,570
...I've already put her through hell
marrying her to Koda.

626
00:59:02,780 --> 00:59:08,790
If it's all right with you,
I'd like to make that up to her.

627
00:59:09,920 --> 00:59:15,250
It's a bit sudden...

628
00:59:20,760 --> 00:59:26,140
I don't need an answer now,
but I will within two or three days.

629
00:59:27,850 --> 00:59:31,480
I might have to go to Edo.

630
00:59:31,940 --> 00:59:34,860
You've been really busy lately.
What's going on?

631
00:59:35,280 --> 00:59:37,860
You probably haven't heard.

632
00:59:39,320 --> 00:59:42,110
His Lordship's dead.

633
00:59:42,910 --> 00:59:48,500
A month ago.

634
00:59:48,910 --> 00:59:50,370
He is?

635
00:59:51,710 --> 00:59:55,210
Why have they kept that
from us?

636
00:59:55,420 --> 00:59:59,840
They're not agreed on
who's going to succeed him.

637
01:00:01,930 --> 01:00:07,260
The Castle Warden, Lord Hori
has asked the Shogun...

638
01:00:07,600 --> 01:00:13,310
...for permission to adopt
His Lordship's third boy, Tadaatsu...

639
01:00:13,650 --> 01:00:16,860
...and seize control himself.

640
01:00:17,110 --> 01:00:20,610
If that happens the clan will split
and blood will wash away blood.

641
01:00:20,950 --> 01:00:25,120
I might not come through this
unscathed myself.

642
01:00:26,780 --> 01:00:33,750
So if you could give me an answer
before I leave for Edo.

643
01:00:36,040 --> 01:00:37,670
All right.

644
01:00:39,760 --> 01:00:41,340
I'll answer you.

645
01:00:44,640 --> 01:00:50,060
I'm very grateful to Tomoe for
all she's done for my daughters...

646
01:00:51,600 --> 01:00:56,690
...all the cooking and sewing
and everything else.

647
01:00:56,940 --> 01:01:03,900
It's like a dream come true.

648
01:01:05,240 --> 01:01:06,910
However...

649
01:01:08,490 --> 01:01:14,830
...having her come to my house
as my wife is something else again.

650
01:01:18,710 --> 01:01:24,300
She's a daughter of the Iinumas,
a 400-koku family.

651
01:01:24,680 --> 01:01:30,010
She doesn't know what life is like
for a 50-koku petty samurai.

652
01:01:31,060 --> 01:01:35,560
Are you sure you're not
under-estimating her?

653
01:01:35,810 --> 01:01:38,900
She's very much her own woman.

654
01:01:39,190 --> 01:01:43,030
It'd be fine at the start,

655
01:01:43,320 --> 01:01:48,490
but when it sunk in that 50-koku
would be her life forever...

656
01:01:48,870 --> 01:01:53,410
...she'd be sorry.

657
01:01:54,750 --> 01:01:57,330
My late wife was.

658
01:02:00,040 --> 01:02:03,920
Hers was a 150-koku family.

659
01:02:03,970 --> 01:02:08,180
She never got used to
the fall in status.

660
01:02:09,140 --> 01:02:11,930
Rise in the world, she told me
or my family will grieve.

661
01:02:12,430 --> 01:02:17,020
She said that all the time
after she got sick.

662
01:02:17,980 --> 01:02:29,910
I don't want to put Tomoe
through that torment.

663
01:02:34,000 --> 01:02:37,960
Tomoe's not 15 or 16.

664
01:02:38,330 --> 01:02:43,500
I'm sure she'd thought about
what she said.

665
01:02:43,760 --> 01:02:44,960
No more.

666
01:02:47,130 --> 01:02:49,470
Let's forget this.

667
01:02:54,020 --> 01:02:55,680
Let's try up there.

668
01:02:58,730 --> 01:03:01,980
It's a girl!

669
01:03:08,200 --> 01:03:10,070
What a stink!

670
01:03:17,460 --> 01:03:20,670
Rise to Lord Buddha.

671
01:03:21,420 --> 01:03:25,670
Eat your fill in heaven!

672
01:03:26,010 --> 01:03:27,630
Let's call it a day.

673
01:03:35,970 --> 01:03:37,720
From that day forward
Miss Tomoe stopped coming...

674
01:03:37,980 --> 01:03:43,270
...to our house.

675
01:03:45,020 --> 01:03:47,320
Make way!

676
01:03:47,740 --> 01:03:49,150
Stand aside!

677
01:03:49,400 --> 01:03:51,150
Turning left!

678
01:04:01,170 --> 01:04:04,170
The Warden has returned!

679
01:04:24,650 --> 01:04:26,400
Go!

680
01:04:35,990 --> 01:04:37,870
What's that?!

681
01:04:38,120 --> 01:04:40,870
It's the alarm!

682
01:04:48,300 --> 01:04:51,130
Stop what you're doing and listen.

683
01:04:51,920 --> 01:04:56,180
I have important news
from Lord Hori, Castle Warden...

684
01:04:56,220 --> 01:04:58,760
...who returned
this morning from Edo.

685
01:04:59,600 --> 01:05:05,980
The 12th head of the Unasaka Clan
Lord Tadatomo, died of measles...

686
01:05:06,060 --> 01:05:08,190
...at the beginning of this month.

687
01:05:08,520 --> 01:05:11,030
He was 32 years old.

688
01:05:14,200 --> 01:05:19,530
He was a good and wise ruler
intelligent and tolerant...

689
01:05:19,870 --> 01:05:22,290
...a true hero.

690
01:05:23,290 --> 01:05:27,080
Only last spring we had
the honor of meeting him...

691
01:05:27,380 --> 01:05:32,170
...and having him speak to us.

692
01:05:32,300 --> 01:05:36,550
Iguchi, you haven't
forgotten that, I'm sure.

693
01:05:39,100 --> 01:05:43,140
What a fine and gentle man
he was!

694
01:05:46,150 --> 01:05:49,360
Senior retainers will
remain in the castle.

695
01:05:49,820 --> 01:05:55,700
The rest of you are to leave and pray
for the repose of His Lordship's soul.

696
01:06:08,670 --> 01:06:10,960
This could mean open war!

697
01:06:11,500 --> 01:06:17,510
I doubt that...

698
01:06:17,760 --> 01:06:20,470
...but Lord Hori's sure to go after
His Lordships reformers

699
01:06:21,180 --> 01:06:22,640
Dispositions?

700
01:06:22,850 --> 01:06:24,140
Yes.

701
01:06:24,520 --> 01:06:27,310
Which side is
our Commissioner on?

702
01:06:27,600 --> 01:06:30,480
The reformers
or the Hori faction?

703
01:06:30,940 --> 01:06:35,400
He'll be with the mainstream.

704
01:06:35,700 --> 01:06:39,110
Just like me.

705
01:06:42,790 --> 01:06:48,790
While there were fearsome rumors
that the Castle was preparing for war,...

706
01:06:49,210 --> 01:06:53,500
...it didn't seem to involve
a petty samurai like my father.

707
01:07:29,460 --> 01:07:31,040
All right?

708
01:07:32,710 --> 01:07:41,180
We wanted to ask Father
why Miss Tomoe no longer came...

709
01:07:41,640 --> 01:07:45,260
...but for some reason,
we couldn't.

710
01:07:46,220 --> 01:07:50,480
This was because even in
our children's hearts...

711
01:07:51,150 --> 01:07:55,190
...we knew something
had happened between them.

712
01:07:59,150 --> 01:08:02,820
Squire Iguchi!

713
01:08:04,910 --> 01:08:10,250
I'm sorry you've come for nothing.
My husband isn't back from Edo.

714
01:08:10,500 --> 01:08:14,380
I expect him in a day or two.

715
01:08:16,210 --> 01:08:21,010
Has he written anything about
what's happening in Edo?

716
01:08:21,340 --> 01:08:22,550
No.

717
01:08:22,800 --> 01:08:27,430
There was a letter yesterday,...

718
01:08:27,680 --> 01:08:32,390
...but all he talked about was what
he wants to eat when he gets home.

719
01:08:32,650 --> 01:08:34,230
That's good.

720
01:08:35,360 --> 01:08:41,110
I'm sure you know
they're handing down dispositions.

721
01:08:41,450 --> 01:08:45,280
Some people have even been
ordered to commit suicide.

722
01:08:45,490 --> 01:08:51,160
I was worried about what
might have happened to Iinuma.

723
01:08:51,460 --> 01:08:55,630
I'm happy to hear he's all right.

724
01:08:56,130 --> 01:08:59,750
Give him my regards
when he gets home.

725
01:09:00,170 --> 01:09:03,420
You came just for that?

726
01:09:03,470 --> 01:09:04,720
Yes.

727
01:09:05,050 --> 01:09:07,470
Good day.

728
01:09:11,270 --> 01:09:13,850
It was very kind of you.

729
01:09:23,450 --> 01:09:25,030
Carry on.

730
01:09:27,280 --> 01:09:28,830
Where's Squire Iguchi?

731
01:09:29,080 --> 01:09:32,120
He went away.

732
01:09:33,460 --> 01:09:35,420
Where are you going?

733
01:09:35,620 --> 01:09:39,040
Squire Iguchi may still be
close by.

734
01:09:39,250 --> 01:09:41,630
Why do you want to see him?

735
01:09:42,380 --> 01:09:46,180
No reason in particular.

736
01:09:46,430 --> 01:09:49,680
I haven't seen him for a while.
I'd like to say hello.

737
01:09:49,890 --> 01:09:51,100
Wait!

738
01:09:57,860 --> 01:09:59,730
Tomoe...

739
01:09:59,980 --> 01:10:03,280
...it is unseemly for
a young woman to be seen talking...

740
01:10:03,320 --> 01:10:06,910
...with some samurai on the street.

741
01:10:07,280 --> 01:10:10,580
And you are a returned bride
with a proposal being discussed.

742
01:10:10,910 --> 01:10:19,210
You shouldn't be doing that
in broad daylight with people around.

743
01:10:19,500 --> 01:10:24,420
I've been meaning to tell you that
for a long time now.

744
01:10:25,550 --> 01:10:31,180
What's wrong with a girl
talking to a samurai?

745
01:10:32,470 --> 01:10:35,560
Are you questioning
your elder brother's wife?

746
01:10:35,600 --> 01:10:37,560
Shouldn't I?

747
01:10:37,690 --> 01:10:39,350
You should not.

748
01:10:40,190 --> 01:10:45,070
A young women
does not question her elders.

749
01:11:05,630 --> 01:11:10,510
With 60 from last month
that comes to 550 mon.

750
01:11:11,760 --> 01:11:14,010
Could I have a receipt?

751
01:11:18,640 --> 01:11:24,400
You know the bath fee went up
to seven mon last month.

752
01:11:24,440 --> 01:11:29,200
Prices are going up everywhere.

753
01:11:29,490 --> 01:11:32,530
Could you pay more
for these cages?

754
01:11:33,200 --> 01:11:34,700
With things as unsettled
as they are...

755
01:11:34,990 --> 01:11:39,330
...no one's buying insect cages.

756
01:11:39,620 --> 01:11:44,210
Could you ask your boss
for me?

757
01:11:44,460 --> 01:11:47,340
Well, I'll ask.

758
01:11:47,630 --> 01:11:50,090
I take this work
as seriously as my duties.

759
01:11:50,300 --> 01:11:52,220
I understand that.

760
01:11:52,430 --> 01:11:54,760
If you'll excuse me.

761
01:11:57,810 --> 01:11:59,560
Come on.

762
01:12:19,330 --> 01:12:21,660
We're not thieves.

763
01:12:21,870 --> 01:12:27,630
We're just picking up some
insect cages from Squire Iguchi.

764
01:12:28,380 --> 01:12:32,050
Is he doing piece-work?

765
01:12:45,150 --> 01:12:48,480
Hello!

766
01:12:48,570 --> 01:12:52,400
Who is it?

767
01:12:52,700 --> 01:12:55,490
Commissioner Kusaka.

768
01:13:02,410 --> 01:13:04,830
It's very late, I know.

769
01:13:05,080 --> 01:13:09,590
I'd like you to accompany me
to Lord Hori's quarters.

770
01:13:09,630 --> 01:13:12,510
Yes, sir.

771
01:13:14,640 --> 01:13:18,300
They said you don't need
full formal dress.

772
01:13:18,560 --> 01:13:20,720
Just a hakama skirt.

773
01:13:36,530 --> 01:13:40,910
So you're Iguchi's girl?
How old are you?

774
01:13:41,580 --> 01:13:43,000
Five.

775
01:13:44,790 --> 01:13:47,250
You're a sweetheart.

776
01:13:51,840 --> 01:13:53,840
I'm ready.

777
01:14:03,020 --> 01:14:06,560
Kayano...you all get to bed.

778
01:14:11,610 --> 01:14:13,190
Let's sleep.

779
01:14:33,210 --> 01:14:35,670
Seibei Iguchi
of the Castle Stores...

780
01:14:35,720 --> 01:14:37,590
That'll do.

781
01:14:38,260 --> 01:14:41,800
Iguchi, come over here.

782
01:14:53,280 --> 01:14:58,990
We called you here this late,
because an awkward situation has arisen.

783
01:14:59,820 --> 01:15:03,910
You know there was a revolt
among our retainers in Edo?

784
01:15:04,830 --> 01:15:05,790
Yes, sir.

785
01:15:07,410 --> 01:15:11,210
Fortunately no word of this
reached the Shogun.

786
01:15:11,540 --> 01:15:16,050
His Lordship ordered Shima Hasegawa
and his faction to commit suicide.

787
01:15:16,300 --> 01:15:21,220
But one of Lord Hasegawa's men
Zenemon Yogo, Master of the Watch...

788
01:15:21,510 --> 01:15:28,850
...says he was merely following
the orders of his superior...

789
01:15:29,060 --> 01:15:31,770
...asks why he should be punished
and refuses to commit suicide.

790
01:15:32,190 --> 01:15:40,570
"If you want me dead
come and kill me!", he says!

791
01:15:40,860 --> 01:15:46,490
And with these disgraceful words
has barricaded himself in his house.

792
01:15:47,660 --> 01:15:53,670
This evening we sent our Master
of Foot, Genba Hattori, against him.

793
01:15:53,710 --> 01:15:57,880
Zenemon Yogo! I come
at the order of the clan!

794
01:16:01,970 --> 01:16:05,430
But he died himself.

795
01:16:15,440 --> 01:16:19,190
He's a "one-sword" fighter.

796
01:16:19,440 --> 01:16:22,820
No one in the clan
is his match.

797
01:16:23,570 --> 01:16:26,780
We were talking about who
to send against him...

798
01:16:27,120 --> 01:16:31,290
...and your name came up.

799
01:16:32,290 --> 01:16:35,710
Iguchi, raise your head.

800
01:16:39,260 --> 01:16:43,010
You're a "short-sword" fighter
of the Toda school?

801
01:16:44,180 --> 01:16:46,600
It's been years
since Toda-Sensei taught me.

802
01:16:46,850 --> 01:16:52,180
I merely attended his dojo.

803
01:16:52,640 --> 01:16:56,310
We don't have time
for modesty.

804
01:16:56,570 --> 01:17:01,940
We've learned that you were
an instructor at his dojo.

805
01:17:02,150 --> 01:17:06,030
He must be beaten inside his house.
The short sword will help there.

806
01:17:06,330 --> 01:17:13,710
That is another reason
we have chosen you.

807
01:17:13,960 --> 01:17:19,590
Kill Zenemon Yogo
by twilight tomorrow.

808
01:17:20,340 --> 01:17:24,220
That is an order from
the clan's Senior Retainer.

809
01:17:29,770 --> 01:17:33,520
Kusaka...what's this man's stipend?

810
01:17:33,810 --> 01:17:35,350
50 koku.

811
01:17:35,600 --> 01:17:39,400
20 koku bespoken
for a net of 30.

812
01:17:39,780 --> 01:17:44,950
That must be hard, with two young
daughters and an aged mother.

813
01:17:45,410 --> 01:17:49,330
Bring us the head
of Zenemon Yogo...

814
01:17:49,490 --> 01:17:51,830
...and life will be easier.

815
01:17:51,910 --> 01:17:55,330
Do you accept?

816
01:17:58,210 --> 01:18:00,340
Answer him.

817
01:18:01,250 --> 01:18:04,380
This is an honor.

818
01:18:05,800 --> 01:18:07,430
You shut up!

819
01:18:07,890 --> 01:18:09,470
Well?

820
01:18:13,640 --> 01:18:16,390
By your leave...

821
01:18:22,030 --> 01:18:28,240
I am ashamed to say that
over many years of hardship...

822
01:18:28,530 --> 01:18:33,910
...with two daughters, a sick wife
and an aged mother...

823
01:18:33,950 --> 01:18:39,830
...I have lost the desire
to wield a sword.

824
01:18:43,260 --> 01:18:50,090
A serious fight,
the killing of a man...

825
01:18:50,140 --> 01:18:57,480
...requires animal ferocity and
calm disregard for one's own life.

826
01:18:57,520 --> 01:19:02,980
I have neither of those
within me now.

827
01:19:03,480 --> 01:19:09,990
Perhaps in a month...

828
01:19:10,320 --> 01:19:13,530
...alone with the beasts in the hills
I could get them back.

829
01:19:13,580 --> 01:19:21,920
But tomorrow, I am afraid
is completely impossible.

830
01:19:23,340 --> 01:19:28,800
I ask that you extend
the honor of this commission...

831
01:19:29,720 --> 01:19:32,720
...to another man.

832
01:19:35,270 --> 01:19:39,060
What complete
and utter nonsense!

833
01:19:39,900 --> 01:19:45,650
We are not here for foolishness
from a petty samurai!

834
01:19:46,110 --> 01:19:50,030
Your clan orders you
to kill Yogo.

835
01:19:50,610 --> 01:19:52,950
Do you understand that?!

836
01:19:53,330 --> 01:19:57,040
The Clan's orders are
His Lordship's orders.

837
01:19:57,250 --> 01:20:00,460
The very thought of refusal
is an offense!

838
01:20:01,080 --> 01:20:05,880
You are relieved of your post!
You are expelled from the clan!

839
01:20:06,130 --> 01:20:08,170
Please, Warden...

840
01:20:09,130 --> 01:20:14,430
What do you say, Iguchi?
Do you accept?

841
01:20:14,680 --> 01:20:15,930
Of course he does!

842
01:20:16,060 --> 01:20:18,220
Don't you?

843
01:20:19,600 --> 01:20:24,360
May I request
an evening or two...

844
01:20:24,650 --> 01:20:27,900
...in which to give my answer?

845
01:20:27,940 --> 01:20:29,320
You may not!!

846
01:20:30,490 --> 01:20:33,160
You will answer now!

847
01:21:03,020 --> 01:21:05,310
I obey.

848
01:21:08,020 --> 01:21:11,030
I accept the commission...

849
01:21:13,240 --> 01:21:16,780
...to kill Zenemon Yogo.

850
01:21:18,200 --> 01:21:20,200
Well said!

851
01:21:20,500 --> 01:21:24,120
An officer will call
at the hour of the snake.

852
01:21:24,120 --> 01:21:27,460
Have your preparations made.

853
01:21:28,630 --> 01:21:30,960
Withdraw.

854
01:21:54,490 --> 01:22:00,160
Iguchi...

855
01:22:00,240 --> 01:22:02,540
Don't worry. Who's Zenemon
Yogo anyway?

856
01:22:02,830 --> 01:22:05,710
You're sure to win.

857
01:22:05,960 --> 01:22:09,340
I have decided exactly that.

858
01:22:09,670 --> 01:22:10,710
Good.

859
01:22:10,920 --> 01:22:15,170
One should, however
always prepare for the worst.

860
01:22:16,510 --> 01:22:20,850
That's true. The worst
can always happen.

861
01:22:21,100 --> 01:22:26,020
In that event, Commissioner,
this will be farewell.

862
01:22:29,860 --> 01:22:33,900
Thank you for everything
you've done for me.

863
01:22:35,360 --> 01:22:41,160
Please convey my regards
to my colleagues in the stores.

864
01:22:42,080 --> 01:22:43,660
I understand. And, uh...

865
01:22:44,000 --> 01:22:50,130
...I'll take responsibility for
those you leave behind.

866
01:22:50,420 --> 01:22:55,840
I'll see they are looked after.

867
01:22:57,550 --> 01:23:00,760
That's a relief to hear.

868
01:23:03,010 --> 01:23:06,520
All the best to you.

869
01:24:59,300 --> 01:25:05,430
A strange noise made me
open my eyes.

870
01:25:05,550 --> 01:25:12,020
Looking for the sound, I saw
my father sharpening his sword.

871
01:25:12,480 --> 01:25:18,520
He looked so strange it was hard
to believe he was my father.

872
01:25:21,240 --> 01:25:27,700
I still remember clearly
how he looked that night.

873
01:27:04,260 --> 01:27:07,930
The Heart Sutra:

874
01:27:11,220 --> 01:27:15,810
The bodhisative clearly saw
the emptiness of the five states...

875
01:27:15,850 --> 01:27:23,400
...thus relieving misfortune and pain.

876
01:27:23,440 --> 01:27:27,990
Form is only emptiness,
emptiness only form...

877
01:27:32,580 --> 01:27:34,370
We're going.

878
01:27:35,370 --> 01:27:36,660
Kayano!

879
01:27:41,330 --> 01:27:45,710
The Master said: a man cunning
of word and smiling of face...

880
01:27:45,960 --> 01:27:50,970
...is rarely benevolent.
Tseng Tzu said: Each day...

881
01:28:02,690 --> 01:28:05,400
Naota, do something for me.

882
01:28:05,440 --> 01:28:06,400
Yup.

883
01:28:06,990 --> 01:28:12,450
You know Miss Tomoe's house
in Nishikicho, don't you?

884
01:28:12,740 --> 01:28:14,030
Yup.

885
01:28:14,410 --> 01:28:18,290
Go there, and speak to
Miss Tomoe.

886
01:28:18,750 --> 01:28:21,580
Now, this is important.

887
01:28:21,790 --> 01:28:25,250
You have to see
Miss Tomoe herself.

888
01:28:25,380 --> 01:28:27,590
And then say...

889
01:28:28,510 --> 01:28:33,470
..."I'm really very sorry, but
could you come right away?

890
01:28:33,510 --> 01:28:37,850
"I'll explain why
when you get here."

891
01:28:38,390 --> 01:28:39,890
All right?

892
01:28:41,310 --> 01:28:43,730
I'm really very sorry...

893
01:28:45,860 --> 01:28:49,780
...but could you come
right away?

894
01:28:50,030 --> 01:28:51,110
I'll explain why...

895
01:28:51,450 --> 01:28:53,280
Uh, I'll explain why...

896
01:28:53,530 --> 01:28:56,450
I'll explain why
when you get here.

897
01:28:57,910 --> 01:29:01,120
When you get here.

898
01:29:01,330 --> 01:29:03,870
That's fine. Hurry!

899
01:29:15,600 --> 01:29:19,600
Look where she laid her egg!

900
01:29:22,890 --> 01:29:26,810
Could you come...

901
01:29:27,570 --> 01:29:31,440
I'll explain why
when you get here.

902
01:29:34,740 --> 01:29:37,660
Whatever's the matter
at this hour?

903
01:29:39,540 --> 01:29:43,460
I'm really very sorry...

904
01:29:43,710 --> 01:29:47,460
...but could you come
right away?

905
01:29:47,710 --> 01:29:52,840
When you get here...uh...

906
01:29:53,340 --> 01:29:55,380
He'll explain why?

907
01:29:55,680 --> 01:29:59,680
Squire Seibei sent you
to tell me that?

908
01:29:59,760 --> 01:30:02,890
All right. I'll get ready.

909
01:30:31,050 --> 01:30:34,840
I didn't think you'd come.

910
01:30:52,650 --> 01:30:57,570
The clan has ordered me
to go and fight...

911
01:30:57,910 --> 01:31:00,700
...another retainer.

912
01:31:03,290 --> 01:31:08,790
I'm going out under orders,
so I must be properly dressed...

913
01:31:09,040 --> 01:31:12,540
...and I can't do my hair alone.

914
01:31:12,920 --> 01:31:16,550
I'm in a bind,
so I asked you to come.

915
01:31:18,220 --> 01:31:23,560
If you can spare the time,
could you help me?

916
01:31:23,810 --> 01:31:26,600
When do you have to go?

917
01:31:26,930 --> 01:31:29,060
The hour of the snake.

918
01:31:29,310 --> 01:31:32,270
There's not much time.

919
01:31:33,270 --> 01:31:34,770
Where's your kimono?

920
01:31:34,820 --> 01:31:37,570
It's laid out over there.

921
01:31:40,990 --> 01:31:43,620
Naota, boil some water.

922
01:32:23,620 --> 01:32:25,830
Who's coming for you?

923
01:32:26,200 --> 01:32:28,290
A clan officer.

924
01:32:30,080 --> 01:32:34,830
Naota, will you wait
out by the gate?

925
01:32:37,090 --> 01:32:41,760
Sit down. I'll comb your hair.

926
01:33:00,740 --> 01:33:03,450
May I ask why...

927
01:33:06,120 --> 01:33:10,750
...you're going out to fight?

928
01:33:14,080 --> 01:33:16,960
I can't refuse a clan order.

929
01:33:19,300 --> 01:33:26,180
Petty I may be,
but I'm still a samurai.

930
01:33:47,120 --> 01:33:59,790
Bamboo baskets, hampers!

931
01:35:08,490 --> 01:35:14,990
Your elder brother...

932
01:35:15,250 --> 01:35:19,290
...asked if I would
take you as my wife.

933
01:35:20,290 --> 01:35:22,710
I refused.

934
01:35:23,840 --> 01:35:27,130
Did you know that?

935
01:35:29,010 --> 01:35:31,220
Yes, I did.

936
01:35:32,890 --> 01:35:34,470
But...

937
01:35:36,310 --> 01:35:39,020
But since that day...

938
01:35:39,940 --> 01:35:43,310
...when I told him no...

939
01:35:43,980 --> 01:35:49,030
...I've started thinking
about you.

940
01:35:55,580 --> 01:36:00,710
Now I think of it
ever since we were small...

941
01:36:03,210 --> 01:36:06,000
...and I made dolls
to give you...

942
01:36:07,880 --> 01:36:15,010
...I always dreamed one day
you'd come to me as my wife.

943
01:36:16,720 --> 01:36:24,190
That dream stayed with me
even after I got married...

944
01:36:24,480 --> 01:36:29,070
...and you married Koda.

945
01:36:29,530 --> 01:36:34,950
It's never faded.

946
01:36:39,870 --> 01:36:44,420
I'm going out now
to fight to the death.

947
01:36:46,420 --> 01:36:51,720
I'm going to win
and return to this house.

948
01:36:51,970 --> 01:36:57,720
At that time, if I were
to ask you...

949
01:36:58,020 --> 01:37:01,390
...to be my wife...

950
01:37:03,100 --> 01:37:06,110
...would you accept?

951
01:37:12,860 --> 01:37:18,450
A few days ago I had
a proposal...

952
01:37:18,700 --> 01:37:21,160
...from a retainer in Aizu.

953
01:37:21,410 --> 01:37:26,210
I accepted.

954
01:37:38,220 --> 01:37:40,850
I've been very rude.

955
01:37:43,190 --> 01:37:49,070
I should never have asked you
to come here.

956
01:37:50,320 --> 01:37:52,070
No.

957
01:37:52,700 --> 01:37:57,870
I'm happy that you asked me.

958
01:38:08,290 --> 01:38:11,840
I've been a fool.

959
01:38:13,970 --> 01:38:20,050
Please forget everything
I've said.

960
01:38:23,730 --> 01:38:29,440
Really? A retainer from Aizu...

961
01:38:30,650 --> 01:38:35,700
That sounds like.

962
01:38:45,120 --> 01:38:46,250
Are they here?

963
01:38:46,460 --> 01:38:47,540
Yup.

964
01:38:49,750 --> 01:38:53,090
Well, I'll be going.

965
01:38:56,430 --> 01:39:01,010
Thank you very much
for everything.

966
01:39:03,020 --> 01:39:04,770
Um...

967
01:39:06,140 --> 01:39:13,230
...I'm afraid I can't wait here
until you come back.

968
01:39:13,320 --> 01:39:19,360
I pray with all my heart...

969
01:39:22,160 --> 01:39:30,250
...that luck is with you
and you come back safely.

970
01:39:46,850 --> 01:39:51,940
Naota, see Miss Tomoe home
when she goes.

971
01:39:52,650 --> 01:39:55,190
Take care of the kids.

972
01:40:56,170 --> 01:40:58,210
Mrs Iguchi...

973
01:40:59,380 --> 01:41:02,180
...how are you today?

974
01:41:03,300 --> 01:41:06,010
Fine, thank you.

975
01:41:08,220 --> 01:41:13,310
Of which household
would you be the daughter?

976
01:41:15,060 --> 01:41:18,440
Me?

977
01:41:19,070 --> 01:41:21,400
I am...

978
01:41:22,570 --> 01:41:27,200
...Squire Seibei's
childhood friend...

979
01:41:29,120 --> 01:41:31,450
...Tomoe.

980
01:41:46,390 --> 01:41:47,680
Sir...

981
01:41:55,810 --> 01:41:58,150
Squire Iguchi?

982
01:42:01,440 --> 01:42:07,370
Zenemon Yogo has closed himself in
with the shutters down.

983
01:42:10,330 --> 01:42:13,660
That is Genba Hattori,
Master of Foot.

984
01:42:14,620 --> 01:42:17,330
We should remove
his corpse...

985
01:42:17,580 --> 01:42:21,090
...but no one can get in.

986
01:42:22,760 --> 01:42:25,050
Take care.

987
01:42:26,220 --> 01:42:30,810
Zenemon Yogo is no longer human.
He is a beast!

988
01:42:46,280 --> 01:42:47,660
Leave to enter!

989
01:43:23,030 --> 01:43:25,360
Sir Twilight...

990
01:43:39,370 --> 01:43:41,540
So they sent you?

991
01:43:46,300 --> 01:43:52,800
Zenemon Yogo...by order of
the clan, I come for your life.

992
01:43:55,310 --> 01:43:57,270
Draw your sword, please.

993
01:44:13,080 --> 01:44:15,160
Have a drink?

994
01:44:17,620 --> 01:44:22,290
I know you're all keyed up,
but I'm going to run.

995
01:44:22,630 --> 01:44:23,830
Run?

996
01:44:24,090 --> 01:44:25,340
Yep.

997
01:44:26,840 --> 01:44:32,340
I want you let me get away.
If you please.

998
01:44:39,310 --> 01:44:44,690
I didn't expect that from the clan's
best one-sword man.

999
01:44:45,770 --> 01:44:50,820
My orders are to kill you.
I can't let you escape.

1000
01:44:53,620 --> 01:44:59,080
Don't be so impatient.
You can kill me any time.

1001
01:44:59,370 --> 01:45:02,540
I'd like to talk to you.

1002
01:45:03,250 --> 01:45:05,750
Have a seat.

1003
01:45:11,510 --> 01:45:13,970
It's a nice day.

1004
01:45:16,180 --> 01:45:17,970
Sit down.

1005
01:45:36,070 --> 01:45:37,660
What's going on?

1006
01:45:37,870 --> 01:45:39,700
They're talking.

1007
01:45:47,460 --> 01:45:52,090
Even if you escaped
where would you go?

1008
01:45:52,880 --> 01:45:58,430
Over that mountain and I'm out
of the clan's domain.

1009
01:45:58,680 --> 01:46:01,640
There are masterless samurai
everywhere.

1010
01:46:01,930 --> 01:46:06,310
I can lose myself in them,
go to Kyoto, to Edo...

1011
01:46:06,560 --> 01:46:08,400
If I do that for a few years...

1012
01:46:08,730 --> 01:46:12,570
...the world will have changed.

1013
01:46:13,150 --> 01:46:15,740
The samurai's day is done.

1014
01:46:16,030 --> 01:46:18,910
This isn't the time
for that talk.

1015
01:46:19,490 --> 01:46:23,910
Pick up your sword, please.

1016
01:46:25,210 --> 01:46:28,420
I am under orders
from the clan to...

1017
01:46:28,500 --> 01:46:31,420
Like hell!

1018
01:46:33,800 --> 01:46:40,850
You're the clan's errand boy
out to claim a reward.

1019
01:46:41,770 --> 01:46:48,440
Have a drink.
I was an errand boy, too.

1020
01:47:01,280 --> 01:47:05,580
I served Lord Shigemasa Toki.

1021
01:47:05,660 --> 01:47:11,420
Twelve years ago he was ordered
to commit suicide...

1022
01:47:11,500 --> 01:47:15,420
...after a power struggle
within his clan.

1023
01:47:15,880 --> 01:47:19,050
Then I wandered for seven years
with my wife and daughter...

1024
01:47:19,340 --> 01:47:25,470
...in search of a new situation.

1025
01:47:25,980 --> 01:47:27,600
Seven?

1026
01:47:28,650 --> 01:47:32,060
With no income?

1027
01:47:32,110 --> 01:47:33,820
Of course not.

1028
01:47:34,070 --> 01:47:39,820
I did manual labor and helped
peasants plant and harvest...

1029
01:47:40,700 --> 01:47:43,080
...to get a little rice.

1030
01:47:43,370 --> 01:47:48,620
Or we'd slink into a temple
and beg alms there sometimes.

1031
01:47:49,670 --> 01:47:55,050
Three years ago the Unasaka clan
made me an official retainer...

1032
01:47:55,340 --> 01:48:00,680
...but by then hardship
had killed my wife.

1033
01:48:02,760 --> 01:48:07,930
I'm good with a sword,
but I'm hard to get along with...

1034
01:48:09,390 --> 01:48:15,860
...and I can't hold my liquor.

1035
01:48:16,190 --> 01:48:19,450
But this time I promised myself
it'd be different.

1036
01:48:19,740 --> 01:48:22,620
I would do my duty
as a true Unasaka retainer.

1037
01:48:22,700 --> 01:48:28,370
I worked hard to do that.

1038
01:48:28,660 --> 01:48:32,960
My superior was
Lord Shima Hasegawa.

1039
01:48:33,250 --> 01:48:38,010
He liked me, and did
all he could for me.

1040
01:48:38,630 --> 01:48:40,260
To me...

1041
01:48:41,180 --> 01:48:46,560
...the tasks he assigned were
the tasks of the clan.

1042
01:48:46,930 --> 01:48:53,690
His orders were the clan's orders
and I carried them out faithfully.

1043
01:48:53,900 --> 01:48:56,230
What was wrong with that,
Twilight?

1044
01:48:56,480 --> 01:49:01,950
Why do I have to
cut open my stomach?

1045
01:49:03,410 --> 01:49:05,660
I haven't come here
to answer...

1046
01:49:05,700 --> 01:49:11,080
...that kind of question.

1047
01:49:15,790 --> 01:49:22,970
I heard your wife died
of consumption. Is that true?

1048
01:49:23,930 --> 01:49:25,720
I'm surprised you know that.

1049
01:49:25,760 --> 01:49:30,390
And her fever went up
as night came on?

1050
01:49:30,600 --> 01:49:32,310
Yes.

1051
01:49:33,810 --> 01:49:39,780
Consumption is a hard disease.
And it's catching.

1052
01:49:40,070 --> 01:49:45,740
My daughter died of consumption
caught from her mother.

1053
01:49:46,280 --> 01:49:50,370
You're not the only one
who's suffered.

1054
01:49:50,660 --> 01:49:53,620
How old was your daughter?

1055
01:49:54,710 --> 01:49:56,500
Sixteen.

1056
01:50:02,170 --> 01:50:06,800
When she should have been
a bud swelling into bloom...

1057
01:50:07,050 --> 01:50:09,930
...she died...

1058
01:50:12,520 --> 01:50:18,940
...nothing but skin and bones.
A sad, sad sight.

1059
01:50:19,320 --> 01:50:22,690
I'm very sorry to hear that.

1060
01:50:22,780 --> 01:50:25,570
Her ashes.

1061
01:50:29,740 --> 01:50:34,660
She was a pretty girl
with pale skin.

1062
01:50:44,880 --> 01:50:49,800
I guess Lord Hasegawa
took pity on me.

1063
01:50:49,890 --> 01:50:56,770
He gave me money for a funeral
well above my station.

1064
01:50:56,850 --> 01:50:59,520
If only for that...

1065
01:50:59,770 --> 01:51:05,400
...I'm very much in
Lord Hasegawa's debt.

1066
01:51:09,370 --> 01:51:12,490
What's your stipend?

1067
01:51:14,450 --> 01:51:16,330
50 koku.

1068
01:51:18,460 --> 01:51:24,340
A sick wife, and children
all on 50 koku?

1069
01:51:24,760 --> 01:51:27,680
That must be hard.

1070
01:51:32,140 --> 01:51:38,020
Doctor and medicine alone cost
a ryo and 2 bu a month.

1071
01:51:42,150 --> 01:51:46,070
Piece work wouldn't cover that.

1072
01:51:46,320 --> 01:51:50,910
I borrowed from relatives
but it still wasn't enough.

1073
01:51:50,990 --> 01:51:56,500
Sometimes we didn't even have
tomorrow's rice left.

1074
01:51:56,750 --> 01:52:03,090
I know how bad it feels to see
the bottom of your rice chest.

1075
01:52:03,380 --> 01:52:06,510
You've had hard times, too.

1076
01:52:06,880 --> 01:52:10,930
Where I really ran into trouble
was at my wife's funeral.

1077
01:52:12,760 --> 01:52:18,140
The family's main branch wanted
a funeral that wouldn't shame them.

1078
01:52:18,440 --> 01:52:20,440
I couldn't afford it.

1079
01:52:21,480 --> 01:52:26,780
I was desperate
so I finally sold my sword.

1080
01:52:27,070 --> 01:52:31,410
It was a fine sword
I'd inherited from my father...

1081
01:52:34,990 --> 01:52:43,880
...but I figured
the age of the sword was over.

1082
01:52:45,710 --> 01:52:51,880
I'm afraid this is just bamboo.

1083
01:52:57,100 --> 01:53:01,640
You're going to kill me
with a bamboo sword?

1084
01:53:04,270 --> 01:53:06,230
No.

1085
01:53:06,820 --> 01:53:11,360
I learned short-sword
from Toda-Sensei

1086
01:53:11,700 --> 01:53:16,660
I meant to fight with that.

1087
01:53:16,870 --> 01:53:18,830
Short-sword?

1088
01:53:20,000 --> 01:53:24,710
You mean to kill me
with some kind of cheap trick?

1089
01:53:25,130 --> 01:53:29,550
You're not taking me seriously,
are you?

1090
01:53:29,960 --> 01:53:31,510
Wait!

1091
01:53:31,760 --> 01:53:33,470
I won't have it!

1092
01:53:33,930 --> 01:53:38,760
I only told you that because
you wanted me to let you go!

1093
01:53:43,020 --> 01:53:44,020
Draw!

1094
01:53:49,360 --> 01:53:51,110
Sir!

1095
01:54:14,430 --> 01:54:16,510
You're very good...

1096
01:54:18,890 --> 01:54:23,310
If you want to run,
now's your chance.

1097
01:54:24,940 --> 01:54:27,100
After I kill you.

1098
01:54:31,940 --> 01:54:33,610
Draw!

1099
01:54:35,410 --> 01:54:39,070
Sir! There's still time
to stop.

1100
01:54:49,840 --> 01:54:51,500
Calm down and think!

1101
01:54:52,340 --> 01:54:55,130
You haven't rested
since yesterday.

1102
01:54:55,970 --> 01:55:00,050
You're already breathing hard.

1103
01:55:00,640 --> 01:55:03,640
You mock me.

1104
01:55:11,940 --> 01:55:17,950
Sir! Continue this
and I'll cut you down.

1105
01:55:18,870 --> 01:55:20,950
Is that what you want?

1106
01:55:21,160 --> 01:55:22,870
That's fine by me.

1107
01:55:26,370 --> 01:55:27,790
Draw.

1108
01:55:58,110 --> 01:56:02,530
You've cut me, Twilight.

1109
01:57:10,560 --> 01:57:14,770
This is what you get
for taking me lightly.

1110
01:57:46,510 --> 01:57:49,350
Have a seat.

1111
01:58:05,110 --> 01:58:11,080
Will you let me go,
Twilight?

1112
01:58:13,210 --> 01:58:15,170
That was...

1113
01:58:17,130 --> 01:58:19,750
...my intention.

1114
01:58:40,900 --> 01:58:42,820
It's dark.

1115
01:58:50,200 --> 01:58:53,040
I can't see.

1116
01:58:59,380 --> 01:59:01,380
Hell.

1117
01:59:19,480 --> 01:59:21,230
Twilight...

1118
01:59:54,810 --> 01:59:56,390
Is it over?

1119
02:00:00,690 --> 02:00:05,070
It's all yours.

1120
02:00:08,450 --> 02:00:09,280
Careful!

1121
02:00:16,290 --> 02:00:17,620
He's dead!

1122
02:00:49,900 --> 02:00:50,990
Ito...

1123
02:00:53,870 --> 02:00:55,370
Go buy some tofu.

1124
02:00:59,250 --> 02:01:01,040
Don't lose the money.

1125
02:01:09,420 --> 02:01:10,800
Miss Kayano!

1126
02:01:11,050 --> 02:01:13,090
It's the Master!

1127
02:01:24,230 --> 02:01:25,360
Ito...

1128
02:01:27,690 --> 02:01:29,610
...I'm home.

1129
02:01:49,800 --> 02:01:53,840
Miss Tomoe! Father's back!

1130
02:02:28,500 --> 02:02:33,760
You're still here...

1131
02:02:40,010 --> 02:02:41,680
Thank heaven!

1132
02:02:43,770 --> 02:02:45,940
I was sure...

1133
02:02:46,400 --> 02:02:52,280
...you were dead!

1134
02:03:01,120 --> 02:03:06,500
Finally Miss Tomoe
became our mother.

1135
02:03:06,920 --> 02:03:09,380
My father was happy.

1136
02:03:13,710 --> 02:03:21,050
But peace prevailed in our house
for less than three years.

1137
02:03:22,970 --> 02:03:26,640
With the Meiji Restoration
came civil war.

1138
02:03:27,350 --> 02:03:30,810
Our clan supported
the former Shogun...

1139
02:03:31,150 --> 02:03:36,440
...and fought as rebels
against the emperor's government.

1140
02:03:38,360 --> 02:03:41,370
During this "Boshin War"...

1141
02:03:41,490 --> 02:03:45,660
...my father was shot
and killed

1142
02:04:09,310 --> 02:04:15,900
Tomoe took us, her step-daughters
to Edo, now "Tokyo"...

1143
02:04:16,400 --> 02:04:21,570
...and supported us
until we were both married.

1144
02:04:22,490 --> 02:04:29,830
Now she sleeps with my father
beneath this stone.

1145
02:04:31,460 --> 02:04:38,510
In the new Meiji era, many men
who had worked with my father...

1146
02:04:38,510 --> 02:04:43,680
...rose to positions
of great authority.

1147
02:04:43,720 --> 02:04:46,560
I often heard them say...

1148
02:04:46,770 --> 02:04:51,060
...that "Twilight Seibei
was an unlucky man."

1149
02:04:51,100 --> 02:04:57,440
But I do not agree.

1150
02:04:58,530 --> 02:05:04,200
My father had no desire
to rise in the world...

1151
02:05:04,240 --> 02:05:09,250
...and I don't think
he considered himself unlucky.

1152
02:05:10,710 --> 02:05:13,670
He loved his daughters...

1153
02:05:14,210 --> 02:05:18,590
...and the beautiful Tomoe
loved him.

1154
02:05:18,670 --> 02:05:25,430
His life, I think
was short but full.

1155
02:05:26,930 --> 02:05:33,690
I am proud to have had
such a father.
