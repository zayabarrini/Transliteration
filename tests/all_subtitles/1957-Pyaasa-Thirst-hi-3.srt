1
00:02:41,194 --> 00:02:43,662
''These smiling flowers''

2
00:02:46,199 --> 00:02:48,497
''These fragrant gardens''

3
00:02:51,304 --> 00:02:53,329
''This world filled...''

4
00:02:53,406 --> 00:02:58,935
''with glorious colours''

5
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:28,133
''The nectar intoxicates the bees''

6
00:03:30,343 --> 00:03:36,475
''The nectar intoxicates the bees''

7
00:03:44,190 --> 00:03:51,995
''What little have l to add
to this splendour...''

8
00:03:53,967 --> 00:04:01,772
''save a fear tears,
a few sighs''

9
00:04:02,976 --> 00:04:06,776
l told you to keep the place tidy.

10
00:04:07,647 --> 00:04:12,778
lf that manuscript was here,
then where has it got to ?

11
00:04:15,321 --> 00:04:18,950
- What do you know, then?
- He wished you good morning.

12
00:04:19,158 --> 00:04:21,956
Fool!
l mean about the manuscript!

13
00:04:22,996 --> 00:04:24,964
You've looked at my things?

14
00:04:26,833 --> 00:04:28,300
Wings?

15
00:04:29,168 --> 00:04:32,797
This is a newspaper office,
not a bird house!

16
00:04:33,006 --> 00:04:34,473
Wings, indeed!

17
00:04:34,674 --> 00:04:39,475
Things.
Have you read the poems l left?

18
00:04:40,013 --> 00:04:41,139
l have.

19
00:04:41,514 --> 00:04:44,483
Did you like them?
You'll publish them?

20
00:04:44,684 --> 00:04:47,312
l haven't lost my mind.

21
00:04:47,520 --> 00:04:51,820
Call that gibberish poetry? lt's
a crusade against unemployment.

22
00:04:52,692 --> 00:04:59,097
Poetry deals with delicacies:
You must write poems about love.

23
00:04:59,632 --> 00:05:01,600
You are incomparable, Sir!

24
00:05:02,135 --> 00:05:04,433
Write about intoxication...

25
00:05:04,971 --> 00:05:10,273
...the beauty of a cup,
or a fine woman.

26
00:05:10,476 --> 00:05:13,604
Shut up.
You don't write poetry.

27
00:05:13,980 --> 00:05:16,778
Have you read poets
like Mir and Momin?

28
00:05:17,650 --> 00:05:21,609
Yes, and Josh and Faiz, who are
beyond your comprehension.

29
00:05:22,155 --> 00:05:25,454
Give me my poems.
- We will find them later.

30
00:05:30,163 --> 00:05:36,796
What do you think
you're doing young man?

31
00:05:43,176 --> 00:05:47,806
What right have you
to throw away my poems?

32
00:05:48,014 --> 00:05:50,812
Should l make a paper hat of them?

33
00:05:51,017 --> 00:05:54,748
Don't insult them by
wearing them on a hollow head.

34
00:05:54,954 --> 00:05:56,922
My head? Hollow?

35
00:05:58,124 --> 00:06:02,254
How about yours? lf you're
a poet, l'm a donkey!

36
00:06:03,629 --> 00:06:06,757
lt's clear, and it's nice
to hear you admit it.

37
00:06:19,979 --> 00:06:23,278
Are you weighing
vegetables or gold?

38
00:06:27,320 --> 00:06:29,288
There's Uncle Vijay!

39
00:06:53,346 --> 00:06:55,246
l've caught him.

40
00:07:05,124 --> 00:07:10,084
l'm not your enemy.
Why run from your mother?

41
00:07:10,963 --> 00:07:17,266
Where have you been?
l can't bear to see your suffer.

42
00:07:18,137 --> 00:07:19,434
l'm well, mother.

43
00:07:19,639 --> 00:07:24,269
Sure you are. Just look
at the state you're in.

44
00:07:25,311 --> 00:07:32,774
Come home. l've hidden away
some good food for you.

45
00:07:33,319 --> 00:07:36,948
You've found him?
- Yes.

46
00:07:54,273 --> 00:07:57,242
Well, mother.
So your poet is home!

47
00:07:59,612 --> 00:08:02,581
Every literate fool thinks
he's poet.

48
00:08:05,017 --> 00:08:08,077
Where else can he get food
as a parasite?

49
00:08:08,287 --> 00:08:10,755
Take no notice of them. Eat.

50
00:08:15,995 --> 00:08:21,934
See? We earn and mother feeds
delicacies to her layabout.

51
00:08:22,301 --> 00:08:24,769
He's shameless.

52
00:08:25,471 --> 00:08:30,602
lf he had any self-respect, he'd
starve rather than eat here.

53
00:08:34,480 --> 00:08:39,941
Shut up, you two! l won't hear
a word said against him.

54
00:08:40,486 --> 00:08:45,617
He's back after so long, and
you can't bear to see him eat.

55
00:08:45,825 --> 00:08:50,455
He's hale and hearty. Why doesn't
he earn and not burden us?

56
00:08:50,997 --> 00:08:55,457
After his father died,
you should look after him.

57
00:08:56,002 --> 00:09:02,305
lt wasn't our wish that our
parents produce such a layabout.

58
00:09:07,179 --> 00:09:09,477
That l must have to hear this!

59
00:09:10,516 --> 00:09:13,815
lt was my misfortunate
to give birth to you two.

60
00:09:14,353 --> 00:09:17,811
You won't even let me work,
because of your ''prestige''.

61
00:09:20,293 --> 00:09:23,490
lf l could work as a maid,
l could feed my son.

62
00:09:27,867 --> 00:09:29,994
Sister-in-law,
Where are my poems?

63
00:09:30,536 --> 00:09:33,334
Address me, not the women.

64
00:09:33,773 --> 00:09:36,003
l sold them for
10 annas as waste paper.

65
00:09:44,050 --> 00:09:50,512
Waste paper?
You sold my poems for ten annas?

66
00:09:53,225 --> 00:09:55,284
Uncouth fools no better.

67
00:09:55,661 --> 00:10:03,124
You call me uncouth?
Did you hear that, brother?

68
00:10:03,336 --> 00:10:10,469
l got rid of them this morning.
Now l'll get rid of you! Out!

69
00:10:15,514 --> 00:10:20,645
Where will you go on an empty
stomach? Who will tend to you?

70
00:10:22,021 --> 00:10:23,648
You take me along with you.

71
00:10:23,856 --> 00:10:27,485
l don't want to stay here
for another minute.

72
00:10:28,694 --> 00:10:32,323
Don't worry, mother.
l'll do my best.

73
00:10:34,033 --> 00:10:38,333
l'll take you away from here
as soon as l can.

74
00:10:51,050 --> 00:10:55,612
Let me get on with my work
instead of searching waste paper.

75
00:10:56,155 --> 00:10:59,124
But there was an important file.

76
00:10:59,492 --> 00:11:01,790
A file?
Containing handwritten papers?

77
00:11:02,828 --> 00:11:06,457
Where are they?
- A woman bought them.

78
00:11:08,668 --> 00:11:13,970
They caught her eye, she read
some, then she took them away.

79
00:11:14,507 --> 00:11:16,475
Which woman?
Where does she live?

80
00:11:16,676 --> 00:11:19,645
l don't know;
she wasn't a local person.

81
00:11:28,354 --> 00:11:30,982
lf she comes again, l'll ask.

82
00:11:42,702 --> 00:11:44,329
Come come!

83
00:11:45,037 --> 00:11:47,005
Have you fallen out with your
brothers again?

84
00:11:50,042 --> 00:11:53,011
Are you hungry?
You'll starve to death.

85
00:11:53,479 --> 00:11:57,108
Well, today l got 20 rupees
from a rich man.

86
00:11:59,151 --> 00:12:03,110
His car was run over a woman's leg.
l gave false witness for him.

87
00:12:05,491 --> 00:12:09,450
Shyam, remember how you found
a lame sparrow as a kid?

88
00:12:11,997 --> 00:12:14,465
You cared for it
until it was better.

89
00:12:14,934 --> 00:12:16,902
l was only a kid.

90
00:12:19,672 --> 00:12:21,640
But you are a kid now also.

91
00:13:29,942 --> 00:13:33,810
''Lament not...''

92
00:13:35,014 --> 00:13:41,647
''if l turn my face away...''

93
00:13:43,956 --> 00:13:48,655
''your gaze is filled...''

94
00:13:48,794 --> 00:13:52,821
''with such longing''

95
00:13:57,803 --> 00:13:59,270
Listen.

96
00:14:04,643 --> 00:14:05,940
l was saying...

97
00:14:07,146 --> 00:14:10,274
''Who know what you said?''

98
00:14:11,317 --> 00:14:14,445
''Who knows what l heard?''

99
00:14:15,154 --> 00:14:18,123
''Something stirred in my heart''

100
00:14:19,558 --> 00:14:22,288
''Who knows what you said...?''

101
00:14:58,297 --> 00:15:05,100
''l felt my heart awaken,
l felt such elation''

102
00:15:13,979 --> 00:15:20,441
''Slumbering dreams reawakened,
something stirred in my heart''

103
00:15:21,487 --> 00:15:24,786
''Who knows what you said?''

104
00:15:25,658 --> 00:15:28,456
''Who knows what l heard''

105
00:15:29,662 --> 00:15:32,790
''Something stirred in my heart''

106
00:15:57,623 --> 00:16:04,426
''l stumble no more,
my feet no longer falter''

107
00:16:13,472 --> 00:16:19,604
''There is new life in my step.
Something stirred in my heart''

108
00:16:20,646 --> 00:16:23,774
''Who knows what you said''

109
00:16:24,817 --> 00:16:27,786
''Who knows what l heard''

110
00:16:28,654 --> 00:16:31,452
''But something sure
stirred in my heart''

111
00:17:04,456 --> 00:17:10,918
''The cascade of my hair
is filled with sweet fragrance''

112
00:17:19,304 --> 00:17:21,932
''Doors open to reveal secret longings;

113
00:17:22,808 --> 00:17:25,777
''something stirred in my heart''

114
00:17:27,079 --> 00:17:29,775
''Who knows what you said''

115
00:17:30,649 --> 00:17:33,447
''Who knows what l heard''

116
00:17:34,319 --> 00:17:36,947
''Something stirred in my heart''

117
00:18:03,282 --> 00:18:05,250
Excuse me...
- Yes?

118
00:18:07,453 --> 00:18:10,422
That song you were singing...
- You like it?

119
00:18:11,123 --> 00:18:13,091
Where did you get it?

120
00:18:14,626 --> 00:18:16,093
lt's mine.

121
00:18:17,463 --> 00:18:20,591
lt isn't yours.
- Then why ask, if you know?

122
00:18:20,799 --> 00:18:24,929
Because l <i>....</i>
- What do you want?

123
00:18:27,306 --> 00:18:29,604
The file with that song in it.

124
00:18:29,808 --> 00:18:31,776
ls that all?

125
00:18:32,644 --> 00:18:34,612
l don't like prattle.

126
00:18:36,982 --> 00:18:38,950
Do you like me?

127
00:18:40,486 --> 00:18:41,953
No.

128
00:18:42,488 --> 00:18:45,116
Then why follow me?

129
00:18:45,324 --> 00:18:47,792
l want to know only that the
file is with you or not.

130
00:18:47,993 --> 00:18:50,461
lt's valuable to me.
Whenever l have money...

131
00:18:50,996 --> 00:18:56,798
So you've followed
me empty-handed? Get out!

132
00:18:57,336 --> 00:18:59,964
Please understand.
l want only that file.

133
00:19:00,339 --> 00:19:01,636
For me it is important.

134
00:19:01,773 --> 00:19:05,641
You go, or should l
remove my sandal.

135
00:19:14,186 --> 00:19:17,815
Stop shouting, silly.
Your customer will run away.

136
00:19:18,023 --> 00:19:21,982
A pauper! l lured him here,
but he hasn't a penny.

137
00:19:45,717 --> 00:19:47,685
Juhi, it was him.

138
00:19:48,887 --> 00:19:52,345
Gulabo, where are you running?

139
00:19:53,058 --> 00:19:56,619
l must apologize to him,
l treated him very badly.

140
00:20:07,839 --> 00:20:13,141
Stop talking in riddles
and tell me in plain words.

141
00:20:14,012 --> 00:20:16,310
What's all this about?

142
00:20:18,016 --> 00:20:21,315
The man who followed me
is a poet.

143
00:20:22,688 --> 00:20:26,488
The poet whose poems l bought
as waste paper.

144
00:20:27,359 --> 00:20:30,487
Look: the same paper,
the same writing.

145
00:20:31,196 --> 00:20:33,994
And l threw him out as a pauper.

146
00:20:36,034 --> 00:20:42,837
He is a pauper.
You did quite the right thing.

147
00:20:43,542 --> 00:20:48,502
Foolish girl! Come on

148
00:22:06,158 --> 00:22:09,127
Have you written any poems
in the holidays?

149
00:22:09,494 --> 00:22:11,291
A few.

150
00:22:11,496 --> 00:22:17,298
Anyone can write poems. lf you're
a true poet, create something.

151
00:22:17,669 --> 00:22:19,637
Extempore?

152
00:22:25,577 --> 00:22:27,545
But on what subject?

153
00:22:31,516 --> 00:22:32,983
Who is she?

154
00:22:33,185 --> 00:22:37,986
There's your subject:
a poem about her.

155
00:22:42,027 --> 00:22:45,986
''When l walk,
even my shadow lags behind''

156
00:22:50,035 --> 00:22:53,937
''When you walk,
the universe keeps pace''

157
00:22:55,474 --> 00:22:59,274
''When l stop,
clouds of misery gather''

158
00:23:00,812 --> 00:23:04,441
''When you stop...
spring's radiance is outshone''

159
00:23:38,517 --> 00:23:39,984
Miss Pushlata.

160
00:25:25,490 --> 00:25:31,451
''Our love will survive every trial''

161
00:25:35,767 --> 00:25:41,467
''We shall never forget
our oath of love''

162
00:25:56,454 --> 00:26:02,586
''We leave the world
far behind''

163
00:26:03,295 --> 00:26:08,597
''How long will we
journey together?''

164
00:26:59,618 --> 00:27:00,585
Coolie!

165
00:27:09,294 --> 00:27:12,752
A coolie.
- At your service.

166
00:27:18,136 --> 00:27:19,262
Put these in the car.

167
00:27:24,142 --> 00:27:27,111
What has the world come to?

168
00:27:27,312 --> 00:27:29,439
The educated work as coolies.

169
00:27:31,650 --> 00:27:33,618
Have your money.

170
00:28:01,279 --> 00:28:04,248
No credit.

171
00:28:16,461 --> 00:28:18,429
lt's counterfeit.

172
00:28:28,139 --> 00:28:30,437
So you've got nothing else.

173
00:28:32,811 --> 00:28:35,780
So that's your game!

174
00:28:36,481 --> 00:28:38,779
Now who'll pay for that food
you've touched?

175
00:28:39,084 --> 00:28:41,780
Pay up, or l'll have your shirt.

176
00:28:42,320 --> 00:28:43,947
Take the plate away.

177
00:28:44,656 --> 00:28:46,624
Put it back!

178
00:28:49,327 --> 00:28:51,295
Keep the change.

179
00:28:51,996 --> 00:28:56,456
Go to a barber and get yourself
made to look more human.

180
00:29:04,843 --> 00:29:06,310
Do eat.

181
00:29:10,348 --> 00:29:13,977
l'm not hungry.
- Yes, you are.

182
00:29:14,686 --> 00:29:16,654
You've no right to take pity on me.

183
00:29:24,696 --> 00:29:26,323
l'm sorry...

184
00:29:28,533 --> 00:29:30,501
...take no notice of me.

185
00:29:31,369 --> 00:29:34,338
You have every right
to be angry.

186
00:29:35,373 --> 00:29:39,002
l treated you very badly
the other day.

187
00:29:41,045 --> 00:29:42,512
l've nothing against you.

188
00:29:44,215 --> 00:29:46,183
Then please eat...

189
00:29:47,719 --> 00:29:48,686
...for my sake.

190
00:29:51,389 --> 00:29:54,449
What did you say?
For your sake?

191
00:29:55,994 --> 00:29:59,293
You don't even know me.

192
00:30:00,331 --> 00:30:02,959
l know you very well.
- How?

193
00:30:04,002 --> 00:30:05,970
Through your poems.

194
00:30:07,672 --> 00:30:09,799
l know your thoughts
and feelings.

195
00:30:10,508 --> 00:30:12,476
What else is there?

196
00:30:14,679 --> 00:30:16,647
l don't understand.

197
00:30:21,019 --> 00:30:22,316
But, Miss...

198
00:30:22,520 --> 00:30:24,488
Why address me so politely?

199
00:30:26,357 --> 00:30:28,325
l am not used to it.

200
00:30:31,362 --> 00:30:35,822
Until today, people
have spoken rudely to me.

201
00:30:37,368 --> 00:30:40,826
l have suffered
their vulgar remarks...

202
00:30:42,207 --> 00:30:45,665
...their abuse, their crude jokes.

203
00:30:46,878 --> 00:30:50,837
But you behave so respectfully.

204
00:31:46,371 --> 00:31:50,501
Massage, oil massage,
make things gleam!

205
00:31:51,042 --> 00:31:55,445
''lf your head reels with pain,
or your heart sinks in gloom...''

206
00:31:56,147 --> 00:32:02,609
''Don't fret, leave it to me;
l'll set things right soon''

207
00:32:03,988 --> 00:32:05,615
''Massage, oil massage!''

208
00:32:31,883 --> 00:32:35,979
''The lotion l use has magic.
Curing baldness and dandruff"

209
00:32:36,521 --> 00:32:40,821
''Once my hands begin to whirl,
your hair won't look so rough''

210
00:32:51,703 --> 00:32:56,606
''Mark my words, my friend,
this lotion brings you joy"

211
00:33:01,980 --> 00:33:08,783
''lt cures a thousand ailments,
so why not give it a try?''

212
00:33:40,351 --> 00:33:44,481
''Suffering a lovers' tiff?
ls your business in the throes?''

213
00:33:45,189 --> 00:33:49,649
''A touch of this supple hand
will dissipate all woes''

214
00:34:02,974 --> 00:34:07,775
''Mark my words, my friends,
this lotion brings you joy"

215
00:34:48,686 --> 00:34:52,986
''Be you a master, be you a slave.
Be you a leader, or one of the led''

216
00:34:53,624 --> 00:34:58,254
''Come to me, as everyone does.
Come to me and bow your head''

217
00:35:08,973 --> 00:35:13,273
''Mark my words, my friend.
This lotion brings you joy"

218
00:35:18,649 --> 00:35:23,279
''lt cures a thousand ailments.
So why not give it a try?''

219
00:35:23,654 --> 00:35:27,784
''Don't fret, leave it to me...''

220
00:35:28,993 --> 00:35:32,952
''lf your head reels with pain,
or your heart sinks in gloom...''

221
00:35:33,664 --> 00:35:38,465
''Don't fret, leave it to me;
l'll set things right soon''

222
00:35:41,672 --> 00:35:43,799
Mr. Vijay, come here!

223
00:35:44,242 --> 00:35:48,474
A great poet: l was singing
one of his songs.

224
00:35:49,013 --> 00:35:54,076
Since l've been singing your
song, business has doubled.

225
00:35:55,286 --> 00:35:56,753
Don't go

226
00:35:57,054 --> 00:35:59,249
l'll just finish him.
- What?

227
00:35:59,624 --> 00:36:00,921
Stay put.

228
00:36:01,125 --> 00:36:05,755
Mr. Vijay, l'll give you a
special massage completely free.

229
00:36:06,797 --> 00:36:13,100
No, thank you. The present
times have battered me enough.

230
00:36:13,471 --> 00:36:17,771
lt's amazing how you still
manage to smile.

231
00:36:18,142 --> 00:36:21,771
Only a donkey in the noon sun...

232
00:36:21,913 --> 00:36:23,938
...and a poet lost in poetry
are so stunned.

233
00:36:24,315 --> 00:36:27,773
True, only the glitter of gold
is like the sun.

234
00:36:28,319 --> 00:36:30,116
So donkeys will.

235
00:36:30,321 --> 00:36:34,280
What are you talking about?
- We're discussing donkeys.

236
00:37:07,625 --> 00:37:09,593
Here l am.

237
00:37:13,631 --> 00:37:16,259
Juhi, weren't you
waiting for me?

238
00:37:17,802 --> 00:37:21,761
l'm waiting for a man in a car.
- ln a car? Not a masseur?

239
00:37:24,976 --> 00:37:26,944
May He puncture his tyres.

240
00:37:27,311 --> 00:37:29,279
May He puncture your head.

241
00:37:33,985 --> 00:37:36,954
Juhi, what happened?
- Are you cross with me?

242
00:37:37,321 --> 00:37:42,953
Have you no consideration for
the heart you've punctured?

243
00:37:43,160 --> 00:37:47,290
Get it patched up.
- l have no wife to patch it.

244
00:37:47,498 --> 00:37:50,467
What can l do about it?
- Marry me.

245
00:37:51,168 --> 00:37:53,136
Stop it, idiot!

246
00:37:53,938 --> 00:37:56,907
Did you hear? l have
the gift of massaging.

247
00:37:57,108 --> 00:38:00,407
lf l had the gift of cheating
we could afford a car.

248
00:38:01,445 --> 00:38:03,413
l'm done for!

249
00:38:05,449 --> 00:38:08,748
A coconut? l get it.
l won't say another word.

250
00:38:19,297 --> 00:38:23,757
Stop him, or l'll have to
chase him for a mile!

251
00:38:23,968 --> 00:38:27,597
Stop! Naughty fellow

252
00:38:28,139 --> 00:38:30,107
Hello, Pushpa.

253
00:38:31,642 --> 00:38:34,611
Vijay! l didn't recognize you.

254
00:38:35,313 --> 00:38:39,613
You were so handsome. Whose
''love'' brought you to this?

255
00:38:39,817 --> 00:38:44,277
Someone who won't let me go...
Unemployment.

256
00:38:46,157 --> 00:38:48,625
Your children?
- And their father's.

257
00:38:48,993 --> 00:38:53,623
They're Gullu and Fullu,
bright sparks like him.

258
00:38:53,831 --> 00:38:55,799
What do you mean?

259
00:38:56,334 --> 00:39:03,968
There's a gathering at our old
college tonight; you must come.

260
00:39:06,010 --> 00:39:11,141
Now l'll have to chase him
for a mile. l'll leave

261
00:39:15,686 --> 00:39:17,654
You must come tonight.

262
00:39:47,218 --> 00:39:51,518
Where is Bhattacharya?
He was going to sing next.

263
00:39:59,663 --> 00:40:03,292
Vijay, why hide out here?
Come inside.

264
00:40:04,168 --> 00:40:06,295
No, Pushpa. My clothes...

265
00:40:06,504 --> 00:40:12,136
You're decently covered
from head to foot. Come along.

266
00:40:22,520 --> 00:40:24,488
Ladies and gentleman.

267
00:40:24,688 --> 00:40:27,486
Bhattacharya isn't here.
We're delighted...

268
00:40:29,093 --> 00:40:31,823
...we're delighted
that Vijay is here...

269
00:40:32,029 --> 00:40:35,658
...and request him
to recite a poem.

270
00:40:36,200 --> 00:40:40,000
Don't be formal. Come along.

271
00:40:58,989 --> 00:41:00,616
Let's hear you, Vijay.

272
00:41:10,501 --> 00:41:18,465
''l am weary of this
troubled life''

273
00:41:20,344 --> 00:41:28,649
''Weary of this troubled existence''

274
00:41:30,354 --> 00:41:36,156
''ln my grief, may l not
reject the entire world''

275
00:41:36,360 --> 00:41:41,161
Why such a sad song on this
occasion? Recite a happy verse.

276
00:41:42,533 --> 00:41:45,161
''How can l sing of joy...''

277
00:41:45,536 --> 00:41:49,336
''if l live in pain''

278
00:41:56,814 --> 00:41:59,282
''l can only...''

279
00:41:59,483 --> 00:42:04,443
''...return to life what
life itself offers me''

280
00:42:16,166 --> 00:42:18,134
''Once again...''

281
00:42:18,269 --> 00:42:22,797
''...the memories of love
stir in my heart''

282
00:42:28,679 --> 00:42:30,647
''l confess...''

283
00:42:30,781 --> 00:42:36,481
''that l am overcome
by life's blows''

284
00:42:48,566 --> 00:42:51,831
''Today l break all belief...''

285
00:43:01,312 --> 00:43:05,271
''...in the illusion of hope''

286
00:43:09,987 --> 00:43:12,114
''Today l vow...''

287
00:43:12,656 --> 00:43:17,457
''to voice no complaint
against anyone''

288
00:43:44,355 --> 00:43:47,984
Are you an ex-student?

289
00:43:53,364 --> 00:43:55,264
Have you a job?

290
00:43:56,967 --> 00:43:58,935
No, l need one.

291
00:44:00,804 --> 00:44:02,772
You recite very well.

292
00:44:07,478 --> 00:44:10,447
Here's my card.
Come to my office tomorrow.

293
00:44:16,987 --> 00:44:18,955

Here are my poems.

294
00:44:42,346 --> 00:44:45,804
When did you study at college?
- From '48 to '52.

295
00:44:46,350 --> 00:44:48,978
Shall l read the poems aloud?

l married in 1952.

297
00:44:59,963 --> 00:45:01,931
Did you study science or arts?

298
00:45:03,967 --> 00:45:07,266
Arts. May l recite the poems?

299
00:45:09,139 --> 00:45:13,769
You're sure you left college
in '52, or was it before?

300
00:45:15,813 --> 00:45:21,274
ln '52. Mr. Ghosh, my poems?
- Will you work?

301
00:45:23,487 --> 00:45:29,619
Service? l thought you called me
about publishing my poems.

302
00:45:30,327 --> 00:45:33,626
There's still plenty of time
to publish your poems.

303
00:45:34,665 --> 00:45:37,133
l must get to know
you better first.

304
00:45:42,339 --> 00:45:44,967
Mr. Chatterji, this is
your new assistant.

You can start tomorrow.

''lf l were to lock
your heart away"

308

''lf l were to adorn your hair
with flowers of love''

309
00:49:16,687 --> 00:49:22,648
''lf l were to shake the flowers
to the ground''

310

''lf l were to remember you
in my dreams''

311

''lf l were to lay my heart
at your feet''

313
00:50:53,817 --> 00:50:59,949
''lf l were to deny your love
and walk away"

314
00:52:54,137 --> 00:52:57,106
How have you been?
- l'm alive.

315
00:53:00,310 --> 00:53:03,609
l want to see you happy.

316
00:53:03,813 --> 00:53:09,774
Don't worry. l have
learnt to be happy.

317
00:53:10,987 --> 00:53:12,955
Has some girl taught you?

318
00:53:13,990 --> 00:53:18,290
One girl was enough for me.

319
00:53:20,163 --> 00:53:22,131
l don't want to suffer again.

320
00:53:22,999 --> 00:53:26,628
You mean you have erased
your first love.

321
00:53:27,337 --> 00:53:28,634
l should have.

322
00:53:34,177 --> 00:53:38,978
l forgot: l was really going up.

323
00:54:11,982 --> 00:54:18,114
Closing time. Three hours
you've waited. For whom?

324
00:54:35,171 --> 00:54:38,299
Does Mr. Vijay come here often?

325
00:54:38,508 --> 00:54:42,308
Yes, but not lately.
Any message for him?

326
00:54:52,355 --> 00:54:56,917
So you find something to say
to the waiter. How about me?

327
00:55:03,633 --> 00:55:05,601
Have you had time
to look at them?

328
00:55:07,304 --> 00:55:10,603
- Which papers?
- Vijay calls them his poetry.

329
00:55:10,974 --> 00:55:14,273
l've read them, they're fine.

330
00:55:16,146 --> 00:55:18,114
Why not publish some?

331
00:55:19,816 --> 00:55:21,283
Are you mad?

332
00:55:21,985 --> 00:55:27,446
You must know we publish famous
poets, not the trash of novices.

333
00:55:28,158 --> 00:55:30,285
Put in an advertisement instead.

334
00:55:40,003 --> 00:55:41,971
What do you want?

335
00:55:43,840 --> 00:55:46,809
Sir, this trash of a novice...

336
00:55:47,844 --> 00:55:49,812
...may l take it away?

337
00:56:03,293 --> 00:56:06,751
Are you free tomorrow evening?
-

338
00:56:07,964 --> 00:56:11,092
Come and lend a hand
at a party in my house.

339
00:56:12,802 --> 00:56:14,770
l'll be there.

340
00:56:27,317 --> 00:56:29,945
lt's no good getting upset, Juhi.

341
00:56:30,153 --> 00:56:34,112
Who will care for you
in your old age?

342
00:56:34,657 --> 00:56:35,624
God willing.

343
00:56:35,759 --> 00:56:40,287
Be careful, or a nut
will fall on you.

344
00:56:40,663 --> 00:56:43,791
lf you want security,
listen to me.

345
00:56:45,502 --> 00:56:47,629
lf l listen to you, l'll starve.

346
00:56:48,838 --> 00:56:52,797
You can hardly keep yourself,
how can you feed me, too?

347
00:56:55,945 --> 00:56:59,745
My hunger will be satisfied
by seeing you in my house.

348
00:57:01,951 --> 00:57:03,919
Really?

349
00:57:04,454 --> 00:57:07,582
Abdul Sattar, do you
love me that much?

350
00:57:09,959 --> 00:57:12,757
Let's marry.
- Stop, it idiot!

351
00:57:14,631 --> 00:57:16,929
Do you hear? No, nothing.

352
00:57:20,470 --> 00:57:21,596
No nut.

353
00:57:26,810 --> 00:57:29,278
Your husband?
- He's ill.

354
00:57:29,479 --> 00:57:32,778
He wanted me to take him to
hospital, but l put it off.

355
00:57:33,149 --> 00:57:35,447
How could l miss such a party?

356
00:57:36,319 --> 00:57:38,446
You're very kind!

357
00:57:45,328 --> 00:57:47,296
And the children?

358
00:57:54,103 --> 00:57:56,071
How did you get my address?

359
00:57:56,773 --> 00:58:00,732
Your address? Do you live here?

360
00:58:01,110 --> 00:58:02,907
Let's go outside.

361
00:58:03,112 --> 00:58:06,411
Mr. Ghosh told me to come.

362
00:58:07,784 --> 00:58:11,242
Told you? Do you know him?

363
00:58:12,288 --> 00:58:14,256
l work for him.

364
00:58:15,458 --> 00:58:18,757
And you?
- l am his...

365
00:58:19,128 --> 00:58:21,926
Who is the most
talented poet here?

366
00:58:22,465 --> 00:58:24,262
They are all good.

367
00:58:24,467 --> 00:58:27,265
But the one
in the black jacket is...

368
00:58:33,977 --> 00:58:37,936
Don't tell him about us.
Understand?

369
00:58:45,321 --> 00:58:49,280
Poems that serve the nation
are better than...

370
00:58:49,425 --> 00:58:51,290
...love poems.

371
00:58:51,995 --> 00:58:54,463
Gentleman, drop this argument.

372
00:58:55,665 --> 00:58:57,792
The drinks are here.

373
00:59:00,837 --> 00:59:03,135
Leave it to the servant, dear.

374
00:59:05,341 --> 00:59:08,640
Come along, serve the drinks.

375
00:59:20,423 --> 00:59:23,824
''How could l...''

376
00:59:24,360 --> 00:59:27,659
''apprise her of my love?''

377
00:59:28,364 --> 00:59:31,492
''The words froze on my lips''

378
00:59:32,035 --> 00:59:35,004
''Tears welled in my eyes''

379
00:59:37,106 --> 00:59:40,007
''ln the gallantry
of frigid hearts''

380
00:59:40,543 --> 00:59:43,842
''Where pleasure is sought''

381
00:59:44,614 --> 00:59:47,515
''Clammy fingers cling
to the cup of whine''

382
00:59:48,051 --> 00:59:51,020
''l quaffed the wine,
a drop was spilled''

383
01:00:01,497 --> 01:00:06,628
''An extreme despair
came to my rescue''

384
01:00:07,770 --> 01:00:12,969
''Receiving my poet, out of pity,
she deigned to love me''

385
01:00:19,182 --> 01:00:25,485
''Who are the fortunate ones...''

386
01:00:26,689 --> 01:00:29,658
''who gain the love they seek?''

387
01:00:32,528 --> 01:00:37,488
Great, Mr Ghosh!
Even your servants recite poems

388
01:00:39,369 --> 01:00:41,337
l'll arrange for the dinner
Can only the rich be poets?

389
01:00:45,708 --> 01:00:48,506
Go ahead, young man

390
01:01:01,491 --> 01:01:09,125
''When l asked for flowers,
l was given thorns''

391
01:01:11,768 --> 01:01:16,296
''Who are the fortunate ones...''

392
01:01:16,506 --> 01:01:19,304
''who gain the love they seek?''

393
01:01:29,352 --> 01:01:33,652
''When l searched for happiness...''

394
01:01:34,023 --> 01:01:36,992
''l was lost in streets
of sadness''

395
01:01:49,372 --> 01:01:56,938
''When l sought songs of joy,
l heard songs of sorrow"

396
01:01:58,981 --> 01:02:06,945
''Every torment doubled
the pain my heart''

397
01:02:09,158 --> 01:02:16,963
''When l asked for flowers,
l was given thorns''

398
01:02:19,335 --> 01:02:23,795
''Who were the fortunate ones...''

399
01:02:24,173 --> 01:02:26,971
''who got the love they sought''

400
01:02:36,786 --> 01:02:42,986
''Companions came...''

401
01:02:46,562 --> 01:02:54,264
''Companions came, stayed awhile,
then left me all alone''

402
01:02:56,472 --> 01:03:04,436
''Who can spare the time to clasp
the hand of a falling man?''

403
01:03:06,315 --> 01:03:13,949
''Even my shadow eludes me
as it fades away"

404
01:03:16,425 --> 01:03:24,127
''When l asked for flowers,
l was given thorns''

405
01:03:26,335 --> 01:03:33,969
''Who are the fortunate ones
who gain the love they seek?''

406
01:03:43,853 --> 01:03:51,487
''lf this is called living,
then l'll live my life somehow"

407
01:04:03,973 --> 01:04:11,436
''l shall not sigh, l'll seal my lips,
l'll dry my tears''

408
01:04:13,649 --> 01:04:21,283
''Why should l fear grief,
when l have encountered it so often?''

409
01:04:23,492 --> 01:04:31,297
''When l asked for flowers,
l was given thorns''

410
01:04:33,336 --> 01:04:41,141
''Who are the fortunate ones
who gain the love they seek?''

411
01:04:44,780 --> 01:04:46,748
Wonderful! Excellent!

412
01:05:15,311 --> 01:05:17,279
l have come to see you.

413
01:05:25,321 --> 01:05:28,449
Mr. Ghosh has gone
to the board meeting.

414
01:05:30,326 --> 01:05:32,294
You shouldn't have come.

415
01:05:36,832 --> 01:05:39,960
l have been very upset
since the party.

416
01:05:41,671 --> 01:05:43,639
Do you bear me ill will?

417
01:05:44,340 --> 01:05:48,470
No, Meena.
l bear no grudge.

418
01:05:54,951 --> 01:05:59,081
Why did you sing that
heart-rending poem that day?

419
01:06:04,961 --> 01:06:09,091
You revived my desires.
- Forget the past.

420
01:06:12,134 --> 01:06:17,094
l had forgotten,
l had remoulded my life.

421
01:06:18,140 --> 01:06:20,108
l controlled my heart.

422
01:06:23,646 --> 01:06:27,275
Why disturb my heart?
Why return to my life?

423
01:06:28,150 --> 01:06:33,281
When did l ever leave
your life? You left me.

424
01:06:34,323 --> 01:06:41,126
Do not try to correct your first
mistake with another, Meena.

425
01:06:41,664 --> 01:06:43,632
l've made no mistake.

426
01:06:44,166 --> 01:06:48,796
Besides love, a sensible woman needs
security and the comfort of a home.

427
01:06:49,338 --> 01:06:51,465
And some money is also required.

428
01:06:53,509 --> 01:06:55,067
For those things...

429
01:06:55,277 --> 01:07:00,579
You married Mr. Ghosh,
selling love for wealth.

430
01:07:00,950 --> 01:07:02,918
Don't accuse me wrongly.

431
01:07:04,954 --> 01:07:09,254
l loved you, but you
were poor and unemployed.

432
01:07:10,126 --> 01:07:14,586
ln life, besides love
and poetry, there's hunger.

433
01:07:15,297 --> 01:07:19,927
How could you bear my burden
when you couldn't feed yourself?

434
01:07:20,636 --> 01:07:22,604
You gave me no chance.

435
01:07:23,305 --> 01:07:27,435
When a man has responsibilities,
he shoulders them.

436
01:07:27,977 --> 01:07:29,945
Don't deceive yourself.

437
01:07:30,479 --> 01:07:35,781
You sought wealth and
high position in society.

438
01:07:36,318 --> 01:07:40,778
Now you have them. Despite that,
you are restless and resentful.

439
01:07:40,990 --> 01:07:42,958
You know why?

440
01:07:43,993 --> 01:07:46,621
Because you have always
been selfish.

441
01:07:48,497 --> 01:07:51,125
You never considered my plight.

442
01:07:52,668 --> 01:07:56,229
Now you don't
consider your husband.

443
01:08:01,777 --> 01:08:07,238
Life's real joy lies
in making others happy.

444
01:08:08,284 --> 01:08:12,914
You've never understood that;
that's why you're unhappy.

445
01:08:26,635 --> 01:08:28,102
Wonderful!

446
01:08:28,304 --> 01:08:30,932
My wife's no better
than a streetwalker.

447
01:08:31,140 --> 01:08:34,439
Vijay and l hardly know each other.

448
01:08:34,643 --> 01:08:36,770
How long has this been going on?

449
01:08:36,912 --> 01:08:38,880
We hardly know each other.

450
01:08:39,048 --> 01:08:41,016
Anything else?
- Nothing.

451
01:08:42,318 --> 01:08:47,620
Then let's see how upset you are
when l dismiss him.

452
01:09:02,671 --> 01:09:06,300
Pay up!
- l earn my money the hard way.

453
01:09:06,675 --> 01:09:08,643
Scoundrel! Pay Up!

454
01:09:10,579 --> 01:09:12,137
Constable!

455
01:09:57,993 --> 01:09:59,961
Save me, do something!

456
01:10:02,498 --> 01:10:03,965
You?

457
01:10:05,000 --> 01:10:06,968
What's the matter?

458
01:10:10,005 --> 01:10:11,973
Has a girl run this way?

459
01:10:13,008 --> 01:10:14,305
No.

460
01:10:14,510 --> 01:10:18,469
Who is she?
- My wife.

461
01:10:21,850 --> 01:10:23,977
Sorry sir, l made a mistake.

462
01:10:27,690 --> 01:10:29,658
What is your name?

463
01:10:33,195 --> 01:10:34,492
Gulab.

464
01:10:35,197 --> 01:10:38,997
lt's all clear now.
You can go safely.

465
01:11:06,495 --> 01:11:13,628
''Tormented by a long absence...''

466
01:11:16,505 --> 01:11:18,473
''Radha longed...''

467
01:11:22,177 --> 01:11:25,635
''for her lover''

468
01:11:27,516 --> 01:11:35,821
''One day she went...''

469
01:11:40,362 --> 01:11:44,992
''to her beloved and lamented''

470
01:11:52,041 --> 01:11:56,944
''Hold me in your arms
today, my love...''

471
01:11:57,146 --> 01:12:00,115
''so that l am fulfilled''

472
01:12:11,760 --> 01:12:15,958
''Ease the pain in my heart...''

473
01:12:16,498 --> 01:12:19,956
