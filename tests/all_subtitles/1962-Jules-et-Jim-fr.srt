<i>It was around 1912.</i>

13
00:01:30,746 --> 00:01:33,340
<i>Jules, a foreigner in Paris,</i>
<i>asked Jim, whom he hardly knew,</i>

14
00:01:33,449 --> 00:01:35,178
<i>to get him into the Art Students' Ball.</i>

15
00:01:35,284 --> 00:01:38,344
<i>Jim got him a ticket</i>
<i>and a costume.</i>

16
00:01:38,454 --> 00:01:42,413
<i>While Jules was hunting for</i>
<i>a slave costume...</i>

17
00:01:42,525 --> 00:01:44,755
<i>their friendship was born.</i>

18
00:01:44,861 --> 00:01:49,457
<i>It grew as Jules watched the ball</i>
<i>with his kind tender eyes.</i>

19
00:01:50,333 --> 00:01:54,030
<i>The next day, they had</i>
<i>their first real conversation.</i>

20
00:01:54,136 --> 00:01:57,162
<i>Each taught the other his language</i>
<i>and his culture until late at night.</i>

21
00:01:57,273 --> 00:02:00,037
<i>They translated</i>
<i>each other's poetry.</i>

22
00:02:00,710 --> 00:02:03,406
<i>They shared</i>
<i>an indifference for money.</i>

23
00:02:03,513 --> 00:02:07,142
<i>They talked,</i>
<i>and they listened to each other.</i>

24
00:02:07,250 --> 00:02:10,083
<i>Jules had no girls in Paris</i>
<i>and he wanted one.</i>

25
00:02:10,186 --> 00:02:13,815
<i>Jim had several.</i>
<i>He introduced Jules to a musician.</i>

26
00:02:13,923 --> 00:02:17,620
<i>They were in love for about a week.</i>

27
00:02:17,727 --> 00:02:22,596
<i>Then came a sweet thing</i>
<i>who loved to talk all night.</i>

28
00:02:22,698 --> 00:02:25,861
<i>And a pretty blonde widow</i>
<i>who made them a trio.</i>

29
00:02:25,968 --> 00:02:28,163
<i>She confused Jules.</i>
<i>She found him nice, but clumsy.</i>

30
00:02:28,271 --> 00:02:31,502
<i>She brought him a quiet friend</i>
<i>who was too quiet.</i>

31
00:02:31,607 --> 00:02:34,804
<i>Despite Jim's advice, Jules</i>
<i>got in contact with professionals...</i>

32
00:02:34,911 --> 00:02:37,072
<i>but found no satisfaction.</i>

33
00:02:42,585 --> 00:02:44,018
Let's get to work.

34
00:02:58,668 --> 00:03:01,728
"Down with everything"

35
00:03:01,837 --> 00:03:03,805
No more paint, you bitch.

36
00:03:03,906 --> 00:03:05,931
They'll say
anarchists can't spell, again.

37
00:03:08,311 --> 00:03:09,903
Save me! He's after me!

38
00:03:10,012 --> 00:03:12,173
He's stronger than you!
Let's run!

39
00:03:14,016 --> 00:03:15,608
Can you put me up for the night?

40
00:03:15,718 --> 00:03:17,777
- I'm Therese.
- Of course, Therese.

41
00:03:17,887 --> 00:03:20,117
You can't stay with me.
I've got a date.

42
00:03:20,222 --> 00:03:24,454
Gilberte? But Jules can...
That's me...

43
00:03:24,560 --> 00:03:26,926
And who're you?
Jim and Jules, then?

44
00:03:27,029 --> 00:03:28,963
No, Jules and Jim.

45
00:03:52,855 --> 00:03:53,981
What's that?

46
00:03:54,824 --> 00:03:59,784
It's better than a clock.
When the sand stops, I must go to sleep.

47
00:04:15,578 --> 00:04:19,014
- You'll sleep here and me there.
- I see.

48
00:04:19,115 --> 00:04:21,709
- Got a cigarette?
- Of course.

49
00:04:24,654 --> 00:04:26,815
- Are you Jim?
- No, Jules.

50
00:04:28,024 --> 00:04:29,787
You're sweet.

51
00:04:33,129 --> 00:04:35,097
I'll show you a steam engine.

52
00:04:55,518 --> 00:04:56,780
It's almost dawn.

53
00:04:56,886 --> 00:05:00,151
Jim, you might stay here
with me for once.

54
00:05:00,256 --> 00:05:01,746
No, Gilberte.

55
00:05:01,857 --> 00:05:04,917
If I stayed only once,
I'd feel guilty.

56
00:05:05,027 --> 00:05:08,428
If I stayed longer,
we'd be almost married.

57
00:05:08,531 --> 00:05:11,694
- That's against our rules!
- What a twisted mind.

58
00:05:11,801 --> 00:05:14,668
And the cat doesn't like
to stay at home alone.

59
00:05:14,770 --> 00:05:17,364
Besides, it's morning.

60
00:05:17,473 --> 00:05:20,442
Just imagine that I'm going to work.

61
00:05:25,481 --> 00:05:28,712
You're going home to sleep until noon.

62
00:05:50,072 --> 00:05:54,008
No, it was Shakespeare.

63
00:05:58,314 --> 00:06:00,509
Give me a dime for the music.

64
00:06:00,616 --> 00:06:03,881
It was Shakespeare,
I tell you.

65
00:06:11,727 --> 00:06:13,558
Do you have a cigarette?

66
00:06:21,370 --> 00:06:24,430
Can you put me up for the night?
I'm Therese.

67
00:06:33,082 --> 00:06:37,576
Forget it. There are more
where she came from.

68
00:06:38,354 --> 00:06:42,017
I wasn't in love with her.

69
00:06:42,124 --> 00:06:44,820
She was both mother and daughter to me.

70
00:06:47,396 --> 00:06:49,489
I'm not lucky in Paris.

71
00:06:49,598 --> 00:06:52,465
Good thing I know girls back home.

72
00:06:52,735 --> 00:06:54,930
I love one, Lucie.

73
00:06:55,037 --> 00:06:57,335
She refused to marry me.

74
00:06:57,439 --> 00:07:00,602
I've decided to wait 6 months,
and ask her again.

75
00:07:01,844 --> 00:07:04,608
There's another, too.
Birgitta.

76
00:07:04,713 --> 00:07:06,943
And there's Elga.

77
00:07:07,049 --> 00:07:10,382
I'd love her
if I didn't love Lucie.

78
00:07:10,486 --> 00:07:12,977
This is what she looks like.

79
00:07:17,426 --> 00:07:20,953
<i>Jules sketched a woman's face</i>
<i>on the table.</i>

80
00:07:23,499 --> 00:07:25,660
<i>Jim wanted to buy the table...</i>

81
00:07:25,768 --> 00:07:28,601
<i>but the owner wanted</i>
<i>to sell the whole set.</i>

82
00:07:32,274 --> 00:07:33,241
Albert.

83
00:07:34,743 --> 00:07:36,404
This is Jim, a French friend.

84
00:07:42,484 --> 00:07:44,418
Hello. I think we've met before.

85
00:07:46,522 --> 00:07:48,080
Sit down.

86
00:07:52,261 --> 00:07:54,422
- <i>Jim had asked...</i>
- <i>Who is Albert?</i>

87
00:07:54,530 --> 00:07:57,260
<i>The artists' friend.</i>

88
00:07:57,366 --> 00:08:01,132
<i>He knows everyone</i>
<i>who'll be famous in ten years.</i>

89
00:08:05,374 --> 00:08:07,569
This is more exotic.

90
00:08:07,676 --> 00:08:10,668
She looks like an Incan statue.

91
00:08:11,947 --> 00:08:15,781
This one is somewhat Romanesque.

92
00:08:15,885 --> 00:08:19,946
It's weathered because
I found it in the garden.

93
00:08:20,055 --> 00:08:22,114
It was out in the rain for years.

94
00:08:22,224 --> 00:08:26,285
This one is very touching.

95
00:08:28,397 --> 00:08:31,332
Reminds you of a decaying face.

96
00:08:31,433 --> 00:08:35,597
Strange to see stone
worked so flabbily.

97
00:08:40,743 --> 00:08:43,337
This face has beautiful lips.

98
00:08:43,445 --> 00:08:46,175
They're scornful.
Admirable eyes, too.

99
00:08:49,618 --> 00:08:52,178
May we see that last one again?

100
00:08:55,457 --> 00:08:57,891
I made a close-up of it, too.

101
00:08:57,993 --> 00:09:00,223
<i>The slide showed</i>
<i>a woman's face...</i>

102
00:09:00,329 --> 00:09:02,820
<i>whose tranquil smile gripped them.</i>

103
00:09:03,799 --> 00:09:08,236
<i>The statue was in an outdoor</i>
<i>museum on an Adriatic island.</i>

104
00:09:08,337 --> 00:09:10,805
<i>They left immediately to see it.</i>

105
00:09:10,906 --> 00:09:12,897
<i>They wore</i>
<i>the same white outfits.</i>

106
00:09:20,049 --> 00:09:23,212
<i>They stared at the face</i>
<i>for an hour.</i>

107
00:09:23,319 --> 00:09:25,446
<i>It stunned them into silence.</i>

108
00:09:25,554 --> 00:09:29,251
<i>They were speechless.</i>
<i>Had they ever met such a smile?</i>

109
00:09:29,358 --> 00:09:32,919
<i>No. If they ever met it,</i>
<i>they would follow it.</i>

110
00:09:34,063 --> 00:09:37,294
<i>Jules and Jim</i>
<i>returned home dazzled.</i>

111
00:09:38,133 --> 00:09:39,191
<i>Paris greeted them gently.</i>

112
00:09:57,820 --> 00:10:01,085
- How is your book?
- It's coming along.

113
00:10:02,691 --> 00:10:06,457
It will be rather autobiographical.

114
00:10:06,562 --> 00:10:09,292
Our friendship had
a major part in it.

115
00:10:09,398 --> 00:10:10,865
I'd love to have you read
an excerpt from it.

116
00:10:10,966 --> 00:10:12,058
Please do.

117
00:10:19,641 --> 00:10:21,632
"Jacques and Julien were inseparable.

118
00:10:21,744 --> 00:10:23,974
Julien's last novel
was successful.

119
00:10:24,079 --> 00:10:26,946
In it, he described
the enchanting women he had known...

120
00:10:27,049 --> 00:10:29,745
...before he had met Jacques
and even Lucienne.

121
00:10:29,852 --> 00:10:31,717
Jacques was proud of Julien.

122
00:10:31,887 --> 00:10:33,650
People called them
Don Quixote and Sancho Panza...

123
00:10:33,756 --> 00:10:37,089
and they never knew that neighbors
found their friendship ambiguous.

124
00:10:37,192 --> 00:10:39,251
They ate together
in small restaurants.

125
00:10:39,361 --> 00:10:42,990
They bought for one another
the best cigars."

126
00:10:43,098 --> 00:10:44,895
It's beautiful.

127
00:10:45,000 --> 00:10:49,596
Let me translate it into German.

128
00:10:49,705 --> 00:10:51,434
Now, for a shower.

129
00:10:55,377 --> 00:10:57,538
My cousin just wrote me.

130
00:10:58,113 --> 00:11:01,605
Three girls he knows
are coming to Paris.

131
00:11:01,717 --> 00:11:04,550
One is German, one is Dutch,
and one is French.

132
00:11:04,653 --> 00:11:07,645
They're coming to dinner tomorrow.

133
00:11:07,756 --> 00:11:09,690
I want you to join us.

134
00:11:15,364 --> 00:11:18,856
<i>Catherine, the French girl,</i>
<i>was the statue.</i>

135
00:11:18,967 --> 00:11:21,197
<i>She had the same smile, nose,</i>
<i>mouth, chin, and forehead.</i>

136
00:11:21,336 --> 00:11:23,600
<i>As a child, she had</i>
<i>been idolized in her hometown...</i>

137
00:11:23,705 --> 00:11:25,070
<i>during a religious celebration.</i>

138
00:11:25,174 --> 00:11:26,505
<i>It started almost like a dream.</i>

139
00:11:26,608 --> 00:11:30,669
As your host, I propose...

140
00:11:30,779 --> 00:11:35,739
that we would abolish
all formalities forever...

141
00:11:36,051 --> 00:11:40,647
by drinking my best wine
in brotherhood.

142
00:11:40,756 --> 00:11:44,522
Instead of linking arms
in the usual way...

143
00:11:44,626 --> 00:11:48,153
let us touch feet under the table.

144
00:11:48,263 --> 00:11:51,858
<i>Jules was happy</i>
<i>and moved his feet away.</i>

145
00:11:51,967 --> 00:11:54,367
<i>Jim's foot stayed near Catherine's.</i>

146
00:11:54,470 --> 00:11:56,734
<i>She moved hers away first.</i>

147
00:11:58,240 --> 00:12:00,674
<i>Jules smiled happily...</i>

148
00:12:00,776 --> 00:12:03,006
<i>as he beamed at the others.</i>

149
00:12:04,913 --> 00:12:06,471
<i>Jules vanished for a month.</i>

150
00:12:06,582 --> 00:12:08,049
<i>He saw Catherine alone...</i>

151
00:12:08,150 --> 00:12:11,415
<i>but the two friends</i>
<i>met at the gymnasium.</i>

152
00:12:14,957 --> 00:12:16,185
Excellent.

153
00:12:16,692 --> 00:12:19,991
Why don't you spend the evening
with Catherine and me?

154
00:12:23,932 --> 00:12:25,661
I've talked about you so much...

155
00:12:25,767 --> 00:12:29,828
Catherine is anxious
to know you better...

156
00:12:29,938 --> 00:12:33,601
but not this one, Jim. Okay?

157
00:12:41,116 --> 00:12:42,777
Hello, Mr. Jim.

158
00:12:46,788 --> 00:12:50,451
Pronounce his name in English,
not French.

159
00:12:53,395 --> 00:12:56,159
"Jeem" doesn't suit him.

160
00:13:02,704 --> 00:13:05,764
Do you like our friend Thomas?

161
00:13:06,308 --> 00:13:08,435
Can we go out with him?

162
00:13:09,111 --> 00:13:12,740
Not bad. A moustache would help.

163
00:13:25,427 --> 00:13:27,486
Now for a test in the street.

164
00:13:37,839 --> 00:13:41,240
Excuse me, sir.
Do you have a match?

165
00:13:46,615 --> 00:13:47,980
Thank you, sir.

166
00:13:51,086 --> 00:13:53,179
<i>She was proud</i>
<i>of her clever disguise.</i>

167
00:13:53,288 --> 00:13:56,451
<i>The men were moved,</i>
<i>but didn't really understand why.</i>

168
00:13:56,558 --> 00:13:59,857
- Either it's raining or I'm dreaming!
- It might be both.

169
00:14:08,437 --> 00:14:10,632
Then if it's raining,
let's go to the seashore.

170
00:14:11,206 --> 00:14:12,195
We go tomorrow.

171
00:14:14,243 --> 00:14:17,235
Let's have a race.

172
00:14:17,346 --> 00:14:20,042
First one to the end of the bridge.

173
00:14:45,774 --> 00:14:47,867
- You cheated.
- But I won.

174
00:14:47,976 --> 00:14:49,273
Thomas always wins.

175
00:14:49,378 --> 00:14:52,245
He speaks three languages,
he swims like a fish.

176
00:14:52,347 --> 00:14:53,905
Can he stand on his hands?

177
00:14:54,016 --> 00:14:55,347
You'll teach him.

178
00:14:56,985 --> 00:14:59,749
Can you come to my flat tomorrow...

179
00:14:59,855 --> 00:15:03,256
to help take my baggage
to the station?

180
00:15:05,360 --> 00:15:06,520
She's a strange breed.

181
00:15:06,628 --> 00:15:10,189
Her father was an aristocrat,
her mother wasn't.

182
00:15:10,299 --> 00:15:14,599
He came from Burgundy.
Her mother was English.

183
00:15:14,703 --> 00:15:17,194
That's why she's not average...

184
00:15:17,306 --> 00:15:19,638
and she teaches everyone.

185
00:15:19,741 --> 00:15:22,209
- Teaches what?
- Shakespeare.

186
00:15:24,846 --> 00:15:28,509
<i>Jim took it for granted</i>
<i>that she belonged to Jules.</i>

187
00:15:28,617 --> 00:15:31,381
<i>Catherine wore that calm smile.</i>

188
00:15:31,486 --> 00:15:34,421
<i>It was natural and said everything.</i>

189
00:15:39,161 --> 00:15:41,755
I'm almost ready.
I just have to put on my dress.

190
00:15:42,464 --> 00:15:44,830
- Never put a hat on a bed.
- Do we take the bike?

191
00:15:53,775 --> 00:15:54,901
And the bag, too?

192
00:15:58,413 --> 00:16:01,177
- What are you doing?
- I want to burn lies.

193
00:16:02,718 --> 00:16:04,015
Give me a match.

194
00:16:13,895 --> 00:16:16,887
- Oh, my God!
- Don't move.

195
00:16:28,777 --> 00:16:31,507
- Are you alright?
- Hand me the dress.

196
00:16:31,613 --> 00:16:32,875
It's by the bed.

197
00:16:39,287 --> 00:16:41,778
- Got a broom?
- It's under your nose.

198
00:17:02,878 --> 00:17:04,140
Can you help me?

199
00:17:13,755 --> 00:17:14,722
Thanks.

200
00:17:20,729 --> 00:17:22,356
We'll take this, too.

201
00:17:23,965 --> 00:17:25,023
What is it?

202
00:17:25,133 --> 00:17:27,863
Vitriol, for the eyes of men who lie.

203
00:17:28,303 --> 00:17:30,771
That bottle will break
and ruin your things.

204
00:17:30,872 --> 00:17:33,033
Besides, you can buy Vitriol anywhere.

205
00:17:33,141 --> 00:17:35,268
- Is that true?
- Yes.

206
00:17:35,377 --> 00:17:37,368
But not this bottle.

207
00:17:37,479 --> 00:17:39,777
I swore I'd only use this bottle.

208
00:18:20,856 --> 00:18:22,289
<i>It took them a while...</i>

209
00:18:22,390 --> 00:18:25,848
<i>to find the house of their dreams</i>
<i>along the coast.</i>

210
00:18:25,961 --> 00:18:29,124
<i>It was too big and isolated,</i>
<i>solemn, white, and empty.</i>

211
00:18:32,467 --> 00:18:34,731
- Sleep well?
- Very well.

212
00:18:34,836 --> 00:18:38,101
- Is Jim awake?
- I don't know.

213
00:18:43,178 --> 00:18:45,976
- How is everyone else?
- Everyone else is fine.

214
00:18:47,883 --> 00:18:49,111
What a nice day.

215
00:18:50,018 --> 00:18:52,043
Hurry, let's go to the beach.

216
00:18:58,493 --> 00:19:01,587
Let's find the last signs
of civilization.

217
00:19:01,696 --> 00:19:03,425
A piece of tire.

218
00:19:06,735 --> 00:19:11,468
- Look, a bottle!
- An old shoe.

219
00:19:20,916 --> 00:19:24,875
A can!
Watch out back there.

220
00:19:30,926 --> 00:19:32,621
Look, Catherine.

221
00:19:38,366 --> 00:19:40,834
Watch out, it's steep.

222
00:19:45,240 --> 00:19:46,571
A postcard.

223
00:19:52,113 --> 00:19:54,047
A piece of porcelain.

224
00:19:55,717 --> 00:19:58,151
A cup and a cigarette butt.

225
00:20:04,292 --> 00:20:08,319
- A pack of English cigarettes.
- I'm afraid we're lost, kids.

226
00:20:23,078 --> 00:20:25,808
Do you think I should marry her?

227
00:20:25,914 --> 00:20:27,905
Answer me honestly.

228
00:20:28,016 --> 00:20:30,450
Is she cut out
to be a wife and mother?

229
00:20:30,552 --> 00:20:34,215
I'm afraid she will never
be happy on this earth.

230
00:20:34,322 --> 00:20:37,689
She has a vision. Maybe
she can't belong to just one man.

231
00:20:37,792 --> 00:20:39,919
- Let's go.
- No.

232
00:20:40,028 --> 00:20:42,758
This time, I won't move.
I give up.

233
00:20:58,613 --> 00:21:01,776
Help me, kids.

234
00:21:17,832 --> 00:21:20,596
Let's go, kids.

235
00:21:45,627 --> 00:21:47,424
At last, I read a book I liked.

236
00:21:47,529 --> 00:21:50,157
A writer, a German, of course...

237
00:21:50,265 --> 00:21:52,961
who dares to say out loud
what I think inside.

238
00:21:53,068 --> 00:21:56,697
The sky that we see is merely
a small hollow ball...

239
00:21:56,805 --> 00:21:58,773
no bigger than that.

240
00:21:58,873 --> 00:22:02,900
And we walk
with our heads towards the center.

241
00:22:13,955 --> 00:22:17,652
The attraction pulls towards
the outside under our feet...

242
00:22:17,759 --> 00:22:21,957
towards that solid crust
in which the bubble is enclosed.

243
00:22:22,063 --> 00:22:24,031
How thick is the crust
and what's beyond it?

244
00:22:24,132 --> 00:22:25,099
Go and see.

245
00:22:25,200 --> 00:22:27,828
That's not a question
to discuss between gentlemen.

246
00:22:40,582 --> 00:22:42,641
Answer me tomorrow, Catherine.

247
00:22:42,751 --> 00:22:44,150
If you say no...

248
00:22:44,252 --> 00:22:48,916
I will ask you every year again
on your birthday.

249
00:22:49,023 --> 00:22:50,581
You've known few women.

250
00:22:50,692 --> 00:22:53,593
I've known plenty of men.
It averages out.

251
00:22:53,695 --> 00:22:56,630
We might make an honest couple.

252
00:23:10,178 --> 00:23:13,341
I've proposed to her.
She almost said yes.

253
00:23:20,855 --> 00:23:23,722
At fifteen,
I was in love with Napoleon.

254
00:23:23,958 --> 00:23:26,825
I dreamt I met him in an elevator.

255
00:23:26,928 --> 00:23:29,863
We had a child
and I never saw him again.

256
00:23:31,399 --> 00:23:33,230
Poor Napoleon.

257
00:23:33,635 --> 00:23:36,263
I was taught:
Our father who arts in heaven.

258
00:23:36,371 --> 00:23:39,101
I thought it said arts.

259
00:23:39,207 --> 00:23:44,042
I imagined my father with an easel
painting in Paradise.

260
00:23:45,814 --> 00:23:48,783
I believe I've said something funny.

261
00:23:49,317 --> 00:23:53,583
At least, amusing.
You might try to smile.

262
00:24:02,230 --> 00:24:05,825
Will anyone present
scratch my back?

263
00:24:05,934 --> 00:24:08,300
The Lord scratches
those who scratch themselves.

264
00:24:10,138 --> 00:24:12,572
The Lord scratches those...

265
00:24:16,878 --> 00:24:19,073
You two taught me how to laugh.

266
00:24:19,180 --> 00:24:20,909
Before, I always looked glum.

267
00:24:27,822 --> 00:24:30,916
But that's all over.

268
00:24:41,035 --> 00:24:44,334
It's raining. Come and see.

269
00:24:48,443 --> 00:24:51,173
I miss Paris.
Let's go back, please.

270
00:24:51,279 --> 00:24:53,406
We'll be there tomorrow night.

271
00:25:16,571 --> 00:25:18,732
I've sold my book.

272
00:25:19,607 --> 00:25:21,700
This is for Catherine.

273
00:25:22,277 --> 00:25:23,642
This is for both of you.

274
00:25:27,015 --> 00:25:30,781
- What is it?
- A back-scratcher.

275
00:25:39,060 --> 00:25:41,927
I'm taking you
to the theater tonight.

276
00:25:43,665 --> 00:25:47,897
- What will we see?
- A new Swedish play.

277
00:25:49,737 --> 00:25:51,034
It starts at nine.

278
00:25:51,139 --> 00:25:54,302
When the sand stops,
we'll get dressed.

279
00:25:56,811 --> 00:25:59,405
<i>Jim saw his friends often.</i>

280
00:25:59,514 --> 00:26:01,948
<i>He liked to be with them.</i>

281
00:26:02,050 --> 00:26:06,077
<i>Jules' two pillows</i>
<i>were now side by side.</i>

282
00:26:06,187 --> 00:26:08,621
<i>Catherine learned to live again.</i>

283
00:26:21,469 --> 00:26:23,437
I still like that girl.

284
00:26:23,972 --> 00:26:27,874
She wants to be free.
She invents her own life.

285
00:26:27,976 --> 00:26:30,342
- Doesn't Jim agree?
- No.

286
00:26:31,312 --> 00:26:32,779
It's a confused
and self-indulging play.

287
00:26:32,880 --> 00:26:35,508
The writer revels in vice
to preach virtue.

288
00:26:35,616 --> 00:26:38,847
We don't even know
when or where it's taking place.

289
00:26:38,953 --> 00:26:41,945
He doesn't say
if the heroine is a virgin.

290
00:26:42,590 --> 00:26:44,114
That's not important.

291
00:26:44,225 --> 00:26:48,889
Usually not, but since he explains
that the hero is impotent...

292
00:26:48,997 --> 00:26:51,329
that his brother is gay
and that the sister is a nymphomaniac...

293
00:26:51,432 --> 00:26:53,900
why should he dismiss the heroine?

294
00:26:54,002 --> 00:26:55,936
That's all in your mind.

295
00:26:56,037 --> 00:26:58,562
Yes, and you help us think of it.

296
00:26:59,374 --> 00:27:01,137
No psychology tonight.

297
00:27:01,242 --> 00:27:04,040
It's not psychology,
it's metaphysics.

298
00:27:04,145 --> 00:27:07,581
In a couple,
the wife must be faithful.

299
00:27:07,682 --> 00:27:10,048
The husband doesn't count.

300
00:27:10,151 --> 00:27:14,383
Who wrote: "Woman is natural,
therefore abominable?"

301
00:27:14,489 --> 00:27:17,458
Baudelaire. But he meant
a certain class.

302
00:27:17,558 --> 00:27:20,925
Not at all.
He meant women in general.

303
00:27:21,029 --> 00:27:23,224
Here's how he describes
a young girl:

304
00:27:23,331 --> 00:27:28,098
"Monster, assassin of the arts.
Little fool, little slut.

305
00:27:28,202 --> 00:27:31,729
A blend of idiocy and depravity."

306
00:27:31,839 --> 00:27:35,036
Wait, that's not all.
This is marvelous:

307
00:27:35,143 --> 00:27:39,512
"I wonder why women are
allowed to enter churches.

308
00:27:40,048 --> 00:27:43,779
What could they hope
to say to God?"

309
00:27:45,219 --> 00:27:47,483
- You're a pair of fools.
- I haven't said anything.

310
00:27:47,588 --> 00:27:51,149
And I don't approve
of what Jules says at 2 in the morning.

311
00:27:53,127 --> 00:27:55,527
- Then protest!
- I am protesting.

312
00:28:04,572 --> 00:28:06,506
<i>Jim never forgot that jump.</i>

313
00:28:06,607 --> 00:28:09,872
<i>He drew it the next day,</i>
<i>though he was not an artist.</i>

314
00:28:09,977 --> 00:28:13,037
<i>His admiration for Catherine</i>
<i>struck him like lightning...</i>

315
00:28:13,147 --> 00:28:15,115
<i>as he blew her an invisible kiss.</i>

316
00:28:15,216 --> 00:28:16,183
<i>He didn't worry.</i>

317
00:28:16,284 --> 00:28:19,947
<i>He was swimming with her mentally,</i>
<i>and held his breath to frighten Jules.</i>

318
00:28:21,055 --> 00:28:22,249
Catherine, why?

319
00:28:26,294 --> 00:28:27,454
You're crazy.

320
00:28:39,474 --> 00:28:41,669
<i>Her hat drifted away.</i>

321
00:28:51,953 --> 00:28:54,945
<i>Jules was pale, silent, unsure of himself,</i>
<i>and more handsome.</i>

322
00:28:55,056 --> 00:28:59,686
<i>Catherine had a triumphant smile.</i>

323
00:28:59,794 --> 00:29:01,318
<i>No one spoke about her jump.</i>

324
00:29:03,965 --> 00:29:07,196
- I've arrived.
- Please, Mr. Jim.

325
00:29:07,301 --> 00:29:10,464
- No, just Jim.
- Just Jim.

326
00:29:11,139 --> 00:29:14,631
I want to ask you some advice.

327
00:29:15,176 --> 00:29:18,805
Can you meet me tomorrow
at 7 in our café?

328
00:29:18,913 --> 00:29:20,005
Yes.

329
00:29:20,114 --> 00:29:24,380
- She wants to talk to you.
- Right, I'll be there at 7.

330
00:29:44,305 --> 00:29:46,773
- Are you joking?
- I never joke.

331
00:29:46,874 --> 00:29:49,138
I've no sense of humor.

332
00:29:50,978 --> 00:29:55,039
I know people who have.
My wife's friends, working relations.

333
00:29:55,149 --> 00:29:57,913
But personally, I never joke.

334
00:30:00,788 --> 00:30:03,985
<i>Jim was late, as usual,</i>
<i>because he was an optimist.</i>

335
00:30:04,091 --> 00:30:07,185
<i>He was afraid she had already left.</i>

336
00:30:07,828 --> 00:30:10,661
<i>Jim thought: "A girl like that...</i>

337
00:30:10,765 --> 00:30:13,393
<i>would probably not have waited.</i>

338
00:30:13,501 --> 00:30:15,594
<i>A girl like that</i>
<i>might have just walked in...</i>

339
00:30:15,703 --> 00:30:18,831
<i>without noticing me</i>
<i>behind my newspaper, and left. "</i>

340
00:30:18,940 --> 00:30:21,841
<i>He kept repeating:</i>
<i>"A girl like that."</i>

341
00:30:21,943 --> 00:30:23,604
<i>But what was she like?</i>

342
00:30:23,711 --> 00:30:26,874
<i>For the first time,</i>
<i>he began to think of her.</i>

343
00:30:31,052 --> 00:30:33,020
Another coffee, please.

344
00:30:35,122 --> 00:30:38,057
Another glass.

345
00:31:27,275 --> 00:31:29,869
Did I wake you up, Jim?

346
00:31:29,977 --> 00:31:33,435
We're going to my country,
to get married.

347
00:31:34,949 --> 00:31:39,909
Tell her I'm sorry I was late.
I waited almost till 8.

348
00:31:40,021 --> 00:31:42,455
She's more optimistic than you.

349
00:31:42,556 --> 00:31:45,525
She was at the hairdresser...

350
00:31:45,626 --> 00:31:47,992
<i>and arrived at 8</i>
<i>to have dinner with you.</i>

351
00:31:48,095 --> 00:31:51,462
If I had known she'd come,
I could have waited until midnight.

352
00:31:51,565 --> 00:31:55,399
<i>Catherine wants to speak to you.</i>

353
00:31:56,537 --> 00:31:59,404
I'm very happy, Jim.

354
00:31:59,507 --> 00:32:02,101
Jules will teach me French boxing.

355
00:32:02,209 --> 00:32:04,939
<i>With an Austrian accent.</i>

356
00:32:05,046 --> 00:32:09,244
I've lost my accent!
My French is perfect!

357
00:32:09,350 --> 00:32:10,942
Listen to the Marseillaise.

358
00:32:45,453 --> 00:32:47,284
<i>A few days later,
war was declared.</i>

359
00:32:47,388 --> 00:32:50,323
<i>Jules and Jim were separated</i>
<i>by their uniforms...</i>

360
00:32:50,424 --> 00:32:52,119
<i>and lost touch for a long time.</i>

361
00:33:54,989 --> 00:33:57,116
<i>The war was never ending.</i>

362
00:33:57,224 --> 00:33:59,556
<i>Gradually, it became</i>
<i>like a normal life...</i>

363
00:33:59,660 --> 00:34:01,651
<i>tempered by the different seasons.</i>

364
00:34:01,762 --> 00:34:05,960
<i>A normal life with dead beats, routines,</i>
<i>pauses, and even distractions.</i>

365
00:34:16,577 --> 00:34:18,875
<i>Gilberte sent parcels to Jim.</i>

366
00:34:18,979 --> 00:34:22,710
<i>He almost saw her a few times,</i>
<i>but each time his leave was canceled.</i>

367
00:34:24,485 --> 00:34:27,613
<i>Then, in 1916,</i>
<i>he spent a week in Paris.</i>

368
00:34:28,989 --> 00:34:33,392
Don't marry me for my parcels.
We're fine as we are.

369
00:34:33,494 --> 00:34:36,429
All right,
but I know this will last.

370
00:34:36,530 --> 00:34:40,591
- How is Jules?
- No news of him since his wedding.

371
00:34:40,701 --> 00:34:43,693
Sometimes, I'm afraid
I'll kill Jules during a battle.

372
00:34:55,082 --> 00:34:56,447
<i>My darling...</i>

373
00:34:57,485 --> 00:34:59,510
<i>I never stop thinking of you.</i>

374
00:35:00,120 --> 00:35:03,055
<i>Not of your soul.</i>
<i>I don't believe in it anymore.</i>

375
00:35:03,724 --> 00:35:06,887
<i>But of your body...</i>

376
00:35:07,628 --> 00:35:10,927
<i>and our son who is inside you.</i>

377
00:35:12,333 --> 00:35:16,235
<i>I've no more envelopes.</i>
<i>I don't know how to mail this letter.</i>

378
00:35:17,671 --> 00:35:20,105
<i>I am going to the Russian front.</i>

379
00:35:21,242 --> 00:35:23,210
<i>It will be tough...</i>

380
00:35:24,411 --> 00:35:28,871
<i>but I prefer it because</i>
<i>I was afraid to kill Jim here.</i>

381
00:35:30,284 --> 00:35:31,615
<i>My darling...</i>

382
00:35:33,320 --> 00:35:35,652
<i>let me kiss you.</i>

383
00:36:34,582 --> 00:36:37,710
<i>Jules' country lost the war.</i>
<i>Jim's had won.</i>

384
00:36:37,818 --> 00:36:40,309
<i>But they were both victorious</i>
<i>since they were alive.</i>

385
00:36:40,421 --> 00:36:44,551
<i>They began to write each other again.</i>

386
00:36:44,658 --> 00:36:47,286
<i>Catherine and Jules lived</i>
<i>in a cottage near the Rhine.</i>

387
00:36:47,394 --> 00:36:49,794
<i>They had a daughter, Sabine.</i>

388
00:36:49,897 --> 00:36:54,857
<i>Jim wrote Jules: " Tell me,</i>
<i>should I marry and have children, too?"</i>

389
00:36:54,969 --> 00:36:58,063
<i>Jules replied:</i>
<i>"Come and judge for yourself."</i>

390
00:36:58,172 --> 00:37:00,072
<i>Catherine signed the invitation.</i>

391
00:37:00,174 --> 00:37:03,769
<i>Jim left,</i>
<i>but he delayed his arrival.</i>

392
00:37:03,877 --> 00:37:06,311
<i>He walked along the Rhine,</i>
<i>and stopped in several towns.</i>

393
00:37:06,413 --> 00:37:10,247
<i>He was writing about Germany</i>
<i>after the war for a Paris paper.</i>

394
00:37:11,719 --> 00:37:14,552
<i>He wanted to see</i>
<i>his battlegrounds again.</i>

395
00:37:16,991 --> 00:37:19,255
<i>In some places, the land</i>
<i>had been bombarded so heavily...</i>

396
00:37:19,360 --> 00:37:23,626
<i>that nothing could ever</i>
<i>grow on it again.</i>

397
00:37:24,098 --> 00:37:28,660
<i>They became cemeteries where Jim</i>
<i>looked on graves for familiar names...</i>

398
00:37:28,769 --> 00:37:32,000
<i>cemeteries that were being shown</i>
<i>to schoolchildren.</i>

399
00:37:47,721 --> 00:37:50,383
<i>Catherine was waiting at the</i>
<i>station with her daughter.</i>

400
00:37:50,491 --> 00:37:53,426
<i>Her eyes were shining with joy.</i>

401
00:38:05,239 --> 00:38:07,104
- Hello, Jim.
- Hello, Catherine.

402
00:38:07,207 --> 00:38:11,234
- This is Sabine.
- Hello, Mr. Jim.

403
00:38:12,746 --> 00:38:14,373
Let's go.
Jules is anxious to see you.

404
00:38:15,282 --> 00:38:19,013
<i>Her deep voice made Jim think</i>
<i>she had finally made their date...</i>

405
00:38:19,119 --> 00:38:21,087
<i>and had dressed up</i>
<i>especially for him.</i>

406
00:38:21,188 --> 00:38:25,215
<i>She took him to their cottage,</i>
<i>surrounded by pines and near a hill.</i>

407
00:38:55,923 --> 00:38:58,517
- How are the others?
- Oh, the others, you know.

408
00:39:05,566 --> 00:39:07,761
- You haven't changed, Jim.
- You haven't changed, Jules.

409
00:39:07,868 --> 00:39:09,563
So, no one has changed.

410
00:39:23,617 --> 00:39:24,641
Sit down.

411
00:39:27,054 --> 00:39:28,078
Come here, Sabine.

412
00:39:47,407 --> 00:39:48,374
No, thanks.

413
00:39:49,042 --> 00:39:51,135
- You want some?
- Just a little.

414
00:39:56,717 --> 00:40:00,744
No, thanks. I stopped smoking
when I started to love plants.

415
00:40:09,096 --> 00:40:11,394
An angel is passing by.

416
00:40:17,271 --> 00:40:19,239
Of course, it's twenty past one.

417
00:40:21,441 --> 00:40:22,601
So?

418
00:40:22,709 --> 00:40:25,473
Angels always pass by
at twenty past.

419
00:40:28,315 --> 00:40:31,910
- I didn't know that.
- Neither did I.

420
00:40:38,959 --> 00:40:40,984
At twenty past
and twenty to as well.

421
00:40:44,631 --> 00:40:48,727
So you won the war, you louse.

422
00:40:48,836 --> 00:40:51,566
I'd rather have won this.

423
00:40:55,209 --> 00:40:57,700
You must be hungry. Let's eat.

424
00:40:59,313 --> 00:41:01,873
Afterwards, I'll show you the house.

425
00:41:06,920 --> 00:41:10,913
Jim here, Jules over there.
And Sabine next to me.

426
00:41:15,162 --> 00:41:16,857
How is your new novel?

427
00:41:16,964 --> 00:41:19,797
These articles won't let me finish it.

428
00:41:19,900 --> 00:41:24,030
I work on them all week,
write them Friday night...

429
00:41:24,137 --> 00:41:26,935
and send them airmail
the next day. And you?

430
00:41:27,040 --> 00:41:29,941
I am doing a book on dragonflies.

431
00:41:30,043 --> 00:41:32,375
I am writing it for a publisher.

432
00:41:32,479 --> 00:41:35,209
Catherine is illustrating it.

433
00:41:35,315 --> 00:41:40,275
Even Sabine helps.
She goes with me into the swamps.

434
00:41:40,621 --> 00:41:44,614
I'm going to build
a pond in the garden.

435
00:41:44,725 --> 00:41:49,662
One day, perhaps, I may become literary
and write a love story...

436
00:41:49,763 --> 00:41:53,358
with insects as characters.

437
00:41:54,234 --> 00:41:58,830
I have a bad tendency to specialize.

438
00:41:59,539 --> 00:42:02,997
I admire your versatility, Jim.

439
00:42:04,077 --> 00:42:08,275
Oh, me, I'm a failure. Sorel,
my teacher, taught me all I know.

440
00:42:08,649 --> 00:42:11,379
"What do you want to do," he asked me.
I said I wanted to be a diplomat.

441
00:42:11,485 --> 00:42:13,578
"Do you have money?"
"No."

442
00:42:13,687 --> 00:42:18,590
"Are you related to anyone famous?"
"No."

443
00:42:18,692 --> 00:42:22,594
"Then forget about diplomacy!"
"But what can I become?"

444
00:42:22,696 --> 00:42:24,561
"Curious."
"That's no career."

445
00:42:24,665 --> 00:42:26,326
"Not yet.

446
00:42:27,668 --> 00:42:29,693
Travel, write, translate.

447
00:42:29,803 --> 00:42:33,034
Learn to live anywhere,
beginning now.

448
00:42:33,140 --> 00:42:35,165
There's a future in it.

449
00:42:35,275 --> 00:42:38,210
The French have ignored the world
for too long.

450
00:42:39,012 --> 00:42:41,480
A paper will always
pay for your fun."

451
00:42:44,284 --> 00:42:46,980
Jules thinks you have
a bright future.

452
00:42:47,087 --> 00:42:50,989
So do I,
but it may not be spectacular.

453
00:42:53,493 --> 00:42:56,155
<i>Jules works and sleeps here.</i>

454
00:42:56,263 --> 00:42:59,198
<i>We're as organized as a monastery.</i>

455
00:42:59,333 --> 00:43:01,130
<i>Jules writes his books...</i>

456
00:43:01,234 --> 00:43:04,692
<i>and hunts his insects.</i>

457
00:43:04,805 --> 00:43:08,070
<i>Mathilde, who you saw,</i>
<i>comes from a nearby farm.</i>

458
00:43:08,175 --> 00:43:10,973
<i>She helps me</i>
<i>with the house and Sabine.</i>

459
00:43:13,780 --> 00:43:14,747
My room.

460
00:43:19,586 --> 00:43:20,712
That's Jules!

461
00:43:20,821 --> 00:43:25,588
Yes, his father liked Mozart so much
that he once disguised him as Mozart.

462
00:43:27,894 --> 00:43:29,452
Here is the balcony.

463
00:43:35,569 --> 00:43:37,969
Over there is the inn
where you'll sleep.

464
00:43:38,071 --> 00:43:40,039
Jules will take you there later.

465
00:44:53,530 --> 00:44:55,964
<i>Jules and Jim</i>
<i>carried on their conversation.</i>

466
00:44:56,066 --> 00:44:59,467
<i>They talked about the war.</i>
<i>Jules avoided talking about his family.</i>

467
00:44:59,570 --> 00:45:01,663
<i>Catherine was kind and tough...</i>

468
00:45:01,772 --> 00:45:04,400
<i>but Jim felt something was wrong.</i>

469
00:45:13,784 --> 00:45:16,878
To bed, sleepyhead.

470
00:45:16,987 --> 00:45:19,512
Once upon a time...

471
00:45:20,290 --> 00:45:22,190
there was a little sleepyhead...

472
00:45:24,761 --> 00:45:28,288
- Good night, Sabine.
- Good night, Jim. See you tomorrow.

473
00:45:31,268 --> 00:45:33,600
- Good night, Jules.
- I want to talk to you.

474
00:45:38,742 --> 00:45:42,769
- What do you think of her?
- Marriage and motherhood suit her.

475
00:45:42,879 --> 00:45:46,007
She's less of a grasshopper
and more of an ant.

476
00:45:50,020 --> 00:45:51,009
Be careful.

477
00:45:51,788 --> 00:45:54,655
True, she keeps order in our home.

478
00:45:55,192 --> 00:45:59,185
But if things go too smoothly,
she changes.

479
00:45:59,763 --> 00:46:03,062
She becomes a tyrant in her words.

480
00:46:03,166 --> 00:46:05,464
Yes, she has a Napoleonic side.

481
00:46:06,403 --> 00:46:08,894
She believes the world is rich...

482
00:46:09,006 --> 00:46:12,339
and that one can cheat a little.

483
00:46:12,442 --> 00:46:15,138
She begs God
to forgive her in advance.

484
00:46:15,245 --> 00:46:16,507
She is sure that He will.

485
00:46:18,682 --> 00:46:21,116
I'm afraid she'll leave us.

486
00:46:22,285 --> 00:46:25,777
- Impossible!
- No, she has done it already.

487
00:46:26,356 --> 00:46:29,587
It lasted 6 months.
I gave up hope.

488
00:46:29,693 --> 00:46:31,957
She's ready to do it again.

489
00:46:33,230 --> 00:46:35,562
She's not really my wife, Jim.

490
00:46:35,666 --> 00:46:38,100
She has had three lovers.

491
00:46:38,201 --> 00:46:42,638
One was a fling the day before
our wedding, to bury her youth.

492
00:46:42,739 --> 00:46:45,469
And one as revenge
for something I did.

493
00:46:45,575 --> 00:46:47,042
I don't know what.

494
00:46:49,446 --> 00:46:51,437
I'm not the man she needs...

495
00:46:51,548 --> 00:46:53,846
and she won't accept that.

496
00:46:54,618 --> 00:46:58,315
I'm used to her
being unfaithful to me at times...

497
00:46:59,089 --> 00:47:01,580
but I couldn't stand to see her go.

498
00:47:03,060 --> 00:47:07,156
- But there's Albert.
- The singer who found the statue?

499
00:47:07,264 --> 00:47:10,722
Yes, it was he who showed it to us.

500
00:47:10,834 --> 00:47:12,358
He was wounded in the war.

501
00:47:12,469 --> 00:47:15,495
He's convalescing
in a village near here.

502
00:47:16,039 --> 00:47:19,372
Catherine encourages him
and gives him hope.

503
00:47:20,210 --> 00:47:23,543
He has spoken about her to me.

504
00:47:23,647 --> 00:47:26,241
He wants to marry her
and take the child.

505
00:47:27,384 --> 00:47:29,682
I hold no grudge against him.

506
00:47:29,786 --> 00:47:32,016
I have nothing against him nor her.

507
00:47:33,223 --> 00:47:35,350
I am slowly renouncing her...

508
00:47:37,094 --> 00:47:39,585
and all I had expected from the world.

509
00:47:40,163 --> 00:47:43,929
That's what she likes about you.
That Buddhist side of yours.

510
00:47:45,068 --> 00:47:47,628
She's usually kind and generous...

511
00:47:48,238 --> 00:47:52,436
but when she thinks
she is not appreciated...

512
00:47:52,542 --> 00:47:56,000
she becomes terrible, and suddenly
goes from one extreme to the other...

513
00:47:56,113 --> 00:47:57,944
with sudden attacks.

514
00:48:00,117 --> 00:48:02,517
Listen to that mole-cricket.

515
00:48:03,153 --> 00:48:05,383
It's like a mole.

516
00:48:07,224 --> 00:48:09,749
<i>Jim could see the cottage</i>
<i>from his bedroom window.</i>

517
00:48:09,860 --> 00:48:13,296
<i>Catherine was there,</i>
<i>a queen ready to flee.</i>

518
00:48:13,396 --> 00:48:15,125
<i>Jim wasn't surprised.</i>

519
00:48:15,232 --> 00:48:18,167
<i>He recalled Jules' mistakes</i>
<i>with other girls.</i>

520
00:48:18,268 --> 00:48:20,600
<i>Catherine, he knew, was precise.</i>

521
00:48:20,704 --> 00:48:23,935
<i>Jim felt sorry for Jules,</i>
<i>but he could not condemn her.</i>

522
00:48:24,040 --> 00:48:26,907
<i>She jumped at men the way</i>
<i>she had jumped into the river.</i>

523
00:48:27,010 --> 00:48:29,103
<i>The house was under a cloud.</i>

524
00:48:30,313 --> 00:48:32,281
<i>Another week began.</i>

525
00:48:39,322 --> 00:48:44,055
- Time to go to bed, Sabine.
- Okay, Mommy.

526
00:49:06,416 --> 00:49:10,182
I need to speak to you later, Jim.
Will you be free?

527
00:49:18,228 --> 00:49:23,165
Words change meaning
from one language to another...

528
00:49:23,266 --> 00:49:24,858
when they change gender.

529
00:49:24,968 --> 00:49:29,928
In German, war and death are masculine,
unlike in French...

530
00:49:30,373 --> 00:49:34,070
while sun and love are feminine.

531
00:49:39,249 --> 00:49:41,877
- Life is neuter.
- Life is neuter?

532
00:49:41,985 --> 00:49:45,079
Very pretty and very logical.

533
00:49:50,994 --> 00:49:53,963
<i>Skirts became short in France, too,</i>
<i>during the war.</i>

534
00:49:54,064 --> 00:49:56,726
<i>Married soldiers hated that.</i>

535
00:49:56,833 --> 00:49:59,131
They felt betrayed...

536
00:49:59,236 --> 00:50:02,296
but it was because
the fabric was scarce.

537
00:50:02,405 --> 00:50:04,737
Yes, and women
cut their hair short...

538
00:50:04,841 --> 00:50:07,639
to avoid danger in factories.

539
00:50:07,744 --> 00:50:11,976
It's time you start to
appreciate German beer, Jim.

540
00:50:12,082 --> 00:50:15,245
Jim is like me! He's French.
He couldn't care less about German beer.

541
00:50:15,352 --> 00:50:17,217
- Not at all.
- What?

542
00:50:17,320 --> 00:50:20,778
French wines are the best in Europe,
in the world even.

543
00:50:20,891 --> 00:50:25,260
Look at the clarets:
Château Lafite, Château Margaux.

544
00:50:29,266 --> 00:50:32,030
That's not all. There are others.

545
00:50:32,135 --> 00:50:35,002
The burgundies: Romane, Chambertin...

546
00:50:35,105 --> 00:50:37,699
Beaume, Pommard, Chablis, Volnais.

547
00:50:37,807 --> 00:50:40,799
And Beaujolais wines:
Pouilly-Fuissé...

548
00:50:40,911 --> 00:50:44,108
Moulin à Vent, Fleurie,
Morgon, Saint Amour.

549
00:50:44,214 --> 00:50:48,810
We stared at the shell
as it rolled down the steps.

550
00:50:48,919 --> 00:50:52,116
Three steps, two steps.
Lie down.

551
00:50:52,856 --> 00:50:53,845
Catch me.

552
00:51:19,916 --> 00:51:23,147
- What do you want to know?
- Nothing. I want to listen.

553
00:51:23,253 --> 00:51:26,279
- To judge me?
- Certainly not.

554
00:51:29,192 --> 00:51:32,684
I have nothing to tell you.
I want to question you.

555
00:51:33,563 --> 00:51:36,361
The question is:
tell me about Jim.

556
00:51:37,534 --> 00:51:42,301
- Okay, but tell you what?
- Anything, but tell me point-blank.

557
00:51:42,839 --> 00:51:45,034
<i>Jim told of two young men</i>
<i>which he didn't name...</i>

558
00:51:45,141 --> 00:51:48,599
<i>and told the story</i>
<i>of their friendship in Paris...</i>

559
00:51:48,712 --> 00:51:52,478
<i>and how they met a certain girl.</i>

560
00:51:52,582 --> 00:51:57,349
<i>He told of... Not that one, Jim.</i>
<i>There, he had to say his own name.</i>

561
00:51:57,454 --> 00:52:00,116
<i>He told of their friendship,</i>
<i>of their trip by the sea.</i>

562
00:52:00,223 --> 00:52:03,750
<i>Catherine saw that Jim</i>
<i>remembered everything about her.</i>

563
00:52:03,860 --> 00:52:06,693
<i>She argued on a few points</i>
<i>and added other details.</i>

564
00:52:06,796 --> 00:52:10,823
<i>He described their date, told her</i>
<i>how he perceived all three of them.</i>

565
00:52:10,934 --> 00:52:15,894
<i>He said he always knew that</i>
<i>Jules could never keep Catherine.</i>

566
00:52:16,806 --> 00:52:19,900
- You'd have said that in the café?
- Yes.

567
00:52:20,744 --> 00:52:23,713
- Go on.
- That's all there is.

568
00:52:24,447 --> 00:52:25,846
There was the war...

569
00:52:26,750 --> 00:52:29,583
my joy to see Jules again,
my seeing you at the station...

570
00:52:29,686 --> 00:52:31,984
the happy days
I've spent with you here...

571
00:52:32,856 --> 00:52:35,689
what I have seen, what I have learned,
what I have guessed...

572
00:52:35,792 --> 00:52:39,228
that pending cloud, I mean Albert.

573
00:52:39,329 --> 00:52:43,265
- Are you against me?
- No more than Jules is.

574
00:52:44,134 --> 00:52:47,501
Let me tell
my side of the story now.

575
00:52:47,604 --> 00:52:51,301
Jules conquered me
with his generosity...

576
00:52:51,408 --> 00:52:54,138
his innocence, and his vulnerability.

577
00:52:54,244 --> 00:52:56,712
He was such a contrast to other men.

578
00:52:57,580 --> 00:53:00,777
I hoped to cure him
of his insecurities...

579
00:53:00,884 --> 00:53:03,751
but I learned
they were part of him.

580
00:53:04,354 --> 00:53:08,017
We were happy,
but our happiness did not last...

581
00:53:08,124 --> 00:53:13,084
and we became two people, not one.

582
00:53:14,898 --> 00:53:18,129
His family was torture for me.

583
00:53:18,234 --> 00:53:20,668
At a reception before our wedding...

584
00:53:21,237 --> 00:53:24,297
Jules' mother
offended me very deeply.

585
00:53:24,407 --> 00:53:26,466
Jules said nothing.

586
00:53:26,576 --> 00:53:31,536
I punished him by spending a few hours
with an old lover, Harold.

587
00:53:31,815 --> 00:53:33,476
Yes, a lover.

588
00:53:33,583 --> 00:53:38,077
So I was able to marry Jules
with all accounts squared.

589
00:53:39,289 --> 00:53:42,281
Luckily, his family moved away.

590
00:53:42,992 --> 00:53:46,484
The war broke out.
Jules went to the Russian front.

591
00:53:47,330 --> 00:53:51,198
He wrote me love letters,
wonderful letters.

592
00:53:51,868 --> 00:53:54,860
I loved him more at a distance.
He became a saint again.

593
00:53:54,971 --> 00:53:58,566
Things really went wrong
during his first leave.

594
00:53:58,675 --> 00:54:01,200
I felt as if I was
in the arms of a stranger.

595
00:54:01,311 --> 00:54:04,212
He left: Sabine was born
nine months later.

596
00:54:04,314 --> 00:54:05,804
She doesn't look very much like Jules.

597
00:54:05,915 --> 00:54:08,179
Believe what you want,
but she's his.

598
00:54:08,284 --> 00:54:11,617
I said, "I've given you a child.
That's enough.

599
00:54:11,721 --> 00:54:15,248
I want my own bedroom.
I want my own freedom."

600
00:54:15,358 --> 00:54:17,826
Remember our friend, Fortunio?

601
00:54:18,661 --> 00:54:21,562
He was free. So was I.

602
00:54:21,664 --> 00:54:25,065
He was a sweet partner.
What a vacation.

603
00:54:25,168 --> 00:54:28,331
But he was too young to be serious.

604
00:54:29,139 --> 00:54:30,936
One day, to my surprise...

605
00:54:31,674 --> 00:54:35,269
I missed Jules and his indulgence.

606
00:54:35,378 --> 00:54:38,438
My daughter attracted me
like a magnet.

607
00:54:38,548 --> 00:54:39,981
I left.

608
00:54:40,583 --> 00:54:42,608
I've been back for three months.

609
00:54:45,155 --> 00:54:48,056
Jules is no longer my husband.

610
00:54:48,158 --> 00:54:52,618
Don't feel sorry for him.
My presence alone satisfies him.

611
00:54:53,930 --> 00:54:55,557
Then there is Albert.

612
00:54:55,665 --> 00:54:59,726
He told me of that statue you loved
which resembles me.

613
00:54:59,836 --> 00:55:01,303
I flirted with him.

614
00:55:01,404 --> 00:55:05,135
He can be strange, but he has
a natural strength that Jules doesn't.

615
00:55:05,241 --> 00:55:09,075
He wants to leave everything,
marry me and take me and my daughter.

616
00:55:09,179 --> 00:55:11,579
So far, I like him. That's all.

617
00:55:11,681 --> 00:55:14,548
He's coming to lunch tomorrow.
I'll see.

618
00:55:14,651 --> 00:55:17,313
I talked more than you did.

619
00:55:17,420 --> 00:55:20,321
I didn't say everything.
Neither did you.

620
00:55:20,423 --> 00:55:22,584
Perhaps I've had other men.
That's my business.

621
00:55:22,692 --> 00:55:25,422
I spoke only of what you mentioned.

622
00:55:25,528 --> 00:55:28,088
- I understand.
- I don't want you to.

623
00:55:28,698 --> 00:55:30,529
It's almost dawn.

624
00:55:31,267 --> 00:55:34,828
<i>Jim desired her,</i>
<i>but he kept repressing that desire.</i>

625
00:55:34,938 --> 00:55:38,806
<i>She had to stay.</i>
<i>Was Jim acting for Jules?</i>

626
00:55:38,908 --> 00:55:41,877
<i>Or for himself?</i>
<i>He would never know.</i>

627
00:55:50,086 --> 00:55:52,520
<i>Perhaps she was seducing him,</i>
<i>although Jim was unsure.</i>

628
00:55:52,622 --> 00:55:57,582
<i>But she revealed her goals</i>
<i>only when she achieved them.</i>

629
00:56:10,006 --> 00:56:11,906
- Hello, Sabine.
- Hello, Albert.

630
00:56:12,008 --> 00:56:15,569
- How are you? How is your mother?
- Fine.

631
00:56:23,686 --> 00:56:25,085
Hello, Albert.

632
00:56:27,257 --> 00:56:30,749
- You sacrificed your moustache?
- Yes, everyone did.

633
00:56:30,860 --> 00:56:33,158
But I don't like it.
Now I feel naked.

634
00:56:33,263 --> 00:56:34,855
I'll let it grow back.

635
00:56:34,964 --> 00:56:37,330
Albert was wounded...

636
00:56:37,433 --> 00:56:38,832
in the trenches.

637
00:56:38,935 --> 00:56:41,165
I'm all right now,
but when I woke up...

638
00:56:41,271 --> 00:56:44,968
and saw the doctors probing inside
my skull, I thought of Oscar Wilde.

639
00:56:45,074 --> 00:56:47,235
God, spare me physical pain.

640
00:56:47,343 --> 00:56:49,573
I'll take care of the moral pain.

641
00:56:49,679 --> 00:56:51,806
What's revolting about war...

642
00:56:51,914 --> 00:56:55,179
is that it deprives man
of his own individual battle.

643
00:56:55,285 --> 00:56:59,779
Yes, but even in the midst of war,
he can fight it.

644
00:56:59,889 --> 00:57:03,381
I knew a soldier in the hospital.

645
00:57:03,493 --> 00:57:06,951
On leave, he met a girl on a train.

646
00:57:07,063 --> 00:57:09,327
They talked between Nice and Marseilles.

647
00:57:09,432 --> 00:57:12,333
She left and gave him her address.

648
00:57:12,435 --> 00:57:16,531
Well, he wrote her every day
for two years from the trenches...

649
00:57:16,639 --> 00:57:18,869
by candlelight, during battles.

650
00:57:18,975 --> 00:57:21,842
His letters became more intimate.

651
00:57:21,944 --> 00:57:26,643
At first, he wrote: "Dear Miss,"
and ended with, "Yours truly."

652
00:57:26,749 --> 00:57:30,310
Soon he called her "My little lamb"
and asked for her picture.

653
00:57:30,420 --> 00:57:33,787
Then she became "My adorable lamb."
First: "I kiss your hand."

654
00:57:33,890 --> 00:57:36,654
Then: "Your forehead."

655
00:57:36,759 --> 00:57:39,523
She sent him a picture...

656
00:57:39,629 --> 00:57:42,689
and he wrote that he could see
her breasts through her robe.

657
00:57:42,799 --> 00:57:46,462
He became more blunt.
"I love you terribly."

658
00:57:46,569 --> 00:57:50,335
He wrote to her mother
and proposed marriage.

659
00:57:50,440 --> 00:57:54,536
He became her fiancé
without having seen her again.

660
00:57:54,644 --> 00:57:58,546
As the war continued,
his letters became more intimate.

661
00:57:58,648 --> 00:58:02,880
"I take you, my love.
I hold your adorable breasts.

662
00:58:02,985 --> 00:58:05,818
I hold you naked against my body."

663
00:58:05,922 --> 00:58:09,949
She wrote a cold letter,
and he begged her to be serious...

664
00:58:10,059 --> 00:58:12,857
for he could die at any time,
and he was right.

665
00:58:12,962 --> 00:58:17,592
This mad affair
by correspondence could exist...

666
00:58:17,700 --> 00:58:20,567
only in the violence
of trench warfare...

667
00:58:20,670 --> 00:58:24,071
with death always nearby.

668
00:58:25,208 --> 00:58:28,177
So this man fought the war...

669
00:58:28,277 --> 00:58:31,769
but he fought
his own battle as well...

670
00:58:31,881 --> 00:58:35,146
and he won a woman by mail.

671
00:58:36,419 --> 00:58:39,388
He had a head wound, too,
when he arrived at the hospital...

672
00:58:39,489 --> 00:58:41,457
but he was less lucky.

673
00:58:41,557 --> 00:58:44,890
He died the day
before the Armistice.

674
00:58:45,995 --> 00:58:48,896
In his last letter, he wrote her...

675
00:58:48,998 --> 00:58:51,967
"Your breasts are
the only bombs I've loved."

676
00:58:52,068 --> 00:58:54,628
I'll show you some photos of him.

677
00:58:54,737 --> 00:58:56,830
If you flip through them quickly,
he seems to be moving.

678
00:58:56,939 --> 00:58:58,429
Pretty story.

679
00:58:58,541 --> 00:59:01,374
Jules wrote me
beautiful letters too.

680
00:59:02,478 --> 00:59:05,106
Hello, Albert.
Have you finished my song?

681
00:59:05,214 --> 00:59:08,115
Let's go upstairs
and work on it together.

682
00:59:31,340 --> 00:59:35,208
A rocking chair
has a rhythm of its own.

683
00:59:36,412 --> 00:59:39,575
- What about the song?
- It's almost ready.

684
00:59:39,682 --> 00:59:42,344
Yes. Let's go.

685
00:59:49,258 --> 00:59:51,556
It's too good for them...

686
00:59:51,661 --> 00:59:53,856
but we've no other audience.

687
00:59:59,068 --> 01:00:02,003
<i>She wore rings on every finger</i>

688
01:00:02,104 --> 01:00:04,698
<i>More bracelets than I can tell</i>

689
01:00:04,807 --> 01:00:07,367
<i>And she was the kind of singer</i>

690
01:00:07,477 --> 01:00:10,275
<i>To put me under a spell</i>

691
01:00:10,379 --> 01:00:13,177
<i>She had eyes, eyes of opal</i>

692
01:00:13,282 --> 01:00:15,648
<i>They fascinated me</i>

693
01:00:15,751 --> 01:00:18,083
<i>Her pale face was an oval</i>

694
01:00:18,187 --> 01:00:20,246
<i>What a fatal femme fatale</i>

695
01:00:23,593 --> 01:00:25,823
<i>We met with a kiss</i>

696
01:00:25,928 --> 01:00:28,192
<i>A hit, then a miss</i>

697
01:00:28,297 --> 01:00:30,527
<i>It wasn't all bliss</i>

698
01:00:30,633 --> 01:00:33,067
<i>And we parted</i>

699
01:00:33,169 --> 01:00:35,501
<i>We went our own ways</i>

700
01:00:35,605 --> 01:00:37,903
<i>In life's whirlpool of days</i>

701
01:00:38,007 --> 01:00:40,373
<i>I saw her again one night</i>

702
01:00:40,476 --> 01:00:42,944
<i>Again she was an enchanted sight</i>

703
01:00:46,215 --> 01:00:48,877
<i>I recognized her after a while</i>

704
01:00:48,985 --> 01:00:51,249
<i>By her mysterious smile</i>

705
01:00:51,354 --> 01:00:53,618
<i>Her face in an oval</i>
<i>Her eyes of opal</i>

706
01:00:53,723 --> 01:00:56,089
<i>Affected me more than ever</i>

707
01:00:56,192 --> 01:00:58,524
<i>I drank as I heard her sing</i>

708
01:00:58,628 --> 01:01:00,926
<i>Alcohol lets time lose its sting</i>

709
01:01:01,030 --> 01:01:03,294
<i>I drank far too much</i>

710
01:01:03,399 --> 01:01:05,890
<i>I awoke to her touch</i>

711
01:01:08,738 --> 01:01:11,400
<i>We met with a kiss</i>

712
01:01:11,507 --> 01:01:13,634
<i>A hit, then a miss</i>

713
01:01:13,743 --> 01:01:15,973
<i>It wasn't all bliss</i>

714
01:01:16,078 --> 01:01:18,444
<i>But we started</i>

715
01:01:18,548 --> 01:01:20,880
<i>We went our own ways</i>

716
01:01:20,983 --> 01:01:23,178
<i>In life's whirlpool of days</i>

717
01:01:23,286 --> 01:01:25,516
<i>Again I saw her one night</i>

718
01:01:25,621 --> 01:01:28,089
<i>Again her smile was a light</i>

719
01:01:31,661 --> 01:01:33,629
<i>When you kiss</i>

720
01:01:33,729 --> 01:01:35,822
<i>Why miss</i>

721
01:01:35,932 --> 01:01:37,923
<i>When you return</i>

722
01:01:38,034 --> 01:01:40,502
<i>Why be stern</i>

723
01:01:40,603 --> 01:01:42,798
<i>Together, we make our ways</i>

724
01:01:42,905 --> 01:01:45,032
<i>In life's whirlpool of days</i>

725
01:01:45,141 --> 01:01:47,371
<i>We go round and round</i>

726
01:01:47,476 --> 01:01:52,175
<i>Together bound</i>
<i>Together bound</i>

727
01:01:59,188 --> 01:02:03,818
<i>Each saw her in his own light.</i>
<i>She couldn't please them all.</i>

728
01:02:03,926 --> 01:02:07,589
<i>Jim could only admire</i>
<i>Catherine alone.</i>

729
01:02:07,697 --> 01:02:10,188
<i>He felt he was in the way.</i>

730
01:02:26,582 --> 01:02:28,482
- Good night.
- Good night.

731
01:02:29,819 --> 01:02:33,983
Our affection is new. We should
let it rest like a newborn baby.

732
01:02:35,124 --> 01:02:38,582
You were in love, Jim.
I can feel that.

733
01:02:38,694 --> 01:02:41,561
- Why didn't you marry her?
- It didn't work out.

734
01:02:41,664 --> 01:02:44,360
- What is she like?
- Quiet and patient.

735
01:02:44,467 --> 01:02:47,595
Gilberte says she'll wait
for me forever.

736
01:02:47,703 --> 01:02:49,671
You still love her,
and she loves you?

737
01:02:51,073 --> 01:02:56,033
- Don't make her suffer.
- I need adventures and risks.

738
01:02:57,413 --> 01:03:00,007
There's been a change too.

739
01:03:03,686 --> 01:03:07,349
I admire you.
I enjoy seeing you.

740
01:03:07,456 --> 01:03:10,721
- I'm afraid I'll forget Jules.
- You must not forget him.

741
01:03:10,826 --> 01:03:12,225
Warn him.

742
01:03:20,603 --> 01:03:22,093
Translate that!

743
01:03:22,204 --> 01:03:26,641
The yearnings of two hearts
create such heavenly pain.

744
01:03:26,742 --> 01:03:29,233
Not bad.

745
01:03:29,345 --> 01:03:33,475
Though you added the heavenly.
Good night.

746
01:03:33,582 --> 01:03:36,278
Give my regards to the others.

747
01:03:36,385 --> 01:03:39,513
I'd like to read Goethe tonight.
May I have it?

748
01:03:39,622 --> 01:03:42,819
- I lent it to Jim.
- Too bad.

749
01:03:43,926 --> 01:03:46,520
- Good night, Jim.
- Good night.

750
01:03:47,630 --> 01:03:49,564
I'll bring it tomorrow.

751
01:04:06,716 --> 01:04:09,241
You must bring it now.

752
01:04:09,351 --> 01:04:11,512
She insists on reading it tonight.

753
01:04:12,788 --> 01:04:15,757
Jim, she doesn't want me anymore.

754
01:04:16,959 --> 01:04:20,395
I'm afraid she will disappear
from my life.

755
01:04:20,496 --> 01:04:23,590
The last time I saw you with her...

756
01:04:23,699 --> 01:04:25,963
you looked like a couple.

757
01:04:26,068 --> 01:04:28,195
Love her, marry her...

758
01:04:28,304 --> 01:04:30,329
and let me see her.

759
01:04:30,439 --> 01:04:33,897
I mean, if you love her,
don't think I'm an obstacle.

760
01:05:48,417 --> 01:05:50,715
<i>Jim had waited for her all day.</i>

761
01:05:50,820 --> 01:05:53,186
<i>She came into his arms gravely.</i>

762
01:05:54,056 --> 01:05:56,581
<i>Their first kiss lasted all night.</i>

763
01:05:56,692 --> 01:05:59,058
<i>They were silent</i>
<i>as they drew close.</i>

764
01:05:59,161 --> 01:06:01,095
<i>Later, they remained silent.</i>

765
01:06:01,197 --> 01:06:04,633
<i>Her face expressed</i>
<i>strange joy and curiosity.</i>

766
01:06:04,733 --> 01:06:06,633
<i>Jim was prisoner.</i>

767
01:06:06,735 --> 01:06:08,965
<i>No other woman existed for him.</i>

768
01:06:13,209 --> 01:06:14,608
Your turn.

769
01:06:35,030 --> 01:06:38,227
I've asked Jim
to move into the house.

770
01:06:38,334 --> 01:06:40,393
He'll take the small room.

771
01:06:45,941 --> 01:06:48,000
Careful, Jim.

772
01:06:48,110 --> 01:06:51,079
Be careful for both of you.

773
01:07:22,311 --> 01:07:24,211
This is your room.

774
01:07:25,314 --> 01:07:29,444
The books are in German,
but I've got others in my room.

775
01:07:31,854 --> 01:07:35,017
I'll unpack your bag.
I think it will do.

776
01:07:36,125 --> 01:07:39,185
The rest is a mess...

777
01:07:39,295 --> 01:07:41,229
but we can't help that.

778
01:07:41,330 --> 01:07:46,063
- What is on the other side?
- Sabine and Mathilde's room.

779
01:07:52,641 --> 01:07:55,007
The bed isn't too bad.

780
01:07:55,110 --> 01:07:57,305
Sit down next to me.

781
01:08:01,951 --> 01:08:04,181
I've always liked
the nape of your neck.

782
01:08:04,286 --> 01:08:07,949
That was the only part of you
I could look at without being seen.

783
01:08:35,651 --> 01:08:37,414
What about Jules?

784
01:08:37,519 --> 01:08:39,487
He loves us both.

785
01:08:39,588 --> 01:08:43,786
This won't surprise him.
He won't suffer.

786
01:08:43,892 --> 01:08:46,884
We shall love him and respect him.

787
01:08:49,865 --> 01:08:53,392
<i>In the village they were</i>
<i>known as the three lunatics...</i>

788
01:08:53,502 --> 01:08:55,436
<i>but they were accepted.</i>

789
01:08:55,537 --> 01:08:58,597
<i>When she found that out, Catherine</i>
<i>invented a game: the village idiot.</i>

790
01:08:58,707 --> 01:09:02,040
<i>The village was the table.</i>
<i>They took turns as the idiot.</i>

791
01:09:02,144 --> 01:09:04,612
<i>Sabine made them laugh.</i>

792
01:09:36,979 --> 01:09:40,210
<i>Catherine believed</i>
<i>that love was short...</i>

793
01:09:40,315 --> 01:09:42,875
<i>but constantly recurring.</i>

794
01:09:42,985 --> 01:09:45,044
<i>Life was a vacation</i>
<i>for all of them.</i>

795
01:09:45,154 --> 01:09:48,521
<i>Jules and Jim</i>
<i>had never lived so intensely.</i>

796
01:09:48,624 --> 01:09:50,592
<i>Time went by.</i>

797
01:09:50,692 --> 01:09:53,752
<i>Happiness can't be told,</i>
<i>but it wears off without anyone noticing it.</i>

798
01:09:55,531 --> 01:09:57,931
<i>One day, she decided</i>
<i>to seduce Jules.</i>

799
01:09:58,033 --> 01:10:00,024
<i>While Jim was reading downstairs...</i>

800
01:10:00,135 --> 01:10:02,365
<i>she took Jules into her room.</i>

801
01:10:02,471 --> 01:10:05,702
<i>Jules said no,</i>
<i>but Catherine said yes.</i>

802
01:10:32,534 --> 01:10:36,800
<i>Jim said he wasn't jealous,</i>
<i>but he was.</i>

803
01:10:36,905 --> 01:10:40,705
<i>She saw this and never</i>
<i>repeated the experiment.</i>

804
01:10:42,177 --> 01:10:44,407
<i>One day,
they walked around a lake...</i>

805
01:10:44,513 --> 01:10:47,710
<i>hidden in the mist of a green valley.</i>

806
01:10:47,816 --> 01:10:49,875
<i>The harmony between them was perfect.</i>

807
01:10:49,985 --> 01:10:53,751
<i>Catherine had a headache,</i>
<i>so did Jim.</i>

808
01:10:53,856 --> 01:10:56,984
<i>If they had children, he thought,</i>
<i>they would be tall...</i>

809
01:10:57,092 --> 01:10:59,458
<i>thin and have headaches too.</i>

810
01:10:59,561 --> 01:11:01,961
<i>They played on the shore</i>
<i>of the lake.</i>

811
01:11:02,064 --> 01:11:06,228
<i>She made him throw stones.</i>
<i>She and Jules learned how to skip stones.</i>

812
01:11:07,336 --> 01:11:09,327
<i>The sky was so close to them.</i>

813
01:11:20,582 --> 01:11:23,016
<i>Jim had to return to Paris.</i>

814
01:11:23,118 --> 01:11:25,018
<i>His paper needed him.</i>

815
01:11:25,120 --> 01:11:28,556
<i>But they knew he would return...</i>

816
01:11:28,657 --> 01:11:30,557
<i>and things would remain the same.</i>

817
01:11:30,659 --> 01:11:34,652
<i>Their perfect month</i>
<i>was engraved into them.</i>

818
01:11:36,298 --> 01:11:39,131
<i>They waved at each other as he left.</i>

819
01:11:39,234 --> 01:11:43,762
<i>Jules gave them his blessings</i>
<i>and promised to take care of her...</i>

820
01:11:43,872 --> 01:11:46,363
<i>for they wanted to marry.</i>

821
01:11:54,983 --> 01:11:57,543
Jules is willing to divorce.

822
01:11:57,653 --> 01:12:00,019
I'm going to marry Catherine.

823
01:12:00,122 --> 01:12:02,682
I want to have children with her.

824
01:12:02,791 --> 01:12:05,419
Jules will find me work
in his country.

825
01:12:05,527 --> 01:12:09,657
Right now, I'm translating
an Austrian play.

826
01:12:11,967 --> 01:12:13,867
Where are you going?

827
01:12:13,969 --> 01:12:15,903
- Home.
- I'll go with you.

828
01:12:16,004 --> 01:12:18,529
I'd rather you didn't.

829
01:12:23,712 --> 01:12:25,646
Hello, Jim.

830
01:12:25,747 --> 01:12:29,080
It's me, Therese.
The steam engine.

831
01:12:29,184 --> 01:12:31,778
Therese, how are you?
How is...

832
01:12:31,887 --> 01:12:34,447
It lasted two weeks.
I cheated on him.

833
01:12:34,556 --> 01:12:37,719
He found out, got jealous,
stopped trusting me.

834
01:12:37,826 --> 01:12:40,317
He locked me up for three weeks.

835
01:12:40,429 --> 01:12:42,863
I was flattered, then furious.

836
01:12:42,965 --> 01:12:45,263
I got out on a painter's ladder
with the painter.

837
01:12:45,367 --> 01:12:47,927
I got impatient.
A guy wants to make me rich.

838
01:12:48,036 --> 01:12:50,937
I follow him to Cairo
where he puts me up in a house.

839
01:12:54,076 --> 01:12:56,442
An Englishman rescues me.

840
01:12:56,545 --> 01:13:00,242
I move into his villa by the Red Sea,
play tennis, ride horses.

841
01:13:00,349 --> 01:13:02,909
Then I get a letter.

842
01:13:03,018 --> 01:13:05,646
- Hello, is Jules in Paris?
- No, he didn't come.

843
01:13:05,754 --> 01:13:09,588
I go to wreck the wedding.
I marry him.

844
01:13:09,691 --> 01:13:12,683
Hello, Jim. How is your buddy?

845
01:13:12,794 --> 01:13:16,059
- Still with the same girl?
- Always.

846
01:13:16,164 --> 01:13:19,065
He was serious.
He thought I wasn't.

847
01:13:19,167 --> 01:13:21,692
My husband divorced me finally.

848
01:13:21,803 --> 01:13:24,033
My undertaker married me.

849
01:13:24,139 --> 01:13:26,266
It's a perfect marriage,
but no children.

850
01:13:26,375 --> 01:13:30,937
I've neither time nor energy
to be unfaithful.

851
01:13:31,046 --> 01:13:35,176
So I'm writing my memoirs for the
Sunday <i>Times</i> Magazine in Europe.

852
01:13:35,284 --> 01:13:37,514
My husband.

853
01:13:39,921 --> 01:13:42,082
- What about you, Jim?
- I'm getting married.

854
01:13:51,566 --> 01:13:54,501
- How's Jules?
- All right.

855
01:13:56,938 --> 01:14:00,430
Interesting, isn't she?
Her name is Denise.

856
01:14:00,542 --> 01:14:02,942
She won't talk to you.

857
01:14:03,045 --> 01:14:05,912
She never talks.
She's not stupid.

858
01:14:06,014 --> 01:14:09,643
She's empty.
It's all empty in there.

859
01:14:09,751 --> 01:14:12,311
- She's a thing.
- Pretty thing.

860
01:14:12,421 --> 01:14:15,322
Yes, beautiful. It's just sex.

861
01:14:15,424 --> 01:14:17,324
Pure sex.

862
01:14:18,860 --> 01:14:22,125
- Say good-bye, Denise.
- Sir.

863
01:14:26,902 --> 01:14:29,564
<i>Catherine spent the winter at</i>
<i>home in front of the fireplace.</i>

864
01:14:29,671 --> 01:14:32,231
<i>She was Jim's fiancée,</i>
<i>on loan to Jules.</i>

865
01:14:32,341 --> 01:14:34,241
<i>Every day she asked Jules...</i>

866
01:14:34,343 --> 01:14:36,311
<i>"Do you think Jim loves me?"</i>

867
01:14:38,213 --> 01:14:40,613
Listen to me, Gilberte.

868
01:14:40,716 --> 01:14:43,549
If Catherine wants something...

869
01:14:43,652 --> 01:14:46,519
and she thinks
no one will be hurt...

870
01:14:46,621 --> 01:14:49,249
she may be wrong,
but she'll do it...

871
01:14:49,358 --> 01:14:51,826
to learn from the experience.

872
01:14:51,927 --> 01:14:54,760
It's her way of achieving wisdom.

873
01:14:54,863 --> 01:14:56,956
That can last a long time.

874
01:14:57,065 --> 01:14:58,965
Don't be mean.

875
01:15:00,068 --> 01:15:02,696
I'm not mean. I'm jealous.

876
01:15:04,473 --> 01:15:07,340
I knew it would end this way.

877
01:15:09,411 --> 01:15:11,777
Don't leave tomorrow.

878
01:15:11,880 --> 01:15:15,179
You'll give her your life,
so just give me one more week.

879
01:15:16,284 --> 01:15:19,583
<i>Jim couldn't leave Gilberte.</i>
<i>Catherine couldn't leave Jules.</i>

880
01:15:19,688 --> 01:15:22,156
<i>They couldn't hurt</i>
<i>Jules or Gilberte...</i>

881
01:15:22,257 --> 01:15:25,818
<i>who belonged to the past and</i>
<i>who each played the same role.</i>

882
01:15:25,927 --> 01:15:30,159
"Tell Jules I saw Therese.
She's married and is writing.

883
01:15:30,265 --> 01:15:32,460
I have to delay
my trip back once again...

884
01:15:32,567 --> 01:15:35,127
but soon I'll be free,
ready for you.

885
01:15:35,237 --> 01:15:38,229
I must still say a few good-byes.

886
01:15:39,541 --> 01:15:41,771
A few good-byes."

887
01:15:44,780 --> 01:15:46,805
Do you think Jim loves me?

888
01:15:51,119 --> 01:15:54,179
- Hello, Jules.
- Hello.

889
01:15:54,289 --> 01:15:56,086
What's wrong?

890
01:15:56,191 --> 01:15:59,024
Why didn't Catherine
come to meet me?

891
01:15:59,127 --> 01:16:03,291
She disliked your letters. You talked
about your work, your good-byes.

892
01:16:03,398 --> 01:16:06,856
She didn't like your absence.
You were gone too long.

893
01:16:06,968 --> 01:16:09,766
When she is in doubt,
she can do anything.

894
01:16:09,871 --> 01:16:13,568
- Is she waiting for us?
- Yes, I think so.

895
01:16:42,804 --> 01:16:45,204
I didn't want to tell you.

896
01:16:45,307 --> 01:16:48,936
She left yesterday morning
without saying a word.

897
01:16:49,044 --> 01:16:52,673
I had hoped that she would
be back before your arrival.

898
01:16:52,781 --> 01:16:54,772
Aren't you worried?

899
01:16:54,883 --> 01:16:58,114
You mean, is she in danger?

900
01:17:01,690 --> 01:17:05,182
She is merely doing
something irreparable.

901
01:17:06,294 --> 01:17:09,491
I told you,
she disliked your letters.

902
01:17:09,598 --> 01:17:12,089
"Therese is married
and has become a writer.

903
01:17:12,200 --> 01:17:14,168
I must say a few good-byes."

904
01:17:15,337 --> 01:17:19,933
No, Catherine never
does anything halfway.

905
01:17:20,041 --> 01:17:23,977
She's an irresistible force
that can't be stopped.

906
01:17:24,079 --> 01:17:27,048
Her harmony is never
shaken because...

907
01:17:27,148 --> 01:17:29,673
she knows she is always innocent.

908
01:17:29,784 --> 01:17:33,413
- You speak of her as if she was a queen.
- She is a queen.

909
01:17:34,289 --> 01:17:36,484
Let me be frank.

910
01:17:36,591 --> 01:17:40,527
She's not especially beautiful
or intelligent or sincere...

911
01:17:40,629 --> 01:17:42,597
but she is a real woman.

912
01:17:42,697 --> 01:17:44,824
And that is why we love her...

913
01:17:44,933 --> 01:17:47,197
and all men desire her.

914
01:17:49,271 --> 01:17:52,638
Despite this,
why did she make us a gift...

915
01:17:52,741 --> 01:17:54,868
of her presence?

916
01:17:54,976 --> 01:17:58,776
Because we treated her
like a queen.

917
01:17:58,880 --> 01:18:01,849
You know, I almost stayed in Paris.

918
01:18:01,950 --> 01:18:04,748
I knew it could never last.

919
01:18:05,854 --> 01:18:08,846
Even our friendship suffers.

920
01:18:08,957 --> 01:18:11,721
At times, I'm jealous
of your years with her.

921
01:18:11,826 --> 01:18:14,556
And I hate you
for not being jealous of me.

922
01:18:14,663 --> 01:18:16,858
Do you believe that?

923
01:18:16,965 --> 01:18:21,265
I'll do anything
not to lose her completely.

924
01:18:21,369 --> 01:18:23,633
You will, too, when she returns...

925
01:18:23,738 --> 01:18:25,672
for she always returns.

926
01:18:25,774 --> 01:18:29,210
Listen, I'm going back to Paris.

927
01:18:29,311 --> 01:18:32,303
Tell her you didn't see me
at the station.

928
01:18:32,414 --> 01:18:34,712
It's the only solution.

929
01:18:37,185 --> 01:18:41,747
I see. I met the train,
but you weren't on it.

930
01:18:50,699 --> 01:18:54,066
Hello. What's the matter?

931
01:19:00,542 --> 01:19:02,442
You've just arrived.

932
01:19:04,312 --> 01:19:08,009
You're mine and I'm yours.
All is well.

933
01:19:08,116 --> 01:19:10,676
But in your letters,
you said you had things to do.

934
01:19:10,785 --> 01:19:14,312
So did I.
You said good-bye to your loves.

935
01:19:14,422 --> 01:19:17,186
I decided to say good-bye to mine.

936
01:19:17,292 --> 01:19:21,251
You'll hold me in your arms
all night long, but that's all.

937
01:19:21,363 --> 01:19:24,491
We want a child, don't we?

938
01:19:24,599 --> 01:19:28,729
Well, if I had one now,
I wouldn't know if it was yours.

939
01:19:28,837 --> 01:19:30,737
Do you understand?

940
01:19:31,873 --> 01:19:34,967
- I had to do it.
- Do you love Albert?

941
01:19:35,076 --> 01:19:37,544
- No.
- Does he love you?

942
01:19:37,646 --> 01:19:43,380
Yes. You must believe me.
It was your only chance.

943
01:19:43,485 --> 01:19:46,420
Albert equals Gilberte.

944
01:19:46,521 --> 01:19:48,648
You don't say anything?

945
01:19:48,757 --> 01:19:51,089
We must start with a clean slate.

946
01:19:51,192 --> 01:19:55,492
<i>A clean slate and no debts.</i>
<i>That was her creed.</i>

947
01:19:55,597 --> 01:19:58,088
<i>And nothing happened.</i>

948
01:19:58,199 --> 01:20:01,327
<i>She slept,</i>
<i>but Jim's eyes remained open.</i>

949
01:20:01,436 --> 01:20:05,532
<i>He realized that they were</i>
<i>being drawn together.</i>

950
01:20:05,640 --> 01:20:09,201
<i>So they started all over again,</i>
<i>flying high like birds of prey.</i>

951
01:20:09,310 --> 01:20:13,872
<i>They restrained until she was sure</i>
<i>she didn't bear Albert's child.</i>

952
01:20:13,982 --> 01:20:17,748
<i>This restraint exalted them.</i>
<i>They were always together.</i>

953
01:20:17,852 --> 01:20:20,514
<i>They never cheated.</i>
<i>The promised land was in view.</i>

954
01:20:24,459 --> 01:20:26,791
And The Promised Land Faded

955
01:20:26,895 --> 01:20:31,662
<i>They realized that Catherine</i>
<i>was not pregnant with their child.</i>

956
01:20:31,766 --> 01:20:34,462
<i>They saw a specialist who told them</i>
<i>that this was not uncommon...</i>

957
01:20:34,569 --> 01:20:37,060
<i>and that these things took time</i>
<i>with most couples.</i>

958
01:20:44,345 --> 01:20:46,245
What's wrong?

959
01:20:46,347 --> 01:20:48,542
I want to sleep alone tonight.
Go to your room.

960
01:20:48,650 --> 01:20:51,175
- Why?
- I just want to.

961
01:20:51,286 --> 01:20:54,084
- Explain.
- There's nothing to explain.

962
01:20:54,189 --> 01:20:56,714
I'll just stay with you.
That's all.

963
01:20:56,825 --> 01:20:58,759
That's not true.

964
01:20:58,860 --> 01:21:02,261
I don't want you to stay.
I'm disgusted.

965
01:21:02,363 --> 01:21:04,297
It's a nightmare
when the night comes.

966
01:21:04,399 --> 01:21:07,732
When I think of that child we will
never have, I feel I'm taking a test.

967
01:21:07,836 --> 01:21:11,397
- I can't stand it.
- Our love is all that counts.

968
01:21:11,506 --> 01:21:13,974
No, because I count too...

969
01:21:14,075 --> 01:21:16,373
and I love you less.

970
01:21:16,478 --> 01:21:19,038
Let's stay away from each other.

971
01:21:19,147 --> 01:21:22,742
I may still love you,
but I'll run that risk.

972
01:21:22,851 --> 01:21:26,548
Go to Gilberte
since she writes you every day.

973
01:21:26,654 --> 01:21:31,523
- You are not fair.
- I know, but I'm heartless.

974
01:21:31,626 --> 01:21:35,687
That's why I don't love you
and why I'll never love anyone.

975
01:21:35,797 --> 01:21:38,288
Besides, I'm 32, and you are 29.

976
01:21:38,399 --> 01:21:42,301
When I'm 40,
you'll want a girl of 25...

977
01:21:42,403 --> 01:21:45,201
and I'll be left alone
like a fool.

978
01:21:46,541 --> 01:21:50,341
You may be right.
I'll leave for three months.

979
01:21:52,046 --> 01:21:54,276
Are you hurt?

980
01:21:54,382 --> 01:21:56,543
I'm not anymore.

981
01:21:56,651 --> 01:21:59,119
We should never be hurt
both at once.

982
01:21:59,220 --> 01:22:02,553
When you stop suffering,
I'll start.

983
01:22:09,364 --> 01:22:11,389
Am I disturbing you?

984
01:22:17,972 --> 01:22:20,167
I can't stand it.

985
01:22:20,275 --> 01:22:24,473
- Did you hear us arguing?
- No, I was working.

986
01:22:24,579 --> 01:22:27,946
I can't stand him.
I'm going mad.

987
01:22:28,049 --> 01:22:30,745
I'm glad he's going tomorrow.
Good riddance.

988
01:22:30,852 --> 01:22:33,252
Don't be unfair.

989
01:22:33,354 --> 01:22:35,288
You know he loves you.

990
01:22:35,390 --> 01:22:38,791
I really don't know anymore.

991
01:22:39,994 --> 01:22:41,894
He lied to me.

992
01:22:41,996 --> 01:22:45,363
He didn't drop Gilberte. He doesn't
even know what he wants himself.

993
01:22:45,466 --> 01:22:49,425
I love her. I don't love her,
but I will, maybe.

994
01:22:50,872 --> 01:22:54,103
I can't help it
if we didn't have a child.

995
01:22:54,209 --> 01:22:57,701
- Got a cigarette?
- You want one?

996
01:23:09,023 --> 01:23:12,459
- Want me to talk to him?
- No, please don't.

997
01:23:12,560 --> 01:23:15,427
I'm half for him
and half against him.

998
01:23:15,530 --> 01:23:17,998
But I want him to go.

999
01:23:18,099 --> 01:23:21,296
We've decided to separate
for three months.

1000
01:23:21,402 --> 01:23:23,336
What do you think?

1001
01:23:24,439 --> 01:23:27,431
I don't know.
It may be a good idea.

1002
01:23:27,542 --> 01:23:29,874
You won't say what you think.

1003
01:23:30,979 --> 01:23:32,879
I know you despise me.

1004
01:23:34,949 --> 01:23:38,817
No, I shall never despise you.

1005
01:23:41,956 --> 01:23:44,117
I shall always love you...

1006
01:23:44,225 --> 01:23:47,319
no matter what you do,
no matter what happens.

1007
01:23:48,229 --> 01:23:50,129
Is that true?

1008
01:23:54,002 --> 01:23:56,129
I love you too.

1009
01:24:00,141 --> 01:24:03,133
We were happy, weren't we?

1010
01:24:03,244 --> 01:24:05,212
But we are happy.

1011
01:24:05,313 --> 01:24:08,976
I mean, I am.

1012
01:24:09,083 --> 01:24:11,108
Is that true?

1013
01:24:12,587 --> 01:24:16,284
Yes, let's always stay together...

1014
01:24:17,392 --> 01:24:20,361
like an old couple,
with Sabine...

1015
01:24:20,461 --> 01:24:22,793
and our grandchildren.

1016
01:24:28,870 --> 01:24:30,804
Stay near me.

1017
01:24:32,106 --> 01:24:35,542
I don't want to see him
before he goes.

1018
01:24:35,643 --> 01:24:38,077
Then stay here.

1019
01:24:38,179 --> 01:24:40,841
I'll sleep downstairs.

1020
01:24:56,497 --> 01:24:58,431
My little Catherine.

1021
01:24:59,701 --> 01:25:02,135
Often you remind me...

1022
01:25:03,271 --> 01:25:07,298
of a Chinese play I saw
before the war.

1023
01:25:07,408 --> 01:25:10,241
The curtain rises
and the emperor...

1024
01:25:10,345 --> 01:25:13,473
turns to the audience and says...

1025
01:25:14,782 --> 01:25:18,047
"I am the unhappiest man on Earth...

1026
01:25:18,152 --> 01:25:20,586
because I have two wives.

1027
01:25:20,688 --> 01:25:24,215
My first wife and my second wife."

1028
01:25:49,884 --> 01:25:54,014
<i>Their love was now relative,</i>
<i>but to Jules it was absolute.</i>

1029
01:25:55,857 --> 01:25:57,916
<i>The next morning</i>
<i>Jim left the house.</i>

1030
01:25:58,026 --> 01:26:00,517
<i>Catherine took him to the station.</i>

1031
01:26:00,628 --> 01:26:03,222
<i>A mist settled over the valley.</i>

1032
01:26:03,331 --> 01:26:07,358
<i>The hive felt that Jim</i>
<i>has lost favor with its queen.</i>

1033
01:26:07,468 --> 01:26:09,368
<i>He had to go.</i>

1034
01:26:36,564 --> 01:26:38,896
We can't see the house.

1035
01:26:46,574 --> 01:26:49,407
<i>The railway schedule had been changed.</i>

1036
01:26:49,510 --> 01:26:51,705
<i>The train left the next day.</i>

1037
01:26:59,287 --> 01:27:02,222
One always feels guilty
in a hotel room.

1038
01:27:02,323 --> 01:27:06,259
I'm not very moral,
but I dislike it.

1039
01:27:06,360 --> 01:27:09,261
Don't tell me you don't.
I wouldn't believe you.

1040
01:27:20,842 --> 01:27:23,709
<i>Jim thought of their children.</i>

1041
01:27:23,811 --> 01:27:26,871
<i>He imagined a houseful</i>
<i>of beautiful children.</i>

1042
01:27:26,981 --> 01:27:29,643
<i>He knew that if they had none...</i>

1043
01:27:29,750 --> 01:27:31,684
<i>Catherine would have affairs again.</i>

1044
01:27:32,787 --> 01:27:35,688
<i>They were silent in the gloomy</i>
<i>hotel room, but they made love.</i>

1045
01:27:35,790 --> 01:27:39,886
<i>They didn't know why. Maybe</i>
<i>it was their way to end their story.</i>

1046
01:27:39,994 --> 01:27:44,021
<i>It was like a funeral</i>
<i>and as if they were already dead.</i>

1047
01:28:03,217 --> 01:28:07,517
<i>The next day she took him to his train,</i>
<i>but they did not wave.</i>

1048
01:28:07,622 --> 01:28:11,183
<i>They separated,</i>
<i>though nothing forced them.</i>

1049
01:28:11,292 --> 01:28:14,591
<i>It's all over now,</i>
<i>Jim told himself once again.</i>

1050
01:28:35,783 --> 01:28:40,015
- Your medicine and a letter.
- Thanks.

1051
01:28:44,725 --> 01:28:47,956
<i>I think I'm pregnant.</i>
<i>Come. Catherine.</i>

1052
01:28:48,062 --> 01:28:50,963
Gilberte, please give me
some writing paper.

1053
01:28:51,065 --> 01:28:54,125
<i>Catherine, I am in bed</i>
<i>and very ill.</i>

1054
01:28:54,235 --> 01:28:57,295
<i>Besides, I doubt</i>
<i>that your child is mine.</i>

1055
01:28:57,405 --> 01:29:01,808
<i>One night could not succeed</i>
<i>where love failed.</i>

1056
01:29:01,909 --> 01:29:05,640
"Where love failed."

1057
01:29:05,746 --> 01:29:09,443
You are right.
That illness is a joke.

1058
01:29:09,550 --> 01:29:13,145
I'll write and say
you want to see him.

1059
01:29:13,254 --> 01:29:17,452
Dear Hypochondriac,
come as soon as you can.

1060
01:29:17,558 --> 01:29:19,856
Catherine awaits a letter.

1061
01:29:19,961 --> 01:29:22,361
Write in big letters
for her eyes are tired...

1062
01:29:22,463 --> 01:29:25,955
<i>and she cannot read</i>
<i>small handwriting.</i>

1063
01:29:27,668 --> 01:29:30,000
<i>She doesn't think I was ill.</i>

1064
01:29:30,104 --> 01:29:32,038
<i>I don't think she is pregnant.</i>

1065
01:29:32,139 --> 01:29:34,505
<i>In any case,</i>
<i>I doubt that I'm the father.</i>

1066
01:29:34,609 --> 01:29:36,577
<i>I've got reasons to doubt.</i>

1067
01:29:36,677 --> 01:29:39,168
<i>Our past, Albert and the rest.</i>

1068
01:29:39,280 --> 01:29:42,181
Since you're going out,
could you mail this letter?

1069
01:29:42,283 --> 01:29:43,682
Certainly.

1070
01:29:52,793 --> 01:29:55,284
Oh, there's a letter for you.

1071
01:29:56,831 --> 01:29:59,322
I'm late. See you later.

1072
01:30:03,104 --> 01:30:04,799
I love you, Jim.

1073
01:30:04,905 --> 01:30:08,773
So many unbelievable things
turn out to be true.

1074
01:30:08,876 --> 01:30:10,844
I'm going to have a child.

1075
01:30:10,945 --> 01:30:15,973
Let us thank God, Jim.
I am sure you are the father.

1076
01:30:16,083 --> 01:30:20,213
I beg you to believe me.
Your love is now alive within me.

1077
01:30:20,321 --> 01:30:22,619
You must believe me.

1078
01:30:22,723 --> 01:30:25,157
This paper is your skin.
This ink is my blood.

1079
01:30:25,259 --> 01:30:28,353
I'm pressing on my pen.
Please, answer me.

1080
01:30:43,778 --> 01:30:47,270
<i>Darling, I believe you.</i>
<i>I am going to you.</i>

1081
01:30:47,381 --> 01:30:50,373
<i>All that is good within me</i>
<i>comes from you.</i>

1082
01:30:51,585 --> 01:30:54,076
<i>They had promised</i>
<i>never to call each other.</i>

1083
01:30:54,188 --> 01:30:56,554
<i>They couldn't talk</i>
<i>if they couldn't touch each other.</i>

1084
01:30:56,657 --> 01:30:59,820
<i>The mail took three days.</i>
<i>Their letters crossed.</i>

1085
01:30:59,927 --> 01:31:05,092
<i>I've got reasons to doubt.</i>
<i>Our past, Albert and the rest.</i>

1086
01:31:05,199 --> 01:31:08,032
<i>I will stop thinking of you,</i>
<i>so that you can stop thinking of me.</i>

1087
01:31:08,135 --> 01:31:11,127
<i>You disgust me, but that is wrong.</i>

1088
01:31:11,238 --> 01:31:13,297
<i>Nothing should ever be disgusting.</i>

1089
01:31:17,178 --> 01:31:19,544
<i>My Jim, your long letter</i>
<i>changes everything.</i>

1090
01:31:19,647 --> 01:31:23,708
<i>In two days you'll be here.</i>
<i>Not a letter, but you.</i>

1091
01:31:23,818 --> 01:31:27,447
<i>Let's forget our differences.</i>
<i>They are gone.</i>

1092
01:31:27,555 --> 01:31:31,582
<i>Come back to me soon,</i>
<i>even late at night.</i>

1093
01:31:31,692 --> 01:31:33,751
<i>At last, Jim received</i>
<i>a letter from Jules.</i>

1094
01:31:34,929 --> 01:31:38,194
"Your child died
before it could be born.

1095
01:31:38,299 --> 01:31:40,665
To Catherine, you died with it."

1096
01:31:41,769 --> 01:31:43,999
<i>They had created nothing.</i>

1097
01:31:44,105 --> 01:31:47,438
<i>Jim thought,</i>
<i>new laws are beautiful...</i>

1098
01:31:47,541 --> 01:31:51,170
<i>but it's more practical</i>
<i>to obey old ones.</i>

1099
01:31:51,278 --> 01:31:53,712
<i>We played with life and lost.</i>

1100
01:32:09,830 --> 01:32:11,730
I don't believe it.

1101
01:32:11,832 --> 01:32:14,096
- You gave up your cottage?
- Yes.

1102
01:32:14,201 --> 01:32:16,192
We're living in France now.

1103
01:32:16,303 --> 01:32:19,170
We've rented an old mill
on the Seine.

1104
01:32:19,273 --> 01:32:23,004
We must see each other.
Drop in tomorrow.

1105
01:32:24,879 --> 01:32:26,870
Please tell me about Catherine.

1106
01:32:26,981 --> 01:32:29,814
For a long time,
I feared she'd commit suicide.

1107
01:32:29,917 --> 01:32:32,112
She had bought a gun.

1108
01:32:32,219 --> 01:32:35,279
She would say,
"So-and-so killed himself"...

1109
01:32:35,389 --> 01:32:39,018
like others say,
"So-and-so died of cholera."

1110
01:32:39,126 --> 01:32:43,460
She seemed to be in mourning.
She looked like she'd been ill.

1111
01:32:43,564 --> 01:32:48,365
She moved in slow motion
with a dead smile on her face.

1112
01:32:50,171 --> 01:32:52,264
Gilberte, this is my friend Jules.

1113
01:32:53,707 --> 01:32:58,838
Jim has told me so much about you.
I feel like I know you.

1114
01:33:03,184 --> 01:33:05,209
Does Catherine know
you've come to see me?

1115
01:33:05,319 --> 01:33:08,550
Yes. She's inviting you
for a ride in her car.

1116
01:33:08,656 --> 01:33:11,352
I'd like you
and maybe your wife to come.

1117
01:33:11,459 --> 01:33:15,896
- She won't accept, but I will.
- I've got to go now.

1118
01:33:17,398 --> 01:33:20,890
No, Jules! You can't wear a hat
like that, at least not in France.

1119
01:33:21,001 --> 01:33:23,492
Here. Take mine.

1120
01:33:27,408 --> 01:33:29,808
- Hello.
- Hi.

1121
01:33:29,910 --> 01:33:32,003
Come. It's over there.

1122
01:33:45,092 --> 01:33:47,253
She's in a good mood today.

1123
01:33:47,361 --> 01:33:49,295
Don't jar her.

1124
01:33:50,965 --> 01:33:52,865
Your place is beautiful.

1125
01:33:52,967 --> 01:33:55,800
Look at her car.

1126
01:34:04,678 --> 01:34:06,077
It's Jim.

1127
01:34:21,495 --> 01:34:24,987
<i>Catherine smiled,</i>
<i>but she looked mysterious.</i>

1128
01:34:25,099 --> 01:34:29,559
<i>She took her white pajamas and</i>
<i>wrapped them in a neat parcel.</i>

1129
01:34:30,871 --> 01:34:33,704
<i>Jim wondered why</i>
<i>and then forgot about it.</i>

1130
01:34:33,807 --> 01:34:36,002
<i>They went for a drive.</i>

1131
01:35:10,210 --> 01:35:12,701
I'm hungry. Let's eat here.

1132
01:35:42,242 --> 01:35:44,506
Albert, what are you doing here?

1133
01:35:44,612 --> 01:35:46,512
Getting some fresh air.

1134
01:35:49,016 --> 01:35:51,507
Besides, I live here.

1135
01:35:51,619 --> 01:35:54,486
- Will you eat with us?
- Sure, if we eat now.

1136
01:35:54,588 --> 01:35:57,716
- You got a date?
- Perhaps.

1137
01:36:18,278 --> 01:36:21,770
Please give me my parcel.
Good night.

1138
01:36:31,558 --> 01:36:34,459
She's done it again.

1139
01:36:34,561 --> 01:36:36,461
I didn't expect it.

1140
01:36:36,563 --> 01:36:39,589
I thought she'd use
a new leading man.

1141
01:36:39,700 --> 01:36:43,329
- Albert is an old story.
- He was perfect for tonight.

1142
01:36:43,437 --> 01:36:45,871
Leave her the car.

1143
01:36:45,973 --> 01:36:50,672
She thinks that in a couple, at least
only one person needs to be faithful.

1144
01:36:50,778 --> 01:36:54,111
- The other...
- I must go home.

1145
01:36:54,214 --> 01:36:56,739
You saw that I'm not living alone.

1146
01:36:56,850 --> 01:37:00,149
- I'm going to marry Gilberte.
- You're wiser than I am.

1147
01:37:00,254 --> 01:37:04,020
You've realized that when it's over
with Catherine, it's all over.

1148
01:37:04,124 --> 01:37:06,649
Gilberte will make a good wife.

1149
01:37:06,760 --> 01:37:08,660
She's very beautiful.

1150
01:37:19,273 --> 01:37:22,538
<i>Jim recognized Catherine's car.</i>

1151
01:37:22,643 --> 01:37:25,373
<i>First he saw nothing.</i>

1152
01:37:25,479 --> 01:37:29,438
<i>Then he saw the car</i>
<i>weaving on the empty square...</i>

1153
01:37:29,550 --> 01:37:32,986
<i>like a riderless horse,</i>
<i>like a ghost ship.</i>

1154
01:38:01,782 --> 01:38:05,149
What a night.
I made a mistake.

1155
01:38:05,252 --> 01:38:08,085
That life was dead for me.

1156
01:38:08,188 --> 01:38:10,554
It was a desert, Jim.

1157
01:38:10,657 --> 01:38:13,057
I kept looking for you.

1158
01:38:13,160 --> 01:38:15,321
<i>Then come right away.</i>

1159
01:38:30,410 --> 01:38:34,244
Lie down next to me.
Kiss me.

1160
01:38:34,348 --> 01:38:37,613
There's something I must tell you.

1161
01:38:37,718 --> 01:38:39,117
Say it.

1162
01:38:43,891 --> 01:38:47,588
I found a passage
you had marked in a book.

1163
01:38:48,695 --> 01:38:50,856
"On a ship, a woman made love...

1164
01:38:50,964 --> 01:38:54,365
to a stranger in her mind."

1165
01:38:54,468 --> 01:38:57,130
It struck me as a confession.

1166
01:38:57,237 --> 01:39:00,172
That's how you explore the universe.

1167
01:39:00,274 --> 01:39:02,765
I feel that curiosity too.

1168
01:39:02,876 --> 01:39:04,810
Perhaps everyone does.

1169
01:39:04,912 --> 01:39:08,507
I overcome it for your sake,
but you don't.

1170
01:39:10,217 --> 01:39:12,344
In love, I agree with you...

1171
01:39:12,452 --> 01:39:14,920
a couple is not ideal.

1172
01:39:16,423 --> 01:39:19,415
Just look around you.

1173
01:39:19,526 --> 01:39:21,994
You wanted something better...

1174
01:39:22,095 --> 01:39:24,563
by refusing to submit
to hypocrisy.

1175
01:39:25,732 --> 01:39:29,293
You wanted to invent love.

1176
01:39:30,771 --> 01:39:34,332
But pioneers must be
humble and unselfish.

1177
01:39:34,441 --> 01:39:37,467
Let's face it.

1178
01:39:37,578 --> 01:39:40,979
We have failed in everything.

1179
01:39:43,417 --> 01:39:45,647
You tried to change me.

1180
01:39:46,987 --> 01:39:50,582
I tried to spread joy,
but I've created only pain.

1181
01:39:52,459 --> 01:39:55,758
I promised to marry Gilberte...

1182
01:39:55,863 --> 01:39:58,832
but I can't postpone
my promise endlessly.

1183
01:39:58,932 --> 01:40:01,230
It's counterfeit.

1184
01:40:01,335 --> 01:40:04,463
I've no longer any hope
of marrying you.

1185
01:40:04,571 --> 01:40:08,473
Catherine, I am going
to marry Gilberte.

1186
01:40:08,575 --> 01:40:11,169
We can still have children.

1187
01:40:12,279 --> 01:40:14,975
How touching.

1188
01:40:16,884 --> 01:40:20,843
What about me?
What about me?

1189
01:40:22,522 --> 01:40:25,218
What about the children I wanted?

1190
01:40:25,325 --> 01:40:28,522
- You didn't want any.
- I did.

1191
01:40:31,565 --> 01:40:34,125
They would have been beautiful.

1192
01:40:43,744 --> 01:40:45,678
You are going to die.

1193
01:40:45,779 --> 01:40:48,714
You disgust me, Jim.
I'm going to kill you.

1194
01:40:53,987 --> 01:40:56,751
You're a coward. You're scared.

1195
01:42:16,203 --> 01:42:21,266
<i>Jim was glad to see Jules and to</i>
<i>see that Catherine left him cold.</i>

1196
01:42:21,375 --> 01:42:24,572
<i>She tried not to leave them alone</i>
<i>and suggested a ride.</i>

1197
01:42:24,678 --> 01:42:26,839
<i>Jim agreed.</i>
<i>But where to?</i>

1198
01:42:27,948 --> 01:42:32,044
<i>Catherine drove fast</i>
<i>and carelessly.</i>

1199
01:42:32,152 --> 01:42:37,055
<i>Something was in the air,</i>
<i>Just like the day they met Albert.</i>

1200
01:42:37,157 --> 01:42:40,593
<i>They stopped in a café by a pond.</i>

1201
01:42:40,694 --> 01:42:45,063
- Now they're burning books.
- It's unbelievable.

1202
01:42:52,272 --> 01:42:55,673
Catherine found
you were easy to get...

1203
01:42:55,776 --> 01:42:57,971
and hard to keep.

1204
01:42:58,078 --> 01:43:01,775
Your love vanished and returned...

1205
01:43:01,882 --> 01:43:04,578
with hers.

1206
01:43:04,684 --> 01:43:08,176
I never knew those ups and downs.

1207
01:43:08,288 --> 01:43:11,086
Mr. Jim, I've something to tell you.

1208
01:43:11,191 --> 01:43:13,216
Will you come with me?

1209
01:43:18,832 --> 01:43:20,925
Watch us, Jules.

1210
01:43:46,393 --> 01:43:48,987
<i>Jules would no longer dread,</i>
<i>as he had from the beginning...</i>

1211
01:43:49,096 --> 01:43:51,257
<i>her unfaithfulness</i>
<i>and that he might lose her...</i>

1212
01:43:51,364 --> 01:43:53,355
<i>since she was gone now.</i>

1213
01:43:53,467 --> 01:43:55,935
<i>Their bodies were found</i>
<i>in the river.</i>

1214
01:43:56,036 --> 01:43:58,163
<i>Jim's coffin was huge.</i>

1215
01:43:58,271 --> 01:44:00,466
<i>It dwarfed Catherine's.</i>

1216
01:44:00,574 --> 01:44:04,340
<i>They left nothing of themselves.</i>
<i>But Jules had his daughter.</i>

1217
01:44:05,512 --> 01:44:08,709
<i>Did Catherine merely</i>
<i>seek excitement? No.</i>

1218
01:44:08,815 --> 01:44:11,079
<i>But she had dazed Jules.</i>

1219
01:44:11,184 --> 01:44:13,516
<i>He was overcome with relief.</i>

1220
01:44:16,990 --> 01:44:20,084
<i>The friendship of Jules and Jim</i>
<i>had no equivalent in love.</i>

1221
01:44:20,193 --> 01:44:22,388
<i>They enjoyed little things together.</i>

1222
01:44:22,496 --> 01:44:24,987
<i>They accepted their differences</i>
<i>with tenderness.</i>

1223
01:44:25,098 --> 01:44:29,330
<i>Everyone called them</i>
<i>Don Quixote and Sancho Panza.</i>

1224
01:45:34,334 --> 01:45:37,826
<i>The ashes were placed in an urn.</i>

1225
01:45:38,939 --> 01:45:41,134
<i>Jules might have mixed them.</i>

1226
01:45:41,241 --> 01:45:44,938
<i>Catherine wanted hers</i>
<i>to be cast to the wind...</i>

1227
01:45:45,045 --> 01:45:47,445
<i>but that was not permitted.</i>
