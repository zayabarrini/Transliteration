1
00:01:01,937 --> 00:01:04,647
There is so little deep down.

2
00:01:04,815 --> 00:01:09,652
Millions of millions of tons
of water, rocks and gas.

3
00:01:10,279 --> 00:01:11,654
Affection.

4
00:01:11,864 --> 00:01:13,156
Blood.

5
00:01:13,365 --> 00:01:15,825
A hundred minutes, a thousand years.

6
00:01:16,535 --> 00:01:19,078
Ashes. Light. Now.

7
00:01:19,955 --> 00:01:21,164
This now.

8
00:01:21,457 --> 00:01:24,125
A while ago...

9
00:01:33,093 --> 00:01:34,093
Fire!

10
00:01:45,105 --> 00:01:46,105
No!

11
00:01:58,494 --> 00:02:01,329
I told you before, didn't I?

12
00:02:01,538 --> 00:02:03,664
There are very few things...

13
00:02:03,874 --> 00:02:06,000
Silence and words.

14
00:02:52,714 --> 00:02:59,971
The secret life of words

15
00:04:32,564 --> 00:04:35,942
Hanna Amiran, please come to the main office.

16
00:04:38,570 --> 00:04:40,196
Hanna Amiran, right?

17
00:04:40,656 --> 00:04:43,908
Yes.
- And you've been with us for 4 years?

18
00:04:44,701 --> 00:04:46,327
Yes, that's right.

19
00:04:49,414 --> 00:04:50,790
We're happy with you.

20
00:04:51,458 --> 00:04:55,836
You don't have to worry,
as far as the company is concerned.

21
00:04:57,547 --> 00:05:01,592
Very satisfied, I can assure you.
- Good.

22
00:05:06,223 --> 00:05:09,183
The problem here is the others.

23
00:05:10,560 --> 00:05:14,855
Your colleagues, your workmates,
the people you work with.

24
00:05:15,816 --> 00:05:16,816
There's been...

25
00:05:17,776 --> 00:05:20,277
complaints, reports...

26
00:05:20,779 --> 00:05:23,531
The trade union committee, you know.

27
00:05:24,866 --> 00:05:28,703
No, I don't.

28
00:05:31,873 --> 00:05:35,167
Am I being fired?

29
00:05:36,253 --> 00:05:37,962
Should I go now?
- Hanna,

30
00:05:38,255 --> 00:05:42,133
I have just told you,
we are happy with you.

31
00:05:42,342 --> 00:05:44,468
How could I sack you?

32
00:05:44,761 --> 00:05:50,182
In your 4 years with us, you've never
taken a holiday, never been sick or late.

33
00:05:50,350 --> 00:05:55,021
How can I possible give you the sack?

34
00:05:57,524 --> 00:06:00,901
Take a months holiday, for Christ's sake.

35
00:06:01,653 --> 00:06:03,529
A whole month?

36
00:06:04,322 --> 00:06:08,617
Yeah, I've got some brochures, here.

37
00:06:08,827 --> 00:06:13,372
Just in case I decide to go myself,
one of these days.

38
00:06:13,582 --> 00:06:17,918
You know, there's some beautiful,
heavenly places to go in the world.

39
00:06:18,420 --> 00:06:21,005
Places that...

40
00:06:21,214 --> 00:06:24,300
Places with palm trees,
and lounges on the beach.

41
00:06:24,509 --> 00:06:29,263
And waiters serving piÃ±a colada,
and that drink with the smoke in it.

42
00:06:29,681 --> 00:06:31,348
And aerobics in the pool.

43
00:06:31,683 --> 00:06:33,726
Here, look.

44
00:06:35,228 --> 00:06:37,563
Take the ones you want.
I'll get more.

45
00:06:38,857 --> 00:06:42,985
I've got plenty more.

46
00:06:44,196 --> 00:06:47,782
What's the matter, don't you like palm trees?

47
00:06:51,703 --> 00:06:54,914
Palm trees are okay, but...
- But what?

48
00:06:56,083 --> 00:06:57,458
Do they...

49
00:07:02,005 --> 00:07:05,341
Do they make you do aerobics in the pool?

50
00:07:05,842 --> 00:07:09,220
What happens if you don't want to?

51
00:08:17,664 --> 00:08:19,874
She has never seen my face,

52
00:08:20,083 --> 00:08:22,293
but I'm her only company.

53
00:08:23,128 --> 00:08:26,422
She sees me dressed
in red corduroy dungarees.

54
00:08:26,631 --> 00:08:29,383
A light blue polo jersey.

55
00:08:29,676 --> 00:08:33,470
The dungarees are always red.
The jersey's always blue.

56
00:08:34,139 --> 00:08:36,515
Why?
She doesn't know why.

57
00:08:38,018 --> 00:08:40,477
The hair is never the same.

58
00:08:40,687 --> 00:08:44,481
Sometimes shoulder length,
and sometimes this way...

59
00:08:44,691 --> 00:08:48,736
Let me tell you,
a horrible pudding bowl cut.

60
00:08:50,488 --> 00:08:52,489
I like cold milk.

61
00:08:52,699 --> 00:08:55,367
When it's hot, makes me feel sick.

62
00:09:04,002 --> 00:09:05,461
Inge speaking.

63
00:09:07,047 --> 00:09:11,717
Hello?

64
00:09:13,011 --> 00:09:15,095
Is that you, Hanna?

65
00:09:16,932 --> 00:09:22,728
Well, if there's no heavy breathing
or groaning, I'll know it's you.

66
00:09:27,400 --> 00:09:30,653
Did you answer my last letter?

67
00:09:32,322 --> 00:09:35,783
Do you ever read them?
I wouldn't ask you to answer them.

68
00:09:38,411 --> 00:09:41,538
Oh, Hanna. Hanna...

69
00:10:35,552 --> 00:10:39,263
She told me stories tonight.
They were a bit scary.

70
00:10:40,640 --> 00:10:45,269
And then, she lied down by my side
until I closed my eyes.

71
00:10:45,478 --> 00:10:47,479
She's stroking my hair.

72
00:10:47,689 --> 00:10:51,358
It's too long.
I'll have to get it cut soon.

73
00:11:27,270 --> 00:11:32,399
Sure, Claude Van Damme's got more muscle,
but Vin Diesel's a better actor.

74
00:11:32,609 --> 00:11:36,195
There's not much difference
as far as muscle's concerned.

75
00:11:36,404 --> 00:11:40,449
But there's no doubt about it,
Vin Diesel acts better.

76
00:11:40,617 --> 00:11:42,743
Want a biscuit?

77
00:11:42,952 --> 00:11:49,333
I didn't bring any chocolate ones,
because I know you're not a chocolate person.

78
00:12:10,063 --> 00:12:14,274
Oh...
- It's nice to get out of there...

79
00:12:14,484 --> 00:12:16,110
Stretch your legs...

80
00:13:40,778 --> 00:13:41,778
Okay.

81
00:13:42,780 --> 00:13:47,576
Look, we're not talking about over night,
are we?

82
00:13:47,785 --> 00:13:51,663
Let me do things right, for once?
Or is this an emergency?

83
00:13:51,873 --> 00:13:54,958
Tell me we're talking about a real emergency.

84
00:13:55,168 --> 00:14:00,339
Yeah. Could I have a little more
sweet and sour sauce, and some hot sauce?

85
00:14:01,216 --> 00:14:05,427
Sorry, just trying to eat, as if you didn't
know. It's my lunch hour.

86
00:14:05,637 --> 00:14:07,387
I know you're sorry about it.

87
00:14:07,597 --> 00:14:11,558
Where do I find a nurse
to look after him till we get him off?

88
00:14:11,768 --> 00:14:14,937
Or a male nurse
who wants to spend a few days...

89
00:14:15,396 --> 00:14:20,234
I'll call you. I'll call.
Okay, bye.

90
00:14:29,619 --> 00:14:32,162
I'm a nurse.

91
00:14:32,372 --> 00:14:38,293
Sorry about the mess.
There's 3 of them, you know what it's like.

92
00:14:38,503 --> 00:14:42,130
There's nothing else on the seat, is there?

93
00:14:42,340 --> 00:14:46,885
You're luck the youngest wasn't sick today.
Smell takes ages to go away.

94
00:14:47,095 --> 00:14:50,847
It's awful. I mean, even if
it's your own kids, it's awful.

95
00:14:51,391 --> 00:14:57,771
This'll only take a few weeks at the most,
until he's well enough for us to get him off.

96
00:14:58,565 --> 00:15:03,652
After the death taking place
the company can't run any more risks.

97
00:15:03,861 --> 00:15:08,699
I'm not speaking too fast, am I?
- No, I understand you.

98
00:15:08,908 --> 00:15:10,909
The problem is the noise.

99
00:15:11,119 --> 00:15:16,039
Boom, boom, the noise of the pumping.
There are places where you hardly notice it.

100
00:15:16,249 --> 00:15:21,461
It's no where to go on holiday, although...
When the oil runs out, and it will soon,

101
00:15:21,671 --> 00:15:25,882
our grandkids will
be using propane or chow shit, you'll see.

102
00:15:26,050 --> 00:15:31,471
And when it runs out you'll see them turn
these places into hotels and theme parks.

103
00:15:33,600 --> 00:15:38,103
I'm gonna stop off at the chemist
and get what Dr. Sulitzer wants.

104
00:15:38,313 --> 00:15:43,650
Here's the list. Do you want to see it?
- If the doctor said this, it'll be fine.

105
00:15:43,901 --> 00:15:45,152
Of course.

106
00:15:46,237 --> 00:15:48,113
There's levels, isn't there?

107
00:15:48,323 --> 00:15:51,408
If it comes from higher up...

108
00:15:51,618 --> 00:15:54,786
It's a power pyramid, isn't it, eh?

109
00:16:47,548 --> 00:16:51,093
Where is it going?
Does it really matter?

110
00:16:51,302 --> 00:16:55,889
Do you think she really minds
floating above 50,000 tons of steel,

111
00:16:56,099 --> 00:16:59,976
which are hit by 28,000 waves every day?

112
00:17:00,186 --> 00:17:01,436
Sometimes more?

113
00:17:01,813 --> 00:17:02,938
Is that all?

114
00:17:03,147 --> 00:17:05,899
Killing time before time kills you.

115
00:17:06,067 --> 00:17:07,150
Is that all?

116
00:17:07,360 --> 00:17:11,113
Waves and more waves.
Never two the same.

117
00:17:40,935 --> 00:17:45,897
This is Hanna, the nurse who's
looking after the casualty. What's his name?

118
00:17:46,065 --> 00:17:50,986
Josef. The doctor's with him.
You'll find the way? Down there.

119
00:17:51,195 --> 00:17:54,573
We've got to load the...
- Should I take your stuff?

120
00:17:56,200 --> 00:17:59,119
Okay?
- Come this way.

121
00:18:23,728 --> 00:18:26,396
You alright, there?
Martin! Martin!

122
00:18:26,731 --> 00:18:30,400
Martin, Martin!
Give us a hand, mate.

123
00:18:35,615 --> 00:18:41,286
I don't know if it's further up.
I'm usually in the refinery, you know.

124
00:18:41,829 --> 00:18:43,663
Only been here 4 or 5 times.

125
00:18:46,125 --> 00:18:51,171
Make sure they give you the grand tour,
otherwise you'll keep getting lost.

126
00:18:51,756 --> 00:18:54,841
I'll ask Dimitri,
he's the man in charge here.

127
00:18:55,843 --> 00:19:00,263
You don't smoke, do you?
I forgot to tell you there's no smoking here.

128
00:19:00,515 --> 00:19:03,767
Or you can imagine why.
- No.

129
00:19:03,976 --> 00:19:10,065
Good. I'm trying to give up, myself.

130
00:19:25,039 --> 00:19:29,417
Hello. You must be the nurse
that Victor managed to find.

131
00:19:29,627 --> 00:19:31,586
Hanna Amiran.

132
00:19:31,796 --> 00:19:35,465
Have you ever taken care of burns before?

133
00:19:35,675 --> 00:19:40,095
That's what Victor said.
- Yes, I was in the burn recovery unit.

134
00:19:40,304 --> 00:19:46,935
Oh, good. Good. Well, actually,
he has fractures too, to an arm and a leg.

135
00:19:48,187 --> 00:19:52,399
There are burns to his body and face and...

136
00:19:52,567 --> 00:19:55,068
There's some damage to his corneas.

137
00:19:55,361 --> 00:19:59,823
He won't be able to see anything
for the next two weeks.

138
00:20:00,032 --> 00:20:03,159
Maybe less, but by then,
he'll be out of here.

139
00:20:03,995 --> 00:20:05,537
You better come this way.

140
00:20:14,213 --> 00:20:19,718
It was Josef's room, in fact.
It's the nearest one to the sickbay.

141
00:20:19,927 --> 00:20:23,305
Sorry,
I haven't had a chance to clear up yet.

142
00:20:25,099 --> 00:20:28,226
The man who hired me
said there's a constant sound.

143
00:20:28,978 --> 00:20:31,438
A noise.

144
00:20:31,647 --> 00:20:33,523
Well, we're almost shut down.

145
00:20:33,900 --> 00:20:39,571
Since the accident the rig's...
Well, it's shutting down since the accident.

146
00:20:39,822 --> 00:20:43,074
We're just waiting to find out
what'll happen to...

147
00:20:43,576 --> 00:20:46,703
To all of us.
You know, the company.

148
00:20:50,207 --> 00:20:51,207
Shall we?

149
00:21:13,439 --> 00:21:16,358
I've just given him a painkiller.

150
00:21:16,567 --> 00:21:20,362
The facial injuries
have been giving him some trouble.

151
00:21:20,571 --> 00:21:23,073
Like I said, he'll be blind for a while.

152
00:21:23,282 --> 00:21:27,911
Shall I put some of this in the fridge?
- Yeah, sure. Go ahead.

153
00:21:28,871 --> 00:21:31,331
Actually, put it all in there.

154
00:21:32,124 --> 00:21:36,962
It's because of the damp.
It's unbelievably damp here.

155
00:21:38,881 --> 00:21:43,635
So, you worked at a hospital in this country?
- No.

156
00:21:43,803 --> 00:21:49,516
Is it that important? Fracture is fracture,
burn is burn. Here and everywhere.

157
00:21:49,725 --> 00:21:55,355
I take care of the temperature chart,
give painkillers, help him urinate, clean him.

158
00:21:55,606 --> 00:22:00,610
I've done it before with people
who were much worse than he is.

159
00:22:01,779 --> 00:22:06,324
If he gets really bad,
then I call you, I suppose.

160
00:22:07,201 --> 00:22:11,079
Yes, of course. Forgive me.

161
00:22:13,249 --> 00:22:17,627
Yes, you can call me from Dimitri's office.

162
00:22:22,258 --> 00:22:28,972
I... You know, my wife's a foreigner, too.
She's Columbian.

163
00:22:31,392 --> 00:22:34,853
I mean... I'm not prejudiced.

164
00:22:35,688 --> 00:22:41,693
I wouldn't like you to think I'm prejudiced.
I'm not that kind of person.

165
00:22:44,822 --> 00:22:47,032
Maybe you are not...

166
00:22:47,950 --> 00:22:49,826
But I am.

167
00:24:26,215 --> 00:24:28,758
You have 1 new message.

168
00:24:29,969 --> 00:24:34,722
Josef, Hi. Here I am.

169
00:24:35,516 --> 00:24:40,186
I'm reading "Letters of a Portuguese Nun",
again, I know, it's silly.

170
00:24:41,313 --> 00:24:45,984
But, reading that book,
I feel like I'm talking to you.

171
00:24:46,819 --> 00:24:52,240
Like I'm close to you, and if I'm close to
you I don't feel guilty anymore.

172
00:24:52,449 --> 00:24:57,787
I dream of you every night. Maybe because I
go to bed listening to the message you left,

173
00:24:57,997 --> 00:25:01,207
saying how much you liked missing me.

174
00:25:01,417 --> 00:25:06,087
Josef, I love you.
Like that Portuguese nun, even more.

175
00:25:08,382 --> 00:25:10,842
Much more. Come on, call me.

176
00:25:11,135 --> 00:25:14,804
Call me, I know, it's not easy...
But, but...

177
00:25:15,598 --> 00:25:20,685
Call me, my love, please?
Okay. I love you so much.

178
00:25:21,729 --> 00:25:25,899
So much. Bye-bye. Bye.

179
00:25:46,670 --> 00:25:49,047
Sulitzer?

180
00:25:49,590 --> 00:25:53,635
Sulitzer, I need a drink
and I got to piss like a racehorse.

181
00:25:54,887 --> 00:25:56,346
The doctor has gone.

182
00:25:57,056 --> 00:25:58,598
I'm the nurse.

183
00:26:00,809 --> 00:26:03,228
Nurse?
Am I...

184
00:26:03,771 --> 00:26:08,066
Where am I?
Did they take me somewhere?

185
00:26:08,901 --> 00:26:14,072
No, we're still here. On the oil rig.

186
00:26:16,242 --> 00:26:19,118
They brought you here to look after me?

187
00:26:20,037 --> 00:26:24,415
Fuck, man. They must be really worried.

188
00:26:25,459 --> 00:26:27,752
I'll get the bedpan.

189
00:26:58,492 --> 00:27:01,995
Your name wouldn't be Cora,
by any chance, would it?

190
00:27:02,204 --> 00:27:03,663
No.

191
00:27:05,332 --> 00:27:07,375
What's your name?

192
00:27:08,544 --> 00:27:12,213
Now you're holding my dick
and I'm pissing in front of you.

193
00:27:12,423 --> 00:27:16,009
We could call each other by our first names.
Maybe even...

194
00:27:16,218 --> 00:27:20,513
Start a new life together.
Get married, have kids.

195
00:27:20,723 --> 00:27:23,975
Where are you from?

196
00:27:27,896 --> 00:27:30,189
Are you married?

197
00:27:32,693 --> 00:27:35,361
Got a boyfriend?

198
00:27:35,696 --> 00:27:37,238
Girlfriend?

199
00:27:39,158 --> 00:27:42,827
Are you a day person
or a night person?

200
00:27:44,913 --> 00:27:51,711
Do you prefer circumcised men, or do you
think it really doesn't matter anyway?

201
00:27:52,796 --> 00:27:57,008
The last drop, as my mother used to say.

202
00:28:07,353 --> 00:28:11,647
You don't have to answer
about being married, that was rude.

203
00:28:11,857 --> 00:28:14,901
But the one about circumcised men?

204
00:28:15,110 --> 00:28:19,238
I'm not leaving here
until you give me an answer.

205
00:28:22,493 --> 00:28:23,868
Lift up your arm.

206
00:28:27,790 --> 00:28:32,001
I like your accent.
Is it Swedish, or Russian?

207
00:28:36,715 --> 00:28:41,636
That hurt. Oh, fuck.
- I'll get you a painkiller in a few hours.

208
00:28:42,179 --> 00:28:44,680
Are you hungry?

209
00:28:49,353 --> 00:28:53,981
Are you blond?
I bet you're a blond.

210
00:28:55,025 --> 00:28:57,860
You got a blonde's voice.

211
00:28:58,028 --> 00:29:02,698
Like butter, and cinnamon.

212
00:29:03,742 --> 00:29:10,331
Like those Danish cookies
they sell in the round, blue, metal tins.

213
00:29:11,834 --> 00:29:14,585
Here's some water.

214
00:29:24,388 --> 00:29:26,055
It's enough?

215
00:29:40,779 --> 00:29:47,034
Are you sure your name's not Cora?
- I'll change your bandages tomorrow.

216
00:29:52,458 --> 00:29:55,209
My body is itchy all over.

217
00:29:56,211 --> 00:29:59,172
Guess that means I'm still alive.

218
00:29:59,381 --> 00:30:01,299
Yippee.

219
00:30:02,217 --> 00:30:05,052
Lift up your arm, again.

220
00:30:12,352 --> 00:30:17,565
I'll go and fetch your supper,
and later I'll give you another painkiller.

221
00:30:21,195 --> 00:30:24,947
Aren't you even gonna tell me your name?

222
00:30:29,870 --> 00:30:31,913
Cora.

223
00:30:32,581 --> 00:30:35,833
You can call me Cora.

224
00:30:36,126 --> 00:30:38,961
And I'm a redhead.

225
00:31:16,208 --> 00:31:17,458
Hi.

226
00:31:25,384 --> 00:31:28,052
I've come to...
- You like Italian food?

227
00:31:28,262 --> 00:31:32,056
I hope so, because that's what's on tonight.

228
00:31:32,266 --> 00:31:36,310
Sorry, I'm Simon, the cook,
you must be Hanna,

229
00:31:36,520 --> 00:31:38,771
Victor told me, how's Josef?
- He's...

230
00:31:38,981 --> 00:31:43,651
Okay, Simon, Hanna, Victor, Josef.
I said four names in one sentence.

231
00:31:43,902 --> 00:31:48,614
Considering his condition, he's alright.
I've come for his supper.

232
00:31:48,824 --> 00:31:54,161
Yeah, gnocchi "diavola" and beef.

233
00:31:54,329 --> 00:31:58,082
With basil leaves and pink pepper.

234
00:32:02,546 --> 00:32:06,507
Where you from?
I could cook you something from your country.

235
00:32:06,925 --> 00:32:08,593
If you want.

236
00:32:09,511 --> 00:32:12,638
Don't bother yourself.
- It's no bother.

237
00:32:13,056 --> 00:32:15,891
It's what I do to stop going up the wall.

238
00:32:16,226 --> 00:32:19,645
You know,
I cook something different, everyday.

239
00:32:20,063 --> 00:32:23,941
I put on music
from the same place the recipe's from.

240
00:32:26,028 --> 00:32:32,366
I've got to do something.
This place is a completely...

241
00:32:32,576 --> 00:32:35,953
How could I explain?
A real bore. Let's see...

242
00:32:36,246 --> 00:32:39,415
Shall I put the ice cream
on the tray, as well?

243
00:32:39,666 --> 00:32:45,713
It's not real mascarpone, it's Philly spread
with a dollop of fresh cream.

244
00:32:46,882 --> 00:32:48,841
I think it'll be just right.

245
00:32:49,760 --> 00:32:54,472
Will you come back after supper?
There's plenty of food.

246
00:32:54,681 --> 00:32:59,393
If you want I can fix up the gnocchi...
- It depends on how Josef feels.

247
00:32:59,603 --> 00:33:05,608
Yeah, of course, of course.
Or I could bring your tray to your room.

248
00:33:19,706 --> 00:33:21,666
Open.

249
00:33:27,130 --> 00:33:28,798
It's good.

250
00:33:30,509 --> 00:33:34,970
What kind of pasta is it?
- I don't know. Open.

251
00:33:35,430 --> 00:33:38,265
He said it was something like nokkies.

252
00:33:42,229 --> 00:33:47,149
Simon's a good cook. I don't know why
he's wasting his time here for.

253
00:33:48,485 --> 00:33:49,985
What's for dessert?

254
00:33:51,571 --> 00:33:54,740
Don't you want some more?
There's beef, later.

255
00:33:55,659 --> 00:33:58,411
Is it ice cream?
I love ice cream.

256
00:33:58,620 --> 00:34:02,957
Yes. Cheese ice, he said, I think.
- Mascarpone, my favorite.

257
00:34:06,044 --> 00:34:09,255
What kind of food do you like, Cora?

258
00:34:10,507 --> 00:34:12,341
Open.

259
00:34:12,551 --> 00:34:15,678
I like chicken.

260
00:34:16,096 --> 00:34:20,891
Hallelujah, that's the first piece of
information you've given me.

261
00:34:21,101 --> 00:34:25,146
Aside from being a redhead,
which I don't believe.

262
00:34:25,313 --> 00:34:29,108
Go on. I'm excited now.
Chicken, what else?

263
00:34:30,193 --> 00:34:31,444
Rice.

264
00:34:33,196 --> 00:34:35,948
White rice, and apples.

265
00:34:43,373 --> 00:34:45,124
Yeah, go on.

266
00:34:50,005 --> 00:34:51,088
Nothing else.

267
00:34:52,591 --> 00:34:54,425
Nothing else?

268
00:34:55,552 --> 00:34:59,054
That's all you eat? Come on, now.

269
00:34:59,848 --> 00:35:02,808
Don't you like chocolate?

270
00:35:03,226 --> 00:35:07,855
Don't you have a weakness
for coconut Bounty bars?

271
00:35:09,191 --> 00:35:11,525
Sunflower seeds?

272
00:35:12,277 --> 00:35:15,279
Honey roasted peanuts?

273
00:35:16,406 --> 00:35:20,367
HÃ¤agen Dazs ginger and lychee ice cream?

274
00:35:20,577 --> 00:35:25,372
Come on, Cora. What about spinach lasagna?

275
00:35:28,752 --> 00:35:34,256
Come on. Lamb curry with currants and dates?
Jesus, what's wrong with you, Cora?

276
00:35:35,801 --> 00:35:39,345
What kind of rock you been hiding under?
- Want more...

277
00:35:39,554 --> 00:35:43,474
No. Just give me the fucking painkiller.

278
00:35:45,477 --> 00:35:49,146
Chicken, white rice and apples.

279
00:37:38,840 --> 00:37:42,676
You didn't come for dinner, last night.

280
00:37:44,137 --> 00:37:46,263
I wasn't hungry.

281
00:37:48,266 --> 00:37:52,478
Simon wanted to bring you a tray,
but I told him you...

282
00:37:52,687 --> 00:37:57,316
Iooked like someone
who wants to be left alone.

283
00:38:00,320 --> 00:38:01,695
Thanks.

284
00:38:02,405 --> 00:38:04,365
It's alright.

285
00:38:04,950 --> 00:38:07,701
I like to be left alone, too.

286
00:38:08,495 --> 00:38:12,539
Suppose that's why I'm here.

287
00:38:12,999 --> 00:38:15,542
Like the rest.

288
00:38:18,964 --> 00:38:22,424
The goose is called Lisa.

289
00:38:25,261 --> 00:38:28,931
The man who died in the fire
brought her on board.

290
00:38:29,140 --> 00:38:32,226
Where can I wash my clothes?

291
00:38:34,729 --> 00:38:39,525
Here is the washing powder.

292
00:38:39,776 --> 00:38:45,864
Yeah, and here is the softener.

293
00:38:47,117 --> 00:38:49,451
Ask Simon for anything else.

294
00:38:49,828 --> 00:38:53,622
How many people work here?
- Now?

295
00:38:53,832 --> 00:38:59,336
Simon and Abdul,
he's in charge of the cleaning. And...

296
00:39:00,422 --> 00:39:03,757
Scott, Liam, in the engine room.

297
00:39:04,259 --> 00:39:07,678
Josef, you... and me.

298
00:39:07,887 --> 00:39:10,723
The guy that plays basketball?
- Martin?

299
00:39:10,932 --> 00:39:15,894
He's an oceanographer,
he's been here a couple of months, now.

300
00:39:16,104 --> 00:39:20,691
Measuring the number of waves that his us,
every day.

301
00:39:21,651 --> 00:39:25,362
The strength of the sea.

302
00:39:26,406 --> 00:39:30,659
And is the number of waves important?
- I don't know.

303
00:39:31,536 --> 00:39:37,291
I'm not quite sure who he works for,
but it matters to him, certainly.

304
00:39:37,917 --> 00:39:39,543
But...

305
00:39:39,836 --> 00:39:42,963
He doesn't speak too much to us.

306
00:39:43,923 --> 00:39:47,176
Another one who wants to be left alone.

307
00:39:49,512 --> 00:39:52,347
There are quite a few of us.

308
00:39:54,059 --> 00:39:56,602
God makes them.

309
00:40:26,883 --> 00:40:29,843
Cora?
Are you a nun?

310
00:40:31,262 --> 00:40:33,931
You're a nun, aren't you?

311
00:40:34,099 --> 00:40:36,517
That explains everything.

312
00:40:38,269 --> 00:40:44,775
You are Cora,
Little Sister of the Chicken and the Rice.

313
00:40:47,612 --> 00:40:52,449
Cora, Little Sister of the Helpless.

314
00:40:52,867 --> 00:40:58,455
Blessed are the chapped...
are the bed...

315
00:41:09,008 --> 00:41:11,760
What kind of redhead are you?

316
00:41:11,970 --> 00:41:14,388
L'Oreal?

317
00:41:14,597 --> 00:41:15,597
Henna?

318
00:41:16,474 --> 00:41:19,768
For real, with red hair down below it all?

319
00:41:31,698 --> 00:41:36,743
No, you're not a nun. A nun would talk to me.

320
00:41:36,995 --> 00:41:42,416
With their kind natures, and airs of being
above everything they know nothing about.

321
00:41:43,168 --> 00:41:46,545
I'm in your sexy latex hands, Cora.

322
00:41:48,214 --> 00:41:49,590
And...

323
00:41:58,141 --> 00:41:59,433
Your smell.

324
00:42:02,729 --> 00:42:06,899
You don't like Eau de Colognes,
you don't use 'em.

325
00:42:08,234 --> 00:42:12,905
I don't like perfumes either.
Fuckin' perfume. Fuck perfume.

326
00:42:13,323 --> 00:42:17,534
You... You have a clean smell.

327
00:42:18,786 --> 00:42:23,707
Like a...
Like a sweet almond soap.

328
00:42:26,461 --> 00:42:30,255
Maybe that's why I mistook you for a nun.

329
00:42:32,467 --> 00:42:36,011
Why do you call me Cora?
- Oh...

330
00:42:36,804 --> 00:42:40,390
Oh, you don't give out a bit of information,
and...

331
00:42:41,184 --> 00:42:46,104
Not one bit, just absurd lies.
Chicken, rice, apples.

332
00:42:46,689 --> 00:42:51,109
Now you want me to tell all my secrets?
No, sorry. Don't work that way.

333
00:42:51,319 --> 00:42:54,154
Now, you tell me...

334
00:42:54,322 --> 00:42:59,952
some information about yourself,
and I will tell you about Cora.

335
00:43:03,456 --> 00:43:05,457
I'm deaf.

336
00:43:06,626 --> 00:43:11,964
I wear a hearing aid. When I don't want
to listen to something, I turn it off.

337
00:43:12,465 --> 00:43:16,009
And I can hardly hear anything.

338
00:43:23,768 --> 00:43:26,186
Were you born that way?

339
00:43:26,896 --> 00:43:28,772
No.

340
00:43:30,483 --> 00:43:34,528
Can I ask you how it happened?
- No, you can't.

341
00:43:40,034 --> 00:43:44,621
There's this story I read a while ago.

342
00:43:46,291 --> 00:43:54,089
There is this very young,
very pretty nurse, named Cora.

343
00:43:55,008 --> 00:44:00,512
And there is this 15 year-old boy...

344
00:44:00,722 --> 00:44:03,390
who had to have his appendix taken out.

345
00:44:05,143 --> 00:44:11,648
And he was very ashamed
that she had to bathe him, and...

346
00:44:12,525 --> 00:44:15,861
shave him and bedpan him...

347
00:44:19,449 --> 00:44:23,952
Anytime she's in the room he can't talk.

348
00:44:24,203 --> 00:44:29,708
She didn't take him seriously, thinks he's a
child. Treats him like a baby.

349
00:44:29,917 --> 00:44:36,548
Eventually there's complications.
Infection, high temperature...

350
00:44:37,050 --> 00:44:41,261
Then the boy...

351
00:44:43,264 --> 00:44:47,100
gets very weak and...

352
00:44:47,935 --> 00:44:52,814
He's dying and Cora...

353
00:44:53,900 --> 00:44:55,484
sits next to his bed,

354
00:44:56,319 --> 00:45:01,198
talking to him and singing to him,
and hell...

355
00:45:01,783 --> 00:45:07,621
He's dying and she comes up,
real close to him and she says,

356
00:45:07,830 --> 00:45:13,168
"Don't leave me,
don't leave me, don't leave me."

357
00:45:14,379 --> 00:45:16,421
"Don't leave."

358
00:45:16,672 --> 00:45:21,551
And the boy dies.

359
00:45:22,470 --> 00:45:26,390
With her name, Cora, on his lips.

360
00:45:27,975 --> 00:45:33,563
And she realizes that she loves him.

361
00:45:51,707 --> 00:45:53,417
What's that?

362
00:45:55,211 --> 00:45:56,878
A wave measuring device.

363
00:45:58,297 --> 00:46:03,718
Do you know how many waves
the rig has weathered since it was built?

364
00:46:07,974 --> 00:46:10,142
5 million?

365
00:46:10,852 --> 00:46:14,312
Not bad. 25.

366
00:46:14,689 --> 00:46:17,816
See, and without a machine.

367
00:46:18,109 --> 00:46:20,610
Just guessing.

368
00:46:24,449 --> 00:46:28,452
It also measures the water temperature.

369
00:46:28,619 --> 00:46:32,247
Since they stopped drilling,
it's fallen 10 degrees.

370
00:46:32,457 --> 00:46:36,918
Whole colonies of mussels
stuck to the rig legs, have been lost.

371
00:46:37,128 --> 00:46:43,550
Tropical mussels brought by some current
that I haven't been able to identify. Look.

372
00:46:58,858 --> 00:47:05,030
If we didn't know how many waves this thing
could weather we couldn't keep it standing.

373
00:47:05,239 --> 00:47:09,284
Do you think it would be much of a loss?

374
00:47:32,016 --> 00:47:34,851
Simon, for God's sake, what is this shit?

375
00:47:35,353 --> 00:47:38,480
Seems like
we're eating fucking shaving cream.

376
00:47:38,981 --> 00:47:43,109
Liam, do you think this is real food?
What the bloody hell is it?

377
00:47:43,277 --> 00:47:44,486
I hate cheese.

378
00:47:45,154 --> 00:47:47,614
How many times do I got to tell you?

379
00:47:47,865 --> 00:47:54,788
We're going to turn into fucking mice.
- I think it needs a pinch of nutmeg.

380
00:47:56,374 --> 00:48:00,418
Very little nutmeg, Simon.
You always had a problem with that.

381
00:48:02,046 --> 00:48:03,588
Heads up.

382
00:48:03,965 --> 00:48:06,633
Do us some burgers with fried onions.

383
00:48:06,801 --> 00:48:09,010
Is that so difficult?

384
00:48:09,220 --> 00:48:13,098
You peel and onion and fry it.
You do the same with the burger.

385
00:48:13,307 --> 00:48:16,351
Then you put Deep Purple on,
and it's that easy.

386
00:48:17,061 --> 00:48:19,604
Or chops. Or a fucking steak!

387
00:48:19,939 --> 00:48:24,234
I'm heartbroken, but I'm out of Deep Purple.
- What about the Kinks?

388
00:48:24,443 --> 00:48:27,487
Anything like that.
- Def Leopard.

389
00:48:28,531 --> 00:48:31,616
Def Leopard?
They're a band.

390
00:48:31,867 --> 00:48:36,079
Stick you your cockles
in your mussels, Martin.

391
00:48:36,455 --> 00:48:39,833
Something you can sing along to.
- Bleeding salads...

392
00:48:40,876 --> 00:48:45,380
I think it's the best thing I've ever eaten,
in my whole life.

393
00:48:58,144 --> 00:49:02,772
Can you do this everyday?
- Yes, if you want.

394
00:49:03,941 --> 00:49:07,652
Cause you know,
it's important to keep up appearances.

395
00:49:08,321 --> 00:49:12,032
You never know who might show up here.

396
00:49:12,617 --> 00:49:17,370
Queen of England.
Santa Claus.

397
00:49:23,085 --> 00:49:26,588
I've got a headache.
- That's because of the fever.

398
00:49:27,340 --> 00:49:31,384
Your temperature has gone up, today.

399
00:49:32,470 --> 00:49:36,264
You're the one who sends it up.
Sorry.

400
00:49:37,725 --> 00:49:42,270
I'll shut up. I'm not going
to bother you with my foolishness, today.

401
00:49:44,148 --> 00:49:51,196
No? That's a pity.
Just when I was beginning to enjoy myself.

402
00:49:51,572 --> 00:49:54,658
I imagine that you are 15 years old.

403
00:49:56,786 --> 00:50:01,706
I'm exactly 3 times 15.
And you?

404
00:50:04,085 --> 00:50:07,545
I dreamed about you,
a couple of times.

405
00:50:08,047 --> 00:50:11,883
Don't worry. In no way erotic.
- That's a shame.

406
00:50:14,303 --> 00:50:19,808
Don't make me laugh, hurts too much.
What do you dream about, Cora?

407
00:50:21,227 --> 00:50:26,439
You know, in Japan they've
invented this kind of a...

408
00:50:27,149 --> 00:50:35,031
cybernetic pillow that you can
use to program your dreams.

409
00:50:35,241 --> 00:50:39,285
You tell the machine what you want to dream.

410
00:50:39,912 --> 00:50:45,417
Say... what ever you like.
Say, I want to dream of a...

411
00:50:46,377 --> 00:50:49,587
Sean Connery in Highland dress and...

412
00:50:51,298 --> 00:50:56,219
I want it to be at the North Pole,
so I can hide under his kilt.

413
00:50:56,512 --> 00:51:00,765
And... whatever, something like that,
and it works.

414
00:51:01,934 --> 00:51:07,814
And that night you dream you're
at the North Pole under Sean Connery's kilt.

415
00:51:13,529 --> 00:51:16,489
What would you dream about, Cora?

416
00:51:17,783 --> 00:51:18,783
Me?

417
00:51:19,910 --> 00:51:22,370
Not wearing a kilt.

418
00:51:22,663 --> 00:51:26,124
Not wearing anything at all.

419
00:51:27,084 --> 00:51:29,586
Tropical island.

420
00:51:30,880 --> 00:51:34,048
In a huge hammock.

421
00:51:34,592 --> 00:51:39,053
And there's room for both of us.
Are you listening?

422
00:51:39,263 --> 00:51:40,305
Yes.

423
00:51:41,098 --> 00:51:45,560
Our bodies cuddled up close to one another.

424
00:51:45,770 --> 00:51:47,771
Sweat mixing.

425
00:51:48,731 --> 00:51:53,777
Where nothing else matters.

426
00:51:54,862 --> 00:51:57,614
Just you and me, Cora.

427
00:51:58,866 --> 00:52:00,825
Just you and...

428
00:52:34,193 --> 00:52:38,404
Are you looking at me, Cora.
- No.

429
00:52:39,740 --> 00:52:41,699
Are you sure?

430
00:52:43,160 --> 00:52:45,411
I think you were.

431
00:52:47,039 --> 00:52:50,917
You're starting to lie to me, now.

432
00:52:52,211 --> 00:52:54,754
Means you like me a little bit.

433
00:54:31,477 --> 00:54:36,814
I'm reading "Letters of a Portuguese Nun",
again, I know, it's silly.

434
00:54:37,733 --> 00:54:40,652
Reading that book,
I feel like I'm talking to you.

435
00:54:45,866 --> 00:54:47,158
May I?

436
00:54:49,536 --> 00:54:53,247
Well, Ducasse in person.

437
00:54:58,337 --> 00:54:59,712
Wow!

438
00:55:02,091 --> 00:55:03,841
What? Do I look that good?

439
00:55:04,718 --> 00:55:08,846
Better than ever.
It's an improvement.

440
00:55:09,098 --> 00:55:14,936
You remind me of Coyote after
a ton of anvils have fallen on top of him.

441
00:55:18,482 --> 00:55:24,821
Really, you are somewhere
between Coyote and Mr. Magoo.

442
00:55:25,155 --> 00:55:29,200
You're looking handsome yourself,
now that I'm blind.

443
00:55:29,368 --> 00:55:31,369
Thank you.

444
00:55:32,121 --> 00:55:35,248
What have you brought me?
- Open your mouth.

445
00:55:35,457 --> 00:55:37,500
Ah, ha, here we go.

446
00:55:41,505 --> 00:55:42,880
Okay.

447
00:56:00,649 --> 00:56:06,070
Have I ever told you that I love you?
- Yeah, but I know it's just for the sex.

448
00:56:06,739 --> 00:56:08,322
Come on, another.

449
00:56:16,331 --> 00:56:19,667
Did she ask you to come?
- Who?

450
00:56:19,918 --> 00:56:24,380
Simon.
- No, I wanted to.

451
00:56:26,842 --> 00:56:32,346
She didn't say anything to you?
- You know, she doesn't talk much.

452
00:56:33,599 --> 00:56:34,724
What she like?

453
00:56:35,309 --> 00:56:37,518
Is she a looker?
- Go to hell.

454
00:56:38,395 --> 00:56:42,023
Sensitive!
You like her.

455
00:56:42,524 --> 00:56:44,609
You like her, don't you?

456
00:56:44,818 --> 00:56:49,989
I'm thinking of
devoting a day to Ethiopian cooking.

457
00:56:50,199 --> 00:56:54,035
Dried meat and overcooked...
- What are you talking about?

458
00:56:54,244 --> 00:56:55,787
Shut up.

459
00:56:56,497 --> 00:56:58,748
You're changing the subject.

460
00:56:58,957 --> 00:57:02,585
It's okay...
- Josef, really, you are boring me.

461
00:57:02,961 --> 00:57:06,839
Do you want some more?
- It's okay that you like her.

462
00:57:07,049 --> 00:57:09,801
You've been here for a month.

463
00:57:10,010 --> 00:57:14,722
I'm sure she doesn't have
a husband or a boyfriend. It's cool.

464
00:57:15,099 --> 00:57:19,977
Of course. A woman who's free,
without any ties, wouldn't interest you.

465
00:57:25,317 --> 00:57:27,985
Get the fuck out of here.

466
00:57:28,195 --> 00:57:31,030
I have fruit salad or...

467
00:57:31,782 --> 00:57:34,659
Just go.
Get out of here.

468
00:57:51,468 --> 00:57:53,511
Hey, Hanna, Hanna.

469
00:57:54,346 --> 00:57:59,016
Want to see a picture of my family?
- Alright.

470
00:58:00,894 --> 00:58:03,229
That's my wife Shirley. Tom.

471
00:58:03,772 --> 00:58:06,607
Anna, and Amy.

472
00:58:08,735 --> 00:58:10,778
She'll be 2 next month.

473
00:58:12,239 --> 00:58:16,200
She's very pretty.

474
00:58:18,579 --> 00:58:21,414
Kids are great, don't you think?

475
00:58:24,418 --> 00:58:25,418
Yes.

476
00:58:25,669 --> 00:58:28,254
Scott, he's got two daughters.
- Two?

477
00:58:31,508 --> 00:58:34,468
Life is strange.

478
00:58:36,722 --> 00:58:38,014
Yes.

479
00:58:40,184 --> 00:58:41,851
Yes, a lot.

480
00:59:34,363 --> 00:59:36,906
I love you...
- Josef, I love you.

481
00:59:37,115 --> 00:59:40,117
Like that Portuguese nun, even more.

482
00:59:41,620 --> 00:59:44,288
Much more. Come on, call me.

483
00:59:44,498 --> 00:59:47,166
Call me, I know, it's not easy...

484
01:00:09,398 --> 01:00:12,942
It's alright, I'm not sleeping.

485
01:00:13,151 --> 01:00:17,905
I've been waiting for you.

486
01:00:27,165 --> 01:00:28,958
Martin showed me...

487
01:00:29,167 --> 01:00:33,379
I don't want to hear
about anything from the outside.

488
01:00:39,303 --> 01:00:44,682
You tell me something then...
about yourself.

489
01:00:44,891 --> 01:00:46,559
Can you keep a secret?
- Yes.

490
01:00:46,768 --> 01:00:49,437
Are you sure you can keep a secret?
- Yes.

491
01:00:49,688 --> 01:00:50,813
Alright.

492
01:00:51,523 --> 01:00:55,735
I'll tell you but lean in close.
I've got to whisper it in your ear.

493
01:00:59,197 --> 01:01:00,197
One.

494
01:01:01,700 --> 01:01:05,369
Lean in closer so I can tell you.

495
01:01:06,330 --> 01:01:07,371
Closer.

496
01:01:14,129 --> 01:01:16,547
Are you connected?
- Yes.

497
01:01:22,137 --> 01:01:24,805
I can't swim.

498
01:01:32,147 --> 01:01:33,522
Ow.

499
01:01:34,900 --> 01:01:38,194
It's pretty ridiculous, isn't it?

500
01:01:44,117 --> 01:01:47,912
Alright, that's enough.
It's not that funny.

501
01:01:48,830 --> 01:01:50,956
It's just that... with...

502
01:01:53,335 --> 01:01:58,547
With... working here it seems a bit strange.
- What... ow.

503
01:02:01,593 --> 01:02:06,347
People aren't lining up
to jump off the diving board of the oil rig.

504
01:02:06,556 --> 01:02:08,641
It's not an aquatic park, yet.

505
01:02:12,729 --> 01:02:15,147
Never was good in the water.

506
01:02:19,569 --> 01:02:23,322
There was this television series
when I was a kid.

507
01:02:23,532 --> 01:02:27,159
You probably haven't heard of it,
it's about a submarine.

508
01:02:27,369 --> 01:02:31,330
It was called
"Voyage to the Bottom of the Sea".

509
01:02:31,540 --> 01:02:34,917
And there was always these...

510
01:02:35,836 --> 01:02:39,713
There was this great noise
that the submarine made. It went...

511
01:02:40,715 --> 01:02:44,260
I can't do it. It was something like...

512
01:02:47,013 --> 01:02:50,349
I was fascinated with this series, I...

513
01:02:51,810 --> 01:02:58,149
I had nightmares that
there were sea monsters coming after me.

514
01:02:59,109 --> 01:03:04,238
One summer my parents decided,
"We're going to do a beach holiday".

515
01:03:04,406 --> 01:03:06,907
Everything was alright, for a while.

516
01:03:07,784 --> 01:03:13,205
I made sure my parents didn't realize
I wasn't going anywhere near that water.

517
01:03:13,748 --> 01:03:18,627
It terrified me.
I couldn't even go down to the water's edge.

518
01:03:18,837 --> 01:03:22,882
I couldn't even put my toe in,
because I was convinced...

519
01:03:23,049 --> 01:03:26,927
that these monsters were there,
waiting for me.

520
01:03:27,804 --> 01:03:33,058
I was just busy building sand castles.

521
01:03:33,685 --> 01:03:35,769
So, one day...

522
01:03:35,979 --> 01:03:39,815
my dad decides to rent a paddle-boat, and...

523
01:03:41,401 --> 01:03:45,863
he got really angry, because
I wasn't going to go on the paddle-boat,

524
01:03:46,072 --> 01:03:49,909
because I was very busy with my sand castes.

525
01:03:50,118 --> 01:03:55,080
He got furious and
he scooped me up and forced me on it.

526
01:03:56,208 --> 01:03:58,959
And then he started to peddle furiously.

527
01:03:59,669 --> 01:04:03,422
With this kind of uncontrollable rage.

528
01:04:03,632 --> 01:04:09,845
I was trembling, I was sobbing,
and he was saying,

529
01:04:10,096 --> 01:04:16,143
"Spent 5 bucks on this. We're gonna have
a good time if it's the last thing we do!"

530
01:04:16,937 --> 01:04:21,315
Before you know it,
we were pretty far away from the shore.

531
01:04:21,566 --> 01:04:25,819
He stops pedaling, and...

532
01:04:26,446 --> 01:04:31,659
he stands up and he says something like...

533
01:04:32,285 --> 01:04:34,954
I've no idea what he said.

534
01:04:35,705 --> 01:04:37,373
Picks me up...

535
01:04:38,083 --> 01:04:40,334
and he throws me in the water.

536
01:04:41,169 --> 01:04:43,546
I start sinking to the bottom.

537
01:04:43,755 --> 01:04:47,049
I keep going deeper,
and deeper, and deeper down.

538
01:04:49,010 --> 01:04:52,721
And there, I swear, Cora.

539
01:04:53,098 --> 01:04:59,436
There's this big,
black, gelatinous... something.

540
01:04:59,646 --> 01:05:01,939
It had these big bulging eyes, and...

541
01:05:02,899 --> 01:05:05,192
tentacles.

542
01:05:06,319 --> 01:05:09,863
And it saw me.

543
01:05:10,865 --> 01:05:14,660
And it started coming after me.

544
01:05:18,456 --> 01:05:21,750
And that was the last thing I remember.

545
01:05:21,960 --> 01:05:26,589
I woke up in a hospital bed...

546
01:05:34,222 --> 01:05:35,389
You know what?

547
01:05:39,227 --> 01:05:40,894
My father...

548
01:05:42,188 --> 01:05:47,151
When he... when he threw me in the water.

549
01:05:51,990 --> 01:05:54,283
He didn't know how to swim either.

550
01:06:07,839 --> 01:06:11,550
Dr. Sulitzer?
Yes...

551
01:06:13,136 --> 01:06:19,558
Well, we don't have that much to do, so...
No, it's fine. It's okay. Just waiting.

552
01:06:21,227 --> 01:06:25,606
Hanna, the nurse here,
she wants to have a word with you.

553
01:06:25,940 --> 01:06:27,399
Okay.

554
01:06:28,985 --> 01:06:30,361
Hello.

555
01:06:32,280 --> 01:06:35,282
Yes, no... He's stable but he's...

556
01:06:36,368 --> 01:06:39,787
The problem is,
he isn't getting any better, so...

557
01:06:40,246 --> 01:06:45,292
He still is running a high fever.
It comes in waves, morning, mid-afternoon.

558
01:06:47,545 --> 01:06:50,839
I think he should be taken off the oil rig.

559
01:06:52,384 --> 01:06:54,760
No, immediately.

560
01:06:56,680 --> 01:06:58,847
The day after tomorrow?

561
01:06:59,933 --> 01:07:02,393
You'll speak to...

562
01:07:03,853 --> 01:07:06,188
Okay. Good bye.

563
01:07:06,398 --> 01:07:10,150
I think Sulitzer is looking for another job.

564
01:07:10,360 --> 01:07:12,653
Aren't you?

565
01:07:13,029 --> 01:07:18,117
The company can move me to another rig.
Maybe in...

566
01:07:19,119 --> 01:07:23,747
Chile, or Cuba.
Who knows?

567
01:07:24,958 --> 01:07:29,169
Meanwhile, I stay here.
As long as they want.

568
01:07:31,297 --> 01:07:35,676
I get edgy on dry land. I get...

569
01:07:37,387 --> 01:07:40,848
Dizzy.
- The accident?

570
01:07:41,516 --> 01:07:46,103
How did it happen?
- You really want to know that?

571
01:07:49,274 --> 01:07:52,693
They were drilling in ground that's like...

572
01:07:53,945 --> 01:07:56,905
Cheese with holes... Swiss cheese.

573
01:07:57,407 --> 01:08:00,284
There are pockets of gas, down there.

574
01:08:01,411 --> 01:08:06,957
And we hit one.
It's not the first time it's happened.

575
01:08:07,459 --> 01:08:11,128
Could it have been avoided?
- No. No.

576
01:08:11,463 --> 01:08:16,508
Yes, maybe, if we'd
stopped drilling a long time ago. But...

577
01:08:17,677 --> 01:08:22,389
What happened to the man who died,
was no accident.

578
01:08:23,475 --> 01:08:28,771
That man wanted to kill himself.
He threw himself into the flames.

579
01:08:32,066 --> 01:08:33,525
Sorry.

580
01:08:34,402 --> 01:08:36,361
So... and...

581
01:08:37,363 --> 01:08:41,700
Josef, he tried to save him, but...

582
01:08:43,411 --> 01:08:46,622
It all happened so quickly.

583
01:08:48,833 --> 01:08:54,171
We all saw how he threw himself into the...
into the blaze.

584
01:08:55,507 --> 01:09:01,345
We haven't told the company everything.
We let them believe it was an accident.

585
01:09:01,554 --> 01:09:05,974
That man left a wife and 2 kids.

586
01:09:08,019 --> 01:09:11,814
So, what's the point in telling the truth?

587
01:09:12,649 --> 01:09:17,694
Let them believe it was an accident.
That means some money for his family.

588
01:09:19,072 --> 01:09:20,781
And...

589
01:09:22,158 --> 01:09:24,701
Deep down...

590
01:09:25,954 --> 01:09:27,913
everything is an accident.

591
01:09:31,709 --> 01:09:34,753
He never speaks about him.
- Doesn't he?

592
01:09:35,672 --> 01:09:38,215
Well...

593
01:09:49,894 --> 01:09:53,105
Hanna?
- Yes.

594
01:09:54,941 --> 01:09:57,317
What?
- Nothing.

595
01:10:01,656 --> 01:10:03,198
Yes?

596
01:10:03,783 --> 01:10:05,409
Nothin'.
- What?

597
01:10:06,077 --> 01:10:07,953
No, nothin'.

598
01:10:08,454 --> 01:10:09,997
Oh, come on.

599
01:10:12,584 --> 01:10:15,586
Nothing.
- Simon?

600
01:10:15,837 --> 01:10:17,045
What?

601
01:10:18,840 --> 01:10:20,757
Nothing.

602
01:10:21,926 --> 01:10:24,386
No, what?

603
01:10:25,138 --> 01:10:26,680
What?

604
01:10:34,355 --> 01:10:35,355
Hanna?

605
01:10:36,774 --> 01:10:38,984
Hanna?
- Yes.

606
01:10:39,319 --> 01:10:40,944
Look at this!

607
01:10:52,457 --> 01:10:56,168
Remember that you're not 15 years old.

608
01:11:03,217 --> 01:11:05,385
Bodalo.
- What?

609
01:11:06,304 --> 01:11:09,056
What do you think I just said?

610
01:11:10,975 --> 01:11:14,436
Idiot? Dickhead? A little of both?

611
01:11:14,687 --> 01:11:17,606
More or less, yes.

612
01:11:18,733 --> 01:11:22,527
Which language?
- What difference does it make?

613
01:11:22,737 --> 01:11:28,283
Here we go. Aren't you getting tired of
playing the mystery woman act with me?

614
01:11:28,493 --> 01:11:31,745
Do you want more soup?

615
01:11:34,290 --> 01:11:37,876
Come on, I've told you my little miseries.

616
01:11:38,795 --> 01:11:42,839
Tell me something.
No, I'm full up on soup.

617
01:11:50,264 --> 01:11:54,101
Did you like "Letters of a Portuguese Nun"?

618
01:11:58,272 --> 01:12:02,234
I thought you didn't like books,
just chicken and rice.

619
01:12:02,443 --> 01:12:04,528
I used to read.

620
01:12:05,738 --> 01:12:10,742
Yeah, well.
I don't remember it all that well.

621
01:12:11,077 --> 01:12:15,622
Read it ages ago.
It's a short book.

622
01:12:17,583 --> 01:12:22,629
I only read short books.
Don't have patience for long ones.

623
01:12:22,839 --> 01:12:28,176
Gave that book as a present to someone, once.

624
01:12:28,970 --> 01:12:30,345
A woman.

625
01:12:31,514 --> 01:12:35,642
I know I shouldn't have, but I did.
- Why?

626
01:12:39,272 --> 01:12:43,567
Because it was another man's wife.

627
01:12:44,360 --> 01:12:47,237
A man who loved her,

628
01:12:47,447 --> 01:12:49,865
and whom she loved.

629
01:12:51,784 --> 01:12:55,454
And who even I loved.

630
01:13:05,256 --> 01:13:09,301
There's certain things one should never do.

631
01:13:10,053 --> 01:13:13,138
Like what?

632
01:13:13,765 --> 01:13:16,141
One should never...

633
01:13:16,350 --> 01:13:21,855
give a book as a present to someone
who spends too much time alone.

634
01:13:23,149 --> 01:13:27,486
One should never fall in love
with one's best friend's wife.

635
01:13:30,448 --> 01:13:33,867
Above all,
one should never tell one's best friend.

636
01:13:49,842 --> 01:13:56,556
It's terrible to tempt compassion.
It's the last thing I want to arouse in you.

637
01:13:58,434 --> 01:14:00,936
Cora?
- Yes.

638
01:14:03,981 --> 01:14:08,110
How does one live with what has happened?

639
01:14:09,654 --> 01:14:13,156
The consequences.

640
01:14:15,910 --> 01:14:20,372
How does one live with the dead?

641
01:14:25,753 --> 01:14:30,757
I don't know.
You'll have to go on, I suppose.

642
01:14:32,552 --> 01:14:36,221
Everyone keeps on living for the future,
some how.

643
01:14:37,431 --> 01:14:39,266
Or not.

644
01:14:41,060 --> 01:14:46,106
There are those who don't make it through.

645
01:14:54,073 --> 01:14:58,618
A helicopter is coming to fetch you.
Tomorrow, or the day after.

646
01:15:01,122 --> 01:15:05,625
Are you coming with me? Are you?

647
01:15:08,212 --> 01:15:13,049
You gonna hold my hand?
Help me look at myself again?

648
01:15:24,645 --> 01:15:28,857
I've lost at love before

649
01:15:30,067 --> 01:15:34,863
Got mad and closed the door

650
01:15:35,448 --> 01:15:39,492
But you said try just once more

651
01:15:40,244 --> 01:15:42,204
I chose you for the one

652
01:15:42,872 --> 01:15:45,207
Now we're having so much fun

653
01:15:45,583 --> 01:15:47,751
You treated me so kind

654
01:15:48,211 --> 01:15:50,212
I'm about to lose my mind

655
01:15:50,421 --> 01:15:55,217
You make me so very happy

656
01:15:55,676 --> 01:16:02,933
I'm so glad you came into my life

657
01:16:06,354 --> 01:16:10,398
The others were untrue

658
01:16:11,484 --> 01:16:15,612
But when it came to lovin'you

659
01:16:16,364 --> 01:16:20,575
I'd spend my whole life with you

660
01:16:21,244 --> 01:16:23,703
Cause you came and you took control

661
01:16:23,913 --> 01:16:26,248
You touched my very soul

662
01:16:26,499 --> 01:16:28,583
You always showed me that

663
01:16:28,960 --> 01:16:31,086
Loving you is where it's at

664
01:16:31,337 --> 01:16:36,258
You make me so very happy

665
01:16:36,842 --> 01:16:45,475
I'm so glad you came into my life

666
01:16:53,567 --> 01:16:57,279
Don't you like the show?

667
01:16:59,532 --> 01:17:00,991
I've seen it before.

668
01:17:03,452 --> 01:17:06,830
Who do you work for, Martin?

669
01:17:07,331 --> 01:17:09,541
The company.

670
01:17:11,544 --> 01:17:14,671
And the company pays you
to check on the mussels?

671
01:17:15,131 --> 01:17:20,051
The company pays me to measure
the wave impact strength, I told you.

672
01:17:21,012 --> 01:17:23,138
The mussels are my business.

673
01:17:28,894 --> 01:17:33,398
Sometimes I forget that we're out at sea.
- No, we aren't in limbo.

674
01:17:34,025 --> 01:17:37,152
We're up to our necks in water.

675
01:17:38,446 --> 01:17:40,822
Do you know what the problem is?

676
01:17:41,324 --> 01:17:43,408
The people think it's the oil.

677
01:17:43,617 --> 01:17:47,370
But it's not true.
It's the water that we bring out with it.

678
01:17:47,830 --> 01:17:53,501
For millions of years it rubbed shoulders
with the oil, stuck at the bottom of the sea.

679
01:17:53,711 --> 01:17:59,924
You see, when we crack the water from the oil
and return it to the sea, it's shitty water.

680
01:18:00,092 --> 01:18:06,598
It corrupts everything it touches. You know
what's happened to the fish that live here?

681
01:18:07,600 --> 01:18:10,852
Contact with this water
has altered their hormones.

682
01:18:11,062 --> 01:18:15,774
It's delayed spawning. Colder currents
sweep the eggs away before they can hatch.

683
01:18:18,361 --> 01:18:21,571
They're shutting down, anyway.
- Not if I can help it.

684
01:18:21,906 --> 01:18:23,281
What will you do?

685
01:18:23,908 --> 01:18:26,201
This could be used for lots of things.

686
01:18:26,535 --> 01:18:31,498
Use the drilling motors to purge the water.
It's possible to cleanse the water.

687
01:18:31,707 --> 01:18:35,210
What will happen
if nobody takes any notice of you?

688
01:18:40,007 --> 01:18:43,009
Well, I'll keep on measuring waves.

689
01:18:44,095 --> 01:18:45,804
Collecting mussels.

690
01:18:48,057 --> 01:18:52,852
And I'll keep thinking
that something can be done.

691
01:18:58,109 --> 01:19:00,944
I envy you, Martin.

692
01:19:03,989 --> 01:19:11,162
Really, I... I didn't know
there were still people like you about.

693
01:19:12,289 --> 01:19:16,084
I wish you luck.

694
01:20:45,424 --> 01:20:49,344
How did you pass the night?
- The night?

695
01:20:50,596 --> 01:20:55,767
I don't know.
Lousy, I guess.

696
01:20:57,937 --> 01:21:00,480
What time is it?
- 12. Are you hungry?

697
01:21:01,232 --> 01:21:03,358
No.

698
01:21:06,820 --> 01:21:09,197
When I was studying in Dubrovnik,

699
01:21:09,615 --> 01:21:13,034
I always dreaded
when we had to clean the patients.

700
01:21:13,869 --> 01:21:15,662
I felt...

701
01:21:16,705 --> 01:21:19,541
I felt uncomfortable.

702
01:21:19,708 --> 01:21:23,753
Just thinking that they were uncomfortable.

703
01:21:24,672 --> 01:21:26,130
But...

704
01:21:26,298 --> 01:21:31,636
I soon realized that...
people like being clean.

705
01:21:32,930 --> 01:21:36,975
No matter how you do it, or...

706
01:21:38,143 --> 01:21:43,565
or who does it.
They like being in your hands.

707
01:21:45,150 --> 01:21:47,735
They like trusting you with their bodies.

708
01:21:48,654 --> 01:21:53,074
As if they were saying, "It's only a body."

709
01:21:55,119 --> 01:21:59,330
"It's only a body.
You'll never know what I am thinking,

710
01:21:59,498 --> 01:22:03,126
or who I am."

711
01:22:08,966 --> 01:22:11,009
I had a...

712
01:22:12,094 --> 01:22:15,847
I had a friend who studied with me.

713
01:22:18,642 --> 01:22:21,644
We got on very well.

714
01:22:22,271 --> 01:22:26,524
She was...
She was so cheerful.

715
01:22:29,528 --> 01:22:33,573
I've never been cheerful.

716
01:22:36,118 --> 01:22:40,371
I was so proud to be her friend.

717
01:22:41,081 --> 01:22:46,586
We used to read all the same books
and stay up, late into the night,

718
01:22:46,795 --> 01:22:51,382
just talking about them.
The books were always more real than...

719
01:22:51,759 --> 01:22:54,927
More real than anything else.

720
01:22:57,765 --> 01:23:01,643
We lived together during the war, and...

721
01:23:01,894 --> 01:23:05,480
We were 20 years old
when they closed the school.

722
01:23:05,689 --> 01:23:10,860
And we decided to go back to the town
where we were both from.

723
01:23:12,696 --> 01:23:18,242
We couldn't get in touch with our families.
They said terrible things were happening.

724
01:23:19,161 --> 01:23:23,915
But you know, nobody really believed them.
I mean...

725
01:23:25,501 --> 01:23:30,171
People always exaggerate.
It couldn't be true, I mean, war...

726
01:23:31,173 --> 01:23:34,634
Somehow it always happens somewhere else.

727
01:23:36,720 --> 01:23:40,848
So we borrowed a car, she could drive,
and we...

728
01:23:43,769 --> 01:23:45,812
We set off.

729
01:23:46,355 --> 01:23:51,109
Nothing happened on the journey.
We saw...

730
01:23:52,361 --> 01:23:57,532
We saw fires far off, and... dead dogs.

731
01:23:59,785 --> 01:24:01,369
Nothing.

732
01:24:01,620 --> 01:24:04,622
Lots of dead dogs.

733
01:24:07,126 --> 01:24:11,879
We listened to this
cassette of Italian disco music.

734
01:24:16,802 --> 01:24:19,303
And we laughed.

735
01:24:21,598 --> 01:24:25,184
We laughed so much on that journey.

736
01:24:25,477 --> 01:24:30,898
Do you remember, there was this song called,
La Dolce Vita?

737
01:24:31,275 --> 01:24:36,446
It was so stupid. It was...

738
01:24:37,114 --> 01:24:40,116
we're livin' like a Dolce Vita

739
01:24:40,826 --> 01:24:42,910
This time we got it right

740
01:24:43,620 --> 01:24:46,497
we're livin' like a Dolce Vita

741
01:24:46,999 --> 01:24:49,250
Got a dream...

742
01:24:52,087 --> 01:24:57,341
They stopped us just
2 kilometers from the town.

743
01:24:59,720 --> 01:25:02,805
They took us to a hotel.

744
01:25:03,891 --> 01:25:08,352
We thought they just wanted to steal the car.

745
01:25:10,814 --> 01:25:16,027
We were very worried about
how we would explain this to the owner.

746
01:25:18,614 --> 01:25:21,908
It's ridiculous, isn't it?

747
01:25:22,701 --> 01:25:26,954
Your whole life is about to...

748
01:25:28,624 --> 01:25:29,832
change...

749
01:25:31,043 --> 01:25:35,087
And you are worrying about an old Fiat Turbo.

750
01:25:38,425 --> 01:25:41,969
The soldiers were our soldiers.

751
01:25:46,183 --> 01:25:50,770
They were soldiers, they spoke like me,
they spoke my own language.

752
01:25:56,318 --> 01:25:59,237
Some of them were only 18 years old.

753
01:26:01,740 --> 01:26:06,494
I remember, one day,
UN troops were brought in, and...

754
01:26:07,371 --> 01:26:12,500
We thought that day
that they were going to take us out of there.

755
01:26:14,545 --> 01:26:16,462
No.

756
01:26:17,881 --> 01:26:22,176
Voices like yours, Josef.

757
01:26:22,386 --> 01:26:24,428
Talking like you.

758
01:26:28,725 --> 01:26:32,019
I remember that one of them...

759
01:26:33,021 --> 01:26:37,859
apologized all the time.
He would apologize...

760
01:26:38,569 --> 01:26:40,653
while smiling.

761
01:26:42,656 --> 01:26:46,242
If you can imagine that they...

762
01:26:46,618 --> 01:26:52,540
rape you, time and again, and whisper
in your ears, so only you can hear...

763
01:26:52,749 --> 01:26:54,792
I'm sorry, I'm so sorry.

764
01:26:55,460 --> 01:26:57,420
Forgive me.

765
01:27:01,091 --> 01:27:04,760
There were 15 of us women.

766
01:27:05,178 --> 01:27:10,057
Sometimes more. We knew that when
the food ran out, they'd kill some of us.

767
01:27:10,976 --> 01:27:14,896
They made a woman kill her daughter.

768
01:27:16,064 --> 01:27:20,693
They put a gun in her hand
and her finger on the trigger.

769
01:27:20,903 --> 01:27:28,159
They put the barrel of the gun in the girl's
vagina. They made her pull that trigger.

770
01:27:29,995 --> 01:27:34,790
Saying something like,
now you're not going to be a grandmother.

771
01:27:35,584 --> 01:27:37,793
Something like that.

772
01:27:38,003 --> 01:27:44,634
So, the woman died soon after, of sorrow.

773
01:27:48,180 --> 01:27:51,349
One day dawned and she had died of sorrow.

774
01:27:53,268 --> 01:27:57,480
Know what they did
to the ones who dared to scream?

775
01:27:57,814 --> 01:27:59,941
They said...

776
01:28:01,818 --> 01:28:05,655
"Now we are really going to
give you reasons for screaming."

777
01:28:05,864 --> 01:28:11,285
And they made hundreds of cuts
all over their bodies, with a knife.

778
01:28:11,745 --> 01:28:17,541
And they rubbed salt in the wounds and
sewed up deeper cuts with sewing needles.

779
01:28:19,127 --> 01:28:23,005
That's what they did to my friend.

780
01:28:26,885 --> 01:28:30,346
And I couldn't...

781
01:28:30,931 --> 01:28:35,017
They wouldn't let me clean her wounds, so...

782
01:28:35,644 --> 01:28:37,770
She slowly bled to death.

783
01:28:41,858 --> 01:28:47,196
It was just so...
It was so slowly.

784
01:28:48,657 --> 01:28:52,576
And the blood ran down her arms,
and her legs.

785
01:28:54,246 --> 01:28:57,498
I just prayed that she would die quickly.

786
01:28:57,708 --> 01:29:01,043
I counted the screams.

787
01:29:01,253 --> 01:29:04,380
The moans, I measured...
I measured the pain.

788
01:29:06,925 --> 01:29:13,806
And I thought...
"She can't suffer anymore."

789
01:29:16,810 --> 01:29:18,769
"Now she'll die."

790
01:29:20,147 --> 01:29:24,525
"Now. Please."

791
01:29:26,194 --> 01:29:28,279
"The very next minute, please."

792
01:32:05,645 --> 01:32:07,730
What was her name?

793
01:32:08,732 --> 01:32:10,691
Your friend.

794
01:32:12,277 --> 01:32:14,069
What was her name?

795
01:32:16,156 --> 01:32:18,824
Hanna.

796
01:33:17,968 --> 01:33:20,135
Hanna?

797
01:33:23,890 --> 01:33:43,575
Hanna!

798
01:35:37,857 --> 01:35:38,857
Josef.

799
01:35:39,734 --> 01:35:42,778
Your bag.
- That's not mine.

800
01:35:42,987 --> 01:35:45,280
It's yours.

801
01:38:58,433 --> 01:39:01,435
Would you come with me?

802
01:39:05,148 --> 01:39:10,110
Did you have a good trip? Do sit down.
- Yes, thank you.

803
01:39:11,571 --> 01:39:15,699
Is this your first time in Copenhagen?
- Yes, it's quite nice.

804
01:39:15,908 --> 01:39:18,201
It's lovely.

805
01:39:19,329 --> 01:39:22,205
What do you need from me?

806
01:39:24,167 --> 01:39:29,963
Well, I've been thinking about what
I would say to you this entire journey.

807
01:39:30,673 --> 01:39:33,175
I'm not quite sure.

808
01:39:33,635 --> 01:39:38,430
As I told you on the phone,
I met Hanna when she was my nurse.

809
01:39:38,848 --> 01:39:43,185
I never really... got to see her.

810
01:39:43,394 --> 01:39:47,898
Do you want a photo of her,
see if she's as beautiful as her voice?

811
01:39:49,651 --> 01:39:51,943
No.
- No.

812
01:39:52,153 --> 01:39:57,991
You wouldn't have come
all this way just for a photograph.

813
01:39:58,201 --> 01:40:01,953
I was Hanna's councilor for 2 years.

814
01:40:02,246 --> 01:40:05,666
Since then I receive
a phone call, from time to time.

815
01:40:06,167 --> 01:40:12,047
She doesn't speak, she doesn't say anything,
but I know it's her, I know she's alive.

816
01:40:12,256 --> 01:40:18,720
Why doesn't she say anything?
- That's between Hanna and me.

817
01:40:20,682 --> 01:40:25,936
She... she told me something.

818
01:40:26,771 --> 01:40:31,566
About what happened... in the hotel.

819
01:40:32,610 --> 01:40:37,406
She must have trusted you.
- But I know...

820
01:40:37,699 --> 01:40:41,660
I know, don't ask me how or why,
but I know...

821
01:40:41,869 --> 01:40:45,914
There's something she didn't tell me.
And many things...

822
01:40:46,457 --> 01:40:49,835
she didn't tell me, and I want to know.

823
01:40:50,211 --> 01:40:55,507
And you want me to tell you.
Haven't you had your ration of horror?

824
01:40:55,967 --> 01:40:57,801
What do you want?

825
01:40:58,261 --> 01:41:03,515
What do you really want? Didn't you read
the newspaper during those 10 years of war?

826
01:41:06,644 --> 01:41:10,605
What? I don't know.

827
01:41:13,443 --> 01:41:17,070
I think I want...

828
01:41:17,488 --> 01:41:21,700
to spend the rest of my life with her.

829
01:41:22,076 --> 01:41:25,412
Oh, the rest of your life.

830
01:41:26,122 --> 01:41:28,665
How romantic.

831
01:41:29,917 --> 01:41:35,172
The rest of your life with a refugee
from a war that everybody has forgotten?

832
01:41:35,548 --> 01:41:38,759
With a woman you've never even seen?

833
01:41:39,927 --> 01:41:43,638
With a woman that you
only know has suffered things...

834
01:41:43,848 --> 01:41:47,100
neither your nor I could bear?

835
01:41:49,312 --> 01:41:54,816
Have you ever thought that what Hanna needs,
most of all, is to be left alone?

836
01:41:55,359 --> 01:42:00,155
Yeah. Yeah, I've thought about that.

837
01:42:01,115 --> 01:42:05,744
But... I know she needs me.

838
01:42:07,872 --> 01:42:09,456
And I need her.

839
01:42:09,916 --> 01:42:12,375
I know it.

840
01:42:18,049 --> 01:42:20,425
Come with me.

841
01:42:33,439 --> 01:42:35,899
This is Hanna Amiran.

842
01:42:37,360 --> 01:42:40,612
Here is everything you want to know.

843
01:42:41,447 --> 01:42:44,699
But, even if you
really feel the way you say you do,

844
01:42:44,909 --> 01:42:48,036
does that give you
the right to see this tape?

845
01:42:48,538 --> 01:42:51,164
Without her consent?

846
01:42:52,667 --> 01:42:55,627
Do you know how many Hannas there are here?

847
01:42:56,045 --> 01:43:00,590
Do you know how much blood?
How many deaths?

848
01:43:02,635 --> 01:43:06,304
Do you know how much hatred these tapes hold?

849
01:43:09,433 --> 01:43:13,728
Do you know why we record them?
- No, why?

850
01:43:14,814 --> 01:43:20,235
Before the Holocaust, Adolph Hitler
called his collaborators together,

851
01:43:20,361 --> 01:43:25,240
and in order to convince them
that he could get away with his plan,

852
01:43:25,449 --> 01:43:30,078
he asked them, "Who remembers
the extermination of the Armenians?"

853
01:43:30,288 --> 01:43:31,830
That's what he said.

854
01:43:33,332 --> 01:43:34,416
30 years later,

855
01:43:34,709 --> 01:43:40,297
nobody remembered the million Armenians
exterminated in the cruelest possible way.

856
01:43:41,507 --> 01:43:43,091
10 years later...

857
01:43:43,467 --> 01:43:46,928
Who remembers what happened in the Balkans?

858
01:43:47,388 --> 01:43:50,348
The survivors.

859
01:43:52,310 --> 01:43:57,856
Those who managed,
by some twist of fate, to tell it.

860
01:43:58,816 --> 01:44:01,902
If they can.

861
01:44:03,362 --> 01:44:05,572
Those who are ashamed...

862
01:44:06,949 --> 01:44:10,577
of having survived.

863
01:44:11,245 --> 01:44:12,412
Like Hanna.

864
01:44:13,915 --> 01:44:17,250
That's the irony of it,
if you can call it that.

865
01:44:17,501 --> 01:44:22,088
The shame they feel
for having managed to survive.

866
01:44:23,966 --> 01:44:25,717
And that shame,

867
01:44:26,344 --> 01:44:31,389
which is greater than the pain,
which is bigger than anything else,

868
01:44:33,225 --> 01:44:36,061
can last forever.

869
01:44:54,330 --> 01:44:57,540
I believe I have a photograph of Hanna,
somewhere.

870
01:45:25,194 --> 01:45:27,654
Hanna.

871
01:45:32,743 --> 01:45:35,704
I knew you were blond.

872
01:45:37,999 --> 01:45:40,959
I came to bring you your backpack.

873
01:45:41,127 --> 01:45:42,168
Thanks.

874
01:45:44,255 --> 01:45:47,340
You have done it, now you can go.

875
01:45:53,514 --> 01:45:58,518
I... I took a bar of soap.
Hope you don't mind.

876
01:45:58,728 --> 01:46:01,813
No, I have lots.

877
01:46:07,987 --> 01:46:10,488
It's a nice scar that you've got.

878
01:46:12,867 --> 01:46:19,080
Yeah, well, they said it won't look so bad,
after a while.

879
01:46:21,500 --> 01:46:26,838
They also told me that the nurse
that took care of me did a real good job.

880
01:46:27,006 --> 01:46:28,631
Good.

881
01:46:31,343 --> 01:46:33,678
They shut down the rig.

882
01:46:35,723 --> 01:46:40,268
Where is everyone going?
- They offered us work in Chile.

883
01:46:41,062 --> 01:46:44,981
Simon is going to go back
and try the restaurant business.

884
01:46:45,566 --> 01:46:49,527
Chile.
- I haven't decided what to do.

885
01:46:50,654 --> 01:46:52,906
Still thinking about it.

886
01:46:54,366 --> 01:46:55,408
Good.

887
01:46:57,078 --> 01:47:01,581
I thought... you and I...

888
01:47:02,666 --> 01:47:07,128
Maybe we could go away somewhere, together.

889
01:47:07,630 --> 01:47:10,924
One of these days. Today.

890
01:47:12,051 --> 01:47:15,553
Right now.

891
01:47:18,057 --> 01:47:20,141
Come with me, Hanna.

892
01:47:24,730 --> 01:47:27,857
No, I...

893
01:47:28,692 --> 01:47:32,403
I don't think that's going to be possible.
- Why not?

894
01:47:41,163 --> 01:47:45,416
Because I think that if we go away,
to someplace together...

895
01:47:45,876 --> 01:47:49,337
I am afraid that, one day...

896
01:47:49,964 --> 01:47:51,798
Maybe not today...

897
01:47:53,425 --> 01:47:57,262
Maybe not tomorrow either,
but one day, suddenly...

898
01:48:01,267 --> 01:48:05,603
I may begin to cry and cry so much
that nothing and nobody can stop me.

899
01:48:05,855 --> 01:48:09,440
And the tears will fill the room,
I won't be able to breathe,

900
01:48:09,650 --> 01:48:14,279
and I will pull you down with me,
and we'll both drown.

901
01:48:15,447 --> 01:48:17,115
I'll learn how to swim.

902
01:48:21,579 --> 01:48:23,121
I swear.

903
01:48:25,040 --> 01:48:26,916
I'll learn how to swim.

904
01:49:59,635 --> 01:50:02,178
I left a long time ago.

905
01:50:02,388 --> 01:50:08,685
Only sometimes, in these Sunday mornings,
when he's buying the papers and the bread.

906
01:50:09,144 --> 01:50:14,565
And she hears her children shouting from the
house next door, where they've gone to play.

907
01:50:14,775 --> 01:50:18,027
Yes, yes she has 2 children now.

908
01:50:18,237 --> 01:50:20,071
My brothers.

909
01:50:20,281 --> 01:50:25,576
These cool and sunny winter mornings
when she has the house to herself.

910
01:50:25,786 --> 01:50:29,706
And she feels strange and fragile and empty.

911
01:50:29,915 --> 01:50:33,835
And for a moment
she doesn't know it all has been a dream.

912
01:50:34,878 --> 01:50:40,550
Then I come back to her
and she cuddles me and strokes my hair.

913
01:50:40,759 --> 01:50:46,014
And nothing, nothing at all what happened
will ever come between us.

914
01:50:46,223 --> 01:50:51,561
But I can hear the children coming back.
I go away.

915
01:50:51,729 --> 01:50:54,063
I'm far away, now.

916
01:50:54,273 --> 01:50:58,526
Perhaps, I'll never come back.
