00:02:26,520 --> 00:02:27,475
Who is that?

12
00:02:31,400 --> 00:02:35,029
That child! We won't have
any fruit left

13
00:03:51,920 --> 00:03:53,558
Auntie

14
00:05:00,240 --> 00:05:05,792
The orchard is private property,
bought and paid for

15
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:10,039
lt will have to be fenced in
if we're to save any fruit

16
00:05:11,920 --> 00:05:15,549
There are so many thieves about

17
00:05:16,120 --> 00:05:18,156
That wretched girl of Hori's

18
00:05:19,400 --> 00:05:22,358
She's always taking our fruit

19
00:05:22,600 --> 00:05:25,717
You have to keep
your eyes peeled for her

20
00:05:26,840 --> 00:05:32,358
l just saw her taking a guava
and who knows what else?

21
00:05:32,560 --> 00:05:35,552
-Tell her off
-What's the use?

22
00:05:37,840 --> 00:05:42,436
She'll take no notice of me,
she's not my daughter

23
00:05:42,640 --> 00:05:47,156
lt doesn't matter what we say;
it's up to her mother

24
00:05:47,920 --> 00:05:52,550
The mother will be shocked when
she's shamed before the village

25
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:57,357
That child is being badly brought up

26
00:05:57,720 --> 00:05:58,550
Can l help?

27
00:06:04,840 --> 00:06:08,628
-lt's too heavy for you
-l can manage

28
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:05,073
Did l forget you, Durga? Wait

29
00:07:27,600 --> 00:07:28,953
Come here

30
00:07:29,160 --> 00:07:32,550
She's doing no harm; let her stay

31
00:07:32,840 --> 00:07:35,559
Why should she watch you eat?

32
00:07:36,240 --> 00:07:40,791
Run along to your mother, dear

33
00:07:46,520 --> 00:07:50,115
Did you take something
from Mrs. Mukherji's garden?

34
00:07:51,680 --> 00:07:53,557
What are you hiding?

35
00:08:05,160 --> 00:08:07,549
Take them back to her

36
00:08:08,160 --> 00:08:11,038
Then come back and sweep the yard

37
00:09:01,440 --> 00:09:03,908
You're spoiling Durga

38
00:09:04,600 --> 00:09:06,989
-l don't understand
-You do

39
00:09:07,600 --> 00:09:08,919
You eat the fruit

40
00:09:10,760 --> 00:09:13,320
The fruit Durga brings you

41
00:09:15,240 --> 00:09:19,711
You should know better,
shouldn't you?

42
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:24,879
You think you can do as you please,
living with us

43
00:09:27,760 --> 00:09:31,548
-l know you
-What do you mean?

44
00:09:31,840 --> 00:09:36,118
You know. Don't you take things
from the kitchen?

45
00:09:36,600 --> 00:09:38,352
Oil, salt, chillies

46
00:09:38,640 --> 00:09:42,110
Shall l look in your box?

47
00:09:42,600 --> 00:09:44,556
Lost your tongue?

48
00:09:45,240 --> 00:09:50,189
lt's got to stop.
Maybe you'd better go somewhere else

49
00:09:53,440 --> 00:09:58,958
l've stood it for eight years;
my patience is exhausted

50
00:09:59,760 --> 00:10:03,912
You spoil my daughter
and l get the blame for it

51
00:10:41,600 --> 00:10:44,558
lt's too much in my old age

52
00:10:50,800 --> 00:10:52,791
Where are you going?

53
00:11:13,960 --> 00:11:14,790
Auntie

54
00:11:22,080 --> 00:11:25,789
Leave her alone, Durga

55
00:11:50,600 --> 00:11:52,556
Did you hear me?

56
00:11:54,520 --> 00:11:57,114
What else did l tell you to do?

57
00:13:46,480 --> 00:13:51,110
-Where have you been, Auntie lndir?
-l was staying with Raghu

58
00:13:51,320 --> 00:13:55,677
Then this morning
l heard that Hori has...

59
00:13:56,000 --> 00:14:00,039
On my way l found this child
coming to fetch me

60
00:14:00,600 --> 00:14:02,875
So we met

61
00:14:03,080 --> 00:14:06,709
Go and see your lovely new nephew

62
00:14:28,560 --> 00:14:31,028
Let me see his face properly

63
00:14:40,680 --> 00:14:43,558
What a little darling

64
00:15:28,600 --> 00:15:30,636
What are you cooking?

65
00:15:32,600 --> 00:15:34,750
Pilau, korma... fine dishes

66
00:15:35,080 --> 00:15:38,959
One day you shall cook them,
or have you forgotten how?

67
00:15:39,160 --> 00:15:41,071
l've forgotten

68
00:15:41,320 --> 00:15:46,713
A pity; l thought we might
celebrate our son's birth

69
00:15:49,600 --> 00:15:54,355
-What about money?
-l shall start work next month

70
00:15:56,400 --> 00:16:00,359
Landlord Ray has promised a job,
doing his accounts

71
00:16:00,600 --> 00:16:02,556
Did you ask about pay?

72
00:16:02,760 --> 00:16:06,719
No, but l shan't slave
as a rent collector for ever

73
00:16:06,920 --> 00:16:12,552
The money from that job and the fees
for religious ceremonies...

74
00:16:12,760 --> 00:16:17,356
...will keep the family going for now

75
00:16:17,600 --> 00:16:20,194
Surely you can understand that

76
00:16:24,080 --> 00:16:28,517
Lucky January: the boy was born
and you got a job

77
00:16:28,760 --> 00:16:32,355
That's why l think we should
spend a little...

78
00:16:32,600 --> 00:16:36,036
...and celebrate his birth in style

79
00:16:37,600 --> 00:16:44,039
lt's good for our prestige, and
people will praise your cooking

80
00:16:47,320 --> 00:16:51,836
-Will you be paid regularly?
-Why not? Ray is a good man

81
00:16:53,080 --> 00:16:56,959
You're no judge of that;
you've always been cheated

82
00:16:59,160 --> 00:17:01,037
What do you mean?

83
00:17:01,600 --> 00:17:03,875
What about our garden?

84
00:17:04,600 --> 00:17:08,957
They said my brother owed them
money when he was alive

85
00:17:09,160 --> 00:17:11,071
The garden paid off the debt

86
00:17:11,760 --> 00:17:17,710
lf we had the orchard now
we wouldn't go hungry

87
00:17:17,920 --> 00:17:23,836
You should hear what they say
when Durga takes a few guavas

88
00:17:24,600 --> 00:17:28,718
What do such people matter?
l am a scholar

89
00:17:28,920 --> 00:17:31,798
Who cares about that here?

90
00:17:32,000 --> 00:17:34,992
Listen to what l have in mind

91
00:17:35,440 --> 00:17:39,877
l am going to write original plays
and poems

92
00:17:40,080 --> 00:17:42,719
l'll soon be in great demand

93
00:17:44,000 --> 00:17:48,516
The travelling players need
new material

94
00:17:48,760 --> 00:17:52,230
Most writers are merely
rehashing old stories

95
00:17:52,520 --> 00:17:55,398
lf their stuff is popular...

96
00:17:56,000 --> 00:17:59,549
...shouldn't my stuff be
even more popular?

97
00:18:00,000 --> 00:18:01,718
Of course

98
00:18:02,320 --> 00:18:07,314
And as a scholar you'll be
respected in the village

99
00:18:10,720 --> 00:18:12,756
And you will teach the boy

100
00:18:14,560 --> 00:18:16,994
lt's not long to the festival

101
00:18:19,120 --> 00:18:21,873
A good match will be found for Durga

102
00:18:23,160 --> 00:18:28,359
We'll have two good meals a day
and new clothes twice a year

103
00:18:29,160 --> 00:18:34,871
That's how it will be; my ancestors
were writers, after all

104
00:18:35,240 --> 00:18:38,198
l keep alive the family tradition

105
00:18:38,400 --> 00:18:44,350
ln two years we'll be living
in comfort, free of debt

106
00:18:44,600 --> 00:18:48,639
The house will be repaired...
and no more spinach every day

107
00:19:23,840 --> 00:19:29,358
Wake up, Apu; it's time to go
to school

108
00:19:39,080 --> 00:19:40,399
Durga, wake Apu

109
00:19:40,600 --> 00:19:43,558
l can't make him stir

110
00:19:47,600 --> 00:19:53,596
There's not much milk; do you
feed the cow properly?

111
00:21:51,160 --> 00:21:55,995
How many more times must you
moisten your duster?

112
00:21:57,360 --> 00:21:58,839
Sit down!

113
00:22:04,920 --> 00:22:08,879
-What do you want?
-Puffed rice, please

114
00:22:09,080 --> 00:22:11,753
Hand over the money, then

115
00:23:11,480 --> 00:23:13,869
You've netted a fine catch

116
00:23:14,400 --> 00:23:16,868
How many pupils now?

117
00:23:17,080 --> 00:23:20,959
The new boy makes nine

118
00:23:21,160 --> 00:23:23,958
The nine gems

119
00:23:25,240 --> 00:23:26,832
What are you laughing at?

120
00:23:29,920 --> 00:23:33,629
Go on like that and you'll
end up behind a plough

121
00:23:35,160 --> 00:23:40,029
-You were saying, sir?
-Have you seen any good plays?

122
00:23:40,240 --> 00:23:44,028
l did see one company

123
00:23:44,240 --> 00:23:46,037
Gupe, what are you doing?

124
00:23:47,760 --> 00:23:53,392
The next village has booked
a very good company

125
00:23:53,600 --> 00:23:54,749
l'll thrash you

126
00:23:54,960 --> 00:23:58,350
They thought they'd be one up on us,

127
00:23:58,560 --> 00:24:02,348
but they reckoned without me

128
00:24:02,600 --> 00:24:08,357
l've booked the finest company
anyone's ever seen

129
00:24:08,600 --> 00:24:11,114
May l have some of your oil?

130
00:24:14,600 --> 00:24:18,639
l've not put you down for
a contribution...

131
00:24:18,840 --> 00:24:21,752
...but l'm sure you won't forget
my needs

132
00:24:23,480 --> 00:24:26,358
Don't forget your friend Boidyonath

133
00:24:28,760 --> 00:24:30,716
Wait, Mr. Chakrabarti

134
00:24:34,680 --> 00:24:35,874
The drummer...

135
00:24:36,080 --> 00:24:38,389
...of the company...

136
00:24:38,600 --> 00:24:40,556
...sounds like thunder

137
00:24:49,600 --> 00:24:54,549
Sude, come here and bring
your slate with you

138
00:24:54,760 --> 00:24:56,796
Bring me his slate

139
00:25:03,480 --> 00:25:07,359
So this is what you've been up to

140
00:25:18,840 --> 00:25:22,037
Hold out your hand

141
00:25:59,320 --> 00:26:03,552
What are you doing?

142
00:26:07,400 --> 00:26:10,949
-What are you doing in the kitchen?
-Nothing

143
00:26:11,160 --> 00:26:14,550
Nothing? Didn't l see you take
something?

144
00:26:14,840 --> 00:26:18,389
l have no chillies, so l thought
l'd take a couple

145
00:26:22,600 --> 00:26:24,352
Why didn't you ask?

146
00:26:46,600 --> 00:26:50,149
Durga, come and help me
when you are free

147
00:27:02,160 --> 00:27:08,030
Girls of your age should help about
the house, cooking, washing up...

148
00:27:09,560 --> 00:27:13,030
...performing religious rites

149
00:27:15,760 --> 00:27:18,433
ls it right to skylark about all day?

150
00:27:20,760 --> 00:27:23,558
You must learn to cook, mustn't you?

151
00:27:37,160 --> 00:27:40,550
Are you feverish again today?

152
00:27:43,320 --> 00:27:45,550
Remember to drink
your herbal tincture

153
00:28:04,600 --> 00:28:09,674
-l'm hungry
-Haven't you had your puffed rice?

154
00:28:15,360 --> 00:28:19,069
There is rice for you in the bowl
ask Durga to give you some.

155
00:28:28,200 --> 00:28:29,758
Help me up

156
00:28:35,080 --> 00:28:37,196
My back is stiff

157
00:28:37,400 --> 00:28:42,872
-How are you these days?
-Who cares about an old woman?

158
00:28:43,920 --> 00:28:45,990
Just look at this

159
00:28:51,520 --> 00:28:58,232
-lt's my shawl for the evenings
-l'll buy you a new one soon

160
00:29:05,920 --> 00:29:08,309
Can l have a light?

161
00:29:13,960 --> 00:29:18,351
We can't afford so much tobacco

162
00:29:29,160 --> 00:29:32,789
Did you ask for your pay today?

163
00:29:33,000 --> 00:29:39,553
Landlord Ray has his own troubles.
l might risk my job if l ask now

164
00:29:39,760 --> 00:29:44,550
There must be other jobs
in the town

165
00:29:44,760 --> 00:29:47,718
You haven't been paid
for three months

166
00:29:47,920 --> 00:29:49,478
lt's the first time

167
00:29:49,680 --> 00:29:55,357
You're happy to let things slide

168
00:29:57,280 --> 00:30:01,796
Durga has not been well;
she needs medicine and better food

169
00:30:02,000 --> 00:30:04,798
Apu needs new clothes;
he's going to school in rags

170
00:30:16,840 --> 00:30:20,958
The house needs repairing,
debts must be repaid

171
00:30:21,160 --> 00:30:26,553
We owe Mrs. Mukherji five rupees;
she'll press for repayment

172
00:30:27,600 --> 00:30:29,477
You must do something

173
00:30:47,160 --> 00:30:49,116
You won't tell mother?

174
00:30:54,720 --> 00:30:56,278
She'll hear you

175
00:31:33,120 --> 00:31:34,235
The sweet-seller

176
00:31:44,760 --> 00:31:50,198
Halva, fudge, coconut cakes

177
00:31:52,400 --> 00:31:53,674
Ask father for money

178
00:31:54,600 --> 00:31:55,555
You ask

179
00:32:16,280 --> 00:32:20,876
ls he asking for money?
Don't pander to him

180
00:32:24,480 --> 00:32:25,595
None today?

181
00:32:30,760 --> 00:32:32,990
Let's follow him to the others

182
00:34:06,680 --> 00:34:08,796
Let me see what you've got.

183
00:34:12,120 --> 00:34:15,795
Coming to play with us, Durga?

184
00:34:16,800 --> 00:34:21,635
Coming? lf not, go home,
l'll be back soon

185
00:34:32,440 --> 00:34:34,795
Like a sweet, Durga?

186
00:34:35,000 --> 00:34:41,553
Don't give them any. lf they want
sweets, they should buy their own

187
00:34:48,400 --> 00:34:50,550
Tunu, come and play

188
00:35:00,360 --> 00:35:01,918
What lovely beads

189
00:35:04,520 --> 00:35:06,875
-Who gave them to you?
-Father

190
00:35:08,520 --> 00:35:11,478
Let me help you

191
00:36:54,520 --> 00:37:00,470
What have things come to, when an
old woman has to patch her shawl?

192
00:37:01,680 --> 00:37:03,477
Durga, come here

193
00:37:16,520 --> 00:37:18,988
You know it's time to do your hair

194
00:37:38,080 --> 00:37:41,789
-Can you plait four strands?
-Don't move your head

195
00:37:44,000 --> 00:37:45,558
Ranu can

196
00:37:46,920 --> 00:37:53,109
What dry hair, and we have no oil.
Never mind four-stranded plaits

197
00:37:55,520 --> 00:37:59,479
Some people are coming to see
if Ranu is a suitable bride

198
00:38:00,240 --> 00:38:01,468
Who are they?

199
00:38:36,200 --> 00:38:37,349
Ever seen a train?

200
00:38:38,520 --> 00:38:39,669
Don't lie

201
00:38:39,880 --> 00:38:43,555
Do you know
where the railway line is?

202
00:38:44,000 --> 00:38:47,959
Over the big meadow,
beyond the rice fields

203
00:38:48,400 --> 00:38:49,879
Let's go there

204
00:38:58,520 --> 00:39:03,116
Now write the word... wealth

205
00:39:39,840 --> 00:39:42,070
Were you good at school?

206
00:39:54,320 --> 00:39:59,713
You're so tiny; do the other boys
tease you?

207
00:40:34,760 --> 00:40:37,877
l'm not surprised he's left it

208
00:40:39,840 --> 00:40:45,790
He gets nothing but rice,
but what else can l afford?

209
00:40:48,720 --> 00:40:50,312
Wash your face

210
00:40:57,800 --> 00:40:58,755
Where's Durga?

211
00:41:00,760 --> 00:41:03,069
Shall l fetch her toy-box?

212
00:41:05,320 --> 00:41:07,880
She's not well brought up

213
00:41:09,240 --> 00:41:10,593
What has happened?

214
00:41:10,800 --> 00:41:13,758
Durga has stolen Tunu's beads

215
00:41:20,080 --> 00:41:24,119
Don't look astonished; she is
an accomplished thief

216
00:41:28,160 --> 00:41:30,720
Her father bought the beads in town

217
00:41:31,240 --> 00:41:32,673
Tunu showed Durga

218
00:41:34,520 --> 00:41:36,875
This morning the beads had vanished

219
00:41:46,000 --> 00:41:51,438
Durga hasn't been back; anyway,
are you sure she took them?

220
00:41:53,520 --> 00:41:56,080
Are you suggesting we've invented it?

221
00:41:56,560 --> 00:42:00,314
-The string could have broken
-lt didn't

222
00:42:00,840 --> 00:42:02,956
We've searched everywhere

223
00:42:15,520 --> 00:42:17,715
Did you take Tunu's beads?

224
00:42:19,360 --> 00:42:20,918
Didn't you?

225
00:42:22,520 --> 00:42:24,476
She's a liar

226
00:42:26,080 --> 00:42:29,470
Where do you suppose she got
that fruit?

227
00:42:38,520 --> 00:42:42,354
What's the matter? What's going on?

228
00:43:06,520 --> 00:43:11,958
The garden isn't ours;
it's wrong to take the fruit

229
00:43:12,160 --> 00:43:17,280
But how can you accuse her of
stealing something bought for money?

230
00:43:17,600 --> 00:43:20,592
She's a child.
Fruit has no name on it

231
00:43:21,080 --> 00:43:24,959
Listen to that! The rupees l lent you
had no name on...

232
00:43:25,160 --> 00:43:26,718
...had they?

233
00:43:27,240 --> 00:43:31,472
When will you pay them back?
l can't wait forever

234
00:43:34,520 --> 00:43:37,876
When you find the beads
l hope you'll return them

235
00:43:46,840 --> 00:43:53,109
Our fruit disappears. l complain
and the mother says:

236
00:43:53,320 --> 00:43:57,871
Suppose the children take it;
fruit has no name on it

237
00:43:58,080 --> 00:44:02,039
Like mother, like daughter:
a pair of thieves

238
00:44:09,400 --> 00:44:10,355
Come here

239
00:46:29,240 --> 00:46:32,118
Tell Durga to come in for her meal

240
00:46:51,320 --> 00:46:55,871
Then came an ogress,
hobble, cackle, gobble

241
00:46:56,520 --> 00:47:03,039
''l smell humans!
Who is awake in my temple?''

242
00:47:04,320 --> 00:47:08,871
Iue Lotus Prince kept guard
while Red Lotus Prince slept

243
00:47:10,400 --> 00:47:15,110
And at midnight the ogress
came once more

244
00:47:15,520 --> 00:47:18,353
Hobble, cackle, gobble

245
00:47:18,600 --> 00:47:22,878
''Who is awake in my temple?''

246
00:47:24,480 --> 00:47:26,072
Father's home

247
00:47:29,920 --> 00:47:32,480
Give mother the fish

248
00:47:39,280 --> 00:47:40,474
Put it down

249
00:47:49,720 --> 00:47:52,553
Come here, l have lots to tell you

250
00:48:13,920 --> 00:48:16,195
No matter what people say...

251
00:48:17,760 --> 00:48:20,035
...landlord Ray is a good man

252
00:48:26,520 --> 00:48:29,478
My three months' wages

253
00:48:29,680 --> 00:48:33,958
First l will say evening prayers,
then l have much to tell you

254
00:48:49,600 --> 00:48:55,470
Today l met a rich farmer.
l don't know him...

255
00:48:56,160 --> 00:49:02,474
...but he greeted me
and said my father knew him

256
00:49:03,920 --> 00:49:09,870
He said my father officiated
as a priest in his household

257
00:49:10,240 --> 00:49:15,030
Now he wants me to perform
the same duties

258
00:49:15,840 --> 00:49:20,072
They're having a religious
ceremony next month

259
00:49:20,280 --> 00:49:22,430
He wants me to baptise them

260
00:49:25,480 --> 00:49:27,596
-They are rich
-Have you agreed?

261
00:49:29,520 --> 00:49:34,036
lf l agree straight away,
they'll think we are starving

262
00:49:34,240 --> 00:49:36,629
Accept at once

263
00:49:36,840 --> 00:49:42,278
The trouble is that some people
will criticize if they know

264
00:49:42,520 --> 00:49:43,475
Who will know?

265
00:49:44,520 --> 00:49:47,956
You might talk; you know
what women are like

266
00:49:48,840 --> 00:49:51,912
l have better things to do
with my time

267
00:49:52,920 --> 00:49:56,959
Don't be upset. The client
won't run away

268
00:49:57,760 --> 00:50:02,038
l mustn't seem over-eager; he can
wait until after the festival

269
00:50:02,520 --> 00:50:05,273
We'll manage on my wages until then

270
00:50:05,480 --> 00:50:09,314
The children need new clothes
and Auntie needs a shawl

271
00:50:09,840 --> 00:50:11,671
We owe Mrs Mukherji five rupees

272
00:50:11,880 --> 00:50:15,998
We'll have to pay all that
out of the wages

273
00:50:18,160 --> 00:50:19,673
And the repairs?

274
00:50:19,880 --> 00:50:23,111
We have survived the monsoon

275
00:50:23,320 --> 00:50:27,108
The repairs must wait,
but l'll get estimates

276
00:50:27,320 --> 00:50:30,278
Something must be done to the kitchen

277
00:50:30,520 --> 00:50:37,119
Don't worry. Kitchen, walls, roof,
everything will be done

278
00:50:42,920 --> 00:50:45,115
How many days to the festival?

279
00:50:47,520 --> 00:50:48,475
Twenty-one

280
00:51:05,520 --> 00:51:08,034
Did you take Tunu's beads?

281
00:51:11,680 --> 00:51:14,513
-Do you know who did?
-No. Go to sleep

282
00:51:16,760 --> 00:51:19,957
l have another idea for a play

283
00:51:20,160 --> 00:51:24,950
l might be able to write it in a week

284
00:51:37,240 --> 00:51:42,473
You once lived in Benares;
did you have friends there?

285
00:51:42,680 --> 00:51:45,877
l had a few

286
00:51:47,160 --> 00:51:50,197
lsn't there a place by the river...

287
00:51:50,400 --> 00:51:53,710
...where men recite from
the scriptures?

288
00:51:54,680 --> 00:51:58,355
lt's called Dasasvamedh Ghat

289
00:51:58,920 --> 00:52:00,956
Let's go to Benares.

290
00:52:02,560 --> 00:52:05,028
Don't the orators earn lots of money?

291
00:52:05,240 --> 00:52:09,279
We can't go. How can we?

292
00:52:10,240 --> 00:52:15,951
This is my ancestral home;
how can l leave it?

293
00:52:16,680 --> 00:52:20,275
Why not? You were away
eight years before

294
00:52:20,480 --> 00:52:23,472
You left me at my father's
and never wrote

295
00:52:23,680 --> 00:52:27,958
Then l did not know how sweet you are

296
00:52:28,160 --> 00:52:29,718
Save your compliments

297
00:52:30,760 --> 00:52:32,751
This is my home, too

298
00:52:36,320 --> 00:52:40,279
But look at it: it's like
living in the forest

299
00:52:41,760 --> 00:52:45,469
At night the jackals prowl around

300
00:52:47,000 --> 00:52:51,039
There are no neighbours
l can talk to

301
00:52:52,160 --> 00:52:57,712
You are not always here
and sometimes l'm so depressed

302
00:53:00,240 --> 00:53:02,470
You won't understand these things

303
00:53:03,680 --> 00:53:08,879
You live in your work. Sometimes
you're paid, sometimes not

304
00:53:12,320 --> 00:53:17,269
l had dreams, too, of all the things
l would do

305
00:53:21,880 --> 00:53:25,714
Those who came before are gone

306
00:53:25,920 --> 00:53:29,469
I am left behind,
a penniless beggar

307
00:53:30,080 --> 00:53:35,473
Day draws to its close,
night's mantle descends

308
00:53:35,680 --> 00:53:41,198
Row me across to the other side

309
00:54:27,000 --> 00:54:31,118
Hurry with the twigs, this wood
is too damp to light

310
00:54:48,520 --> 00:54:53,469
A new shawl, Auntie? How nice

311
00:55:20,480 --> 00:55:23,040
What a lovely shawl, Auntie

312
00:55:23,520 --> 00:55:29,470
Raju gave it to me, to keep me
warm in the evenings

313
00:55:39,080 --> 00:55:42,516
We're having a picnic;
please cook something

314
00:55:59,320 --> 00:56:02,471
Why is it never her turn
to go and fetch things?

315
00:56:52,160 --> 00:56:54,037
What's the matter?

316
00:57:01,160 --> 00:57:02,275
What's that shawl?

317
00:57:04,760 --> 00:57:08,833
lt's a present from Raju

318
00:57:09,320 --> 00:57:11,470
A present, was it?

319
00:57:14,160 --> 00:57:15,115
You didn't ask?

320
00:57:15,680 --> 00:57:16,749
Why should l?

321
00:57:18,480 --> 00:57:22,951
l just remarked that the evenings
were chilly, so he said...

322
00:57:23,160 --> 00:57:25,310
Would he feed you, too?

323
00:57:25,840 --> 00:57:30,470
Don't be angry. l did ask Hori
for a shawl

324
00:57:31,760 --> 00:57:35,878
And as he couldn't give it to you
at once, you went begging

325
00:57:36,520 --> 00:57:38,636
You should be ashamed

326
00:57:38,840 --> 00:57:40,831
Can't an old woman have whims?

327
00:57:41,760 --> 00:57:43,239
Whims?

328
00:57:43,440 --> 00:57:48,116
Don't you realize that the children
often go hungry?

329
00:57:48,320 --> 00:57:53,474
Are you going to dress and feed them?

330
00:57:54,280 --> 00:57:59,115
lf you're staying here, stop begging;
otherwise, go away

331
00:58:00,520 --> 00:58:04,593
l can always find
somewhere else to go

332
00:58:05,760 --> 00:58:08,479
Fine! Take yourself off

333
00:58:43,520 --> 00:58:47,479
You'd better go; you can't
stay here any longer

334
00:58:53,520 --> 00:58:58,196
lt's lovely; your husband
will enjoy your cooking

335
00:59:02,520 --> 00:59:05,557
-When is the wedding?
-l've forgotten

336
00:59:05,760 --> 00:59:07,478
l know when

337
00:59:08,920 --> 00:59:12,469
lt's in two months, isn't it?

338
00:59:14,320 --> 00:59:17,630
-What does it feel like?
-Much the same

339
00:59:17,840 --> 00:59:20,638
-Tell me
-You'll find out

340
00:59:20,840 --> 00:59:25,277
lt won't happen to me,
l just know it won't

341
00:59:25,680 --> 00:59:31,277
Your mother is arranging a match,
just wait and see

342
00:59:51,520 --> 00:59:56,116
Raju, are you at home?

343
00:59:56,480 --> 00:59:59,870
-Who is it?
-Your old auntie

344
01:00:02,320 --> 01:00:07,269
l wonder whether you can take me in,
just for a few days?

345
01:00:09,240 --> 01:00:11,470
Only a few days

346
01:00:11,680 --> 01:00:16,470
l get no peace at the other place,
nothing but nagging

347
01:00:18,240 --> 01:00:19,468
Come in

348
01:00:20,760 --> 01:00:24,469
Tell your mother that Auntie
has come to stay

349
01:00:24,680 --> 01:00:27,797
Bring her a chair and a bowl of water

350
01:00:28,000 --> 01:00:33,870
l've nowhere to go now l'm old,
so l thought of you

351
01:01:38,000 --> 01:01:43,233
Beware, King! lf you utter
those words again...

352
01:01:43,440 --> 01:01:46,034
...l shall cut out your tongue...

353
01:01:46,280 --> 01:01:50,239
...and throw it to the jackals
and the dogs!

354
01:01:50,440 --> 01:01:54,399
And l shall destroy you,
for the good of the world!

355
01:01:54,600 --> 01:01:59,913
Father, do not do it, l beseech you!

356
01:04:35,200 --> 01:04:38,556
Durga, go and find the calf

357
01:04:38,760 --> 01:04:41,718
Please tie this on for me

358
01:04:44,240 --> 01:04:47,357
Apu, let's look for Auntie

359
01:04:47,680 --> 01:04:50,956
l want you to find the calf first

360
01:04:51,360 --> 01:04:53,157
What's that?

361
01:04:55,760 --> 01:04:57,990
Who gave you the silver paper?

362
01:05:43,200 --> 01:05:48,320
-He's been at my toy-box
-You're too old for a toy-box now

363
01:05:49,200 --> 01:05:51,156
He took my silver paper

364
01:05:51,360 --> 01:05:53,794
Go and find the calf

365
01:05:59,120 --> 01:06:00,030
Stupid!

366
01:06:00,560 --> 01:06:02,915
Dressing up as a prince

367
01:07:21,560 --> 01:07:25,348
Anyone at home?

368
01:07:25,560 --> 01:07:27,516
Why have you come back?

369
01:07:29,800 --> 01:07:32,519
l'm not feeling very well

370
01:07:32,720 --> 01:07:37,510
l'd like to spend my last days
in the old home

371
01:07:37,720 --> 01:07:43,352
What's the old home to you?
The best thing you can do is leave

372
01:07:44,200 --> 01:07:46,350
Just a minute

373
01:08:11,120 --> 01:08:13,076
What are you waiting for?

374
01:08:13,960 --> 01:08:17,919
Let me rest here awhile

375
01:08:42,240 --> 01:08:46,153
Sister-in-law,
have you gone to sleep?

376
01:08:47,800 --> 01:08:50,598
Will you give me some water?

377
01:08:50,800 --> 01:08:53,758
Your bowl is there; help yourself

378
01:13:21,920 --> 01:13:22,875
Sit down

379
01:13:27,320 --> 01:13:28,070
Eat it

380
01:13:33,920 --> 01:13:35,353
Where are we?

381
01:13:36,880 --> 01:13:38,233
What are those?

382
01:17:42,400 --> 01:17:46,518
Those who came before are gone

383
01:17:46,760 --> 01:17:51,117
I am left behind
Row me across to the other side

384
01:17:51,320 --> 01:17:56,713
Day draws to its close,
night's mantle descends

385
01:18:44,800 --> 01:18:46,438
Will you be away for long?

386
01:18:46,640 --> 01:18:50,997
About a week. l'll call at
Bistupar on the way back

387
01:18:51,200 --> 01:18:57,116
lt's a good market town;
something may turn up there

388
01:19:51,360 --> 01:19:53,635
Look, there's father

389
01:19:56,880 --> 01:19:58,711
Ask him for some money

390
01:20:38,560 --> 01:20:43,270
Put the cat down and go and buy
some molasses

391
01:20:45,520 --> 01:20:51,311
Apu wants rice pudding; he's been
asking for it for days

392
01:20:59,520 --> 01:21:02,080
A letter!

393
01:21:07,760 --> 01:21:09,512
Give it to me

394
01:21:25,280 --> 01:21:27,794
I arrived here yesterday

395
01:21:28,000 --> 01:21:31,151
The rich farmer has lost two sons...

396
01:21:31,360 --> 01:21:35,069
...so a ceremony
is out of the question now

397
01:21:35,280 --> 01:21:38,556
ut don't worry

398
01:21:38,760 --> 01:21:44,710
I'll try to earn money for the
repairs and then l'll return home

399
01:21:44,920 --> 01:21:47,992
Do not worry

400
01:21:52,440 --> 01:21:57,639
Whatever God wills is for the best
Give my love to Durga and Apu

401
01:21:57,920 --> 01:22:00,878
Charity, lady

402
01:22:12,360 --> 01:22:15,079
Alms, good mother

403
01:22:26,760 --> 01:22:30,070
Bless you. One day you will be
goddess of wealth

404
01:28:27,120 --> 01:28:29,236
Why didn't you tell me?

405
01:28:30,920 --> 01:28:35,072
You can't go on like this;
why didn't you tell me?

406
01:28:35,280 --> 01:28:38,636
After all, we're not strangers

407
01:28:39,840 --> 01:28:45,710
Every day l hope there will be
some news

408
01:28:48,120 --> 01:28:50,395
lt never comes

409
01:28:50,760 --> 01:28:55,072
Five months now without news,
without letters

410
01:28:56,120 --> 01:29:00,398
Let Durga come with me; l'll give her
something to tide you over

411
01:29:04,360 --> 01:29:08,239
-Don't be silly
-l can't take it

412
01:29:12,680 --> 01:29:15,148
l feel so ashamed

413
01:29:37,600 --> 01:29:40,398
A letter!

414
01:30:00,360 --> 01:30:04,876
No doubt you are worried because
I have not written for months

415
01:30:05,120 --> 01:30:09,875
Anyway, l have good news:
I have been able to earn money

416
01:30:10,120 --> 01:30:13,476
I shall be returning home soon

417
01:30:13,680 --> 01:30:17,559
Whatever God wills is for the best

418
01:33:02,840 --> 01:33:06,719
Holy Pond, Flower Garland,
who prays here at noon?

419
01:33:08,360 --> 01:33:12,035
l, fortunate sister of my brothers

420
01:33:36,600 --> 01:33:41,116
Mother Goddess, counsel me,
l know not how to pray

421
01:33:46,080 --> 01:33:50,073
May l live in happiness
with my husband

422
01:33:50,280 --> 01:33:54,637
Mother Goddess, grant me this boon

423
01:36:26,400 --> 01:36:30,029
Rain, rain, go away...

424
01:37:35,960 --> 01:37:37,916
Any news of Hori?

425
01:37:38,280 --> 01:37:41,477
He says he will be back this month

426
01:37:42,280 --> 01:37:44,191
Why is he away so long?

427
01:37:47,760 --> 01:37:50,797
Have you any sago?
l can let you have some

428
01:37:51,120 --> 01:37:54,749
lf the fever continues to increase,
apply cold compresses

429
01:37:57,040 --> 01:38:03,070
No cause for alarm; just see that
she doesn't get another chill

430
01:38:13,200 --> 01:38:17,079
We'll go and see the train
when l'm better, shall we?

431
01:38:18,120 --> 01:38:22,033
We'll have a good look next time

432
01:43:28,720 --> 01:43:31,109
Durga is worse; can you come?

433
01:43:34,760 --> 01:43:38,799
Sweep the yard. l'm going
to look at Durga

434
01:44:20,960 --> 01:44:25,238
Fetch my husband; say l asked him
to come

435
01:44:27,920 --> 01:44:32,072
-ls Durga asleep?
-Yes. Run along, dear

436
01:47:36,520 --> 01:47:40,399
Mother sends these vegetables.
l'll put them here

437
01:48:28,120 --> 01:48:32,238
lt would fall while l was away.
Couldn't it have waited?

438
01:50:01,400 --> 01:50:03,072
How are you?

439
01:50:11,920 --> 01:50:15,117
Are the children out?

440
01:50:35,280 --> 01:50:40,559
Where are you going now?
l've brought some presents

441
01:50:41,600 --> 01:50:44,239
l'd have come earlier, if l could

442
01:50:44,680 --> 01:50:49,231
My luck turned at Ranaghat,
at long last

443
01:50:49,680 --> 01:50:54,800
See what l bought in the market there
a pastry-board and rolling pin

444
01:50:58,280 --> 01:51:03,115
A picture of Goddess Lakshmi,
which you asked me to get

445
01:51:04,440 --> 01:51:06,954
A new sari for Durga

446
01:52:48,080 --> 01:52:51,038
After this last year l have
no affection for the old home

447
01:52:54,680 --> 01:52:58,958
l don't know
what we would have done...

448
01:52:59,600 --> 01:53:05,038
...if you and your husband
hadn't helped us

449
01:53:05,600 --> 01:53:11,470
lf we had done more,
perhaps you would have stayed

450
01:53:11,760 --> 01:53:15,548
lt's not your fault,
it's just our bad luck

451
01:53:15,760 --> 01:53:19,389
Other people live here quite happily

452
01:53:19,840 --> 01:53:24,231
l hope you'll settle down
in the new place

453
01:53:33,200 --> 01:53:38,035
These fell in the storm; l thought
you'd like them for the journey

454
01:53:38,280 --> 01:53:39,713
How kind

455
01:53:39,920 --> 01:53:45,711
lt's only a few mangoes. l've done
nothing for you in the past

456
01:53:46,800 --> 01:53:48,677
You're really going tomorrow?

457
01:53:49,280 --> 01:53:53,432
Yes. Perhaps we should have
told you before

458
01:53:53,640 --> 01:53:58,839
Never mind. l think that
leaving here is a good idea

459
01:54:00,280 --> 01:54:06,719
Everyone should make a move
once in a while

460
01:54:08,280 --> 01:54:13,195
Staying in one place makes you mean;
it's done that to me

461
01:54:16,280 --> 01:54:21,593
l'd like to go away, too;
l'll see what my husband says

462
01:54:33,920 --> 01:54:38,038
Don't put yourself out on my account

463
01:54:50,080 --> 01:54:54,870
l've been confined to bed
for over a month...

464
01:54:55,920 --> 01:54:59,549
...so l couldn't come to see you

465
01:54:59,920 --> 01:55:05,631
l'm told you're moving to Benares;
is that so?

466
01:55:05,840 --> 01:55:09,879
Yes, we're leaving at dawn tomorrow

467
01:55:10,520 --> 01:55:14,035
You're going tomorrow?

468
01:55:18,760 --> 01:55:23,390
Think for a moment, is this
a wise decision?

469
01:55:24,280 --> 01:55:29,229
You are Rajkestra's son,
Tarkalankar's grandson

470
01:55:29,840 --> 01:55:33,037
Your family has lived here
for generations

471
01:55:33,280 --> 01:55:39,435
We village elders still exist.
You could have asked our advice

472
01:55:39,640 --> 01:55:42,234
Would that have helped?

473
01:55:42,440 --> 01:55:47,036
Look at the house; l haven't
the means to repair it

474
01:55:47,280 --> 01:55:51,239
Perhaps l should have asked
for your help...

475
01:55:51,440 --> 01:55:54,796
...but how long could that last?

476
01:55:55,000 --> 01:56:00,393
l have been saddled with debts
for fifteen years

477
01:56:00,840 --> 01:56:07,029
My hopes of clearing them by selling
some furniture came to nothing

478
01:56:08,440 --> 01:56:13,195
l wanted to be a writer; now my
manuscripts are worm eaten

479
01:56:13,440 --> 01:56:16,398
l hoped to educate my boy,
but it was not to be

480
01:56:16,600 --> 01:56:20,229
And the girl... she is at rest

481
01:56:22,280 --> 01:56:26,751
Sometimes it is necessary
to leave the ancestral home

482
01:56:26,960 --> 01:56:29,679
ln town l may earn a little...

483
01:56:29,880 --> 01:56:33,236
...reciting from the scriptures
