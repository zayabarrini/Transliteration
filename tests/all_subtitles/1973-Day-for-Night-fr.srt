1
00:00:27,903 --> 00:00:29,655
DAY FOR NIGHT

2
00:00:29,780 --> 00:00:32,741
Silence, please, and
watch the notes carefully.

3
00:00:39,456 --> 00:00:42,793
Slowly. Nice and relaxed.

4
00:00:46,046 --> 00:00:49,216
The beginning again.

5
00:00:49,341 --> 00:00:53,095
All together, give
me a nice dean attack.

6
00:00:56,557 --> 00:00:59,601
Here’s where you can speed up a bit.

7
00:01:04,022 --> 00:01:07,943
Keep the legato going. No breaks.

8
00:01:10,570 --> 00:01:12,489
That’s it.

9
00:01:35,012 --> 00:01:38,348
Accent that last
chord, but then hold it.

10
00:01:40,684 --> 00:01:43,103
Take it from 13.

11
00:01:44,938 --> 00:01:49,067
Don’t get sentimental.
Just play the notes.

12
00:02:00,037 --> 00:02:03,040
DEDICATED TO LILLIAN AND DOROTHY GISH

13
00:03:08,980 --> 00:03:09,648
Cut!

14
00:03:11,566 --> 00:03:15,362
Everyone over here, please!

15
00:03:16,530 --> 00:03:18,865
We’re gonna do it once more.

16
00:03:22,035 --> 00:03:24,996
What happened coming out of the Metro?

17
00:03:25,122 --> 00:03:26,748
It was better last time.

18
00:03:26,873 --> 00:03:30,001
And the bus was two seconds late.

19
00:03:30,127 --> 00:03:32,879
The background action

20
00:03:33,046 --> 00:03:35,382
by the beauty parlor was late too.

21
00:03:35,549 --> 00:03:39,136
A lady was supposed to
come out. I never saw her.

22
00:03:39,261 --> 00:03:42,264
The bicyclist never came by either.

23
00:03:42,389 --> 00:03:44,599
So let’s do it again.

24
00:03:45,058 --> 00:03:48,311
The beginning was especially off,

25
00:03:48,437 --> 00:03:50,188
around the Metro.

26
00:03:50,564 --> 00:03:54,901
Everyone came out together,
then suddenly everyone was gone.

27
00:03:55,026 --> 00:03:58,405
Feet and frames, start and
finish, then circle this.

28
00:03:59,698 --> 00:04:01,908
- And who’s this for?
- You.

29
00:04:02,075 --> 00:04:03,869
You mean I keep it?

30
00:04:03,994 --> 00:04:07,038
- Kill that light!
- Yes, sir.

31
00:04:07,164 --> 00:04:09,124
Ladies and gentlemen,

32
00:04:09,249 --> 00:04:11,960
here we are at the
Victorine Studios in Nice,

33
00:04:12,085 --> 00:04:14,921
where we’ll be watching the
first day of filming on...

34
00:04:15,088 --> 00:04:16,923
Meet Pamela.

35
00:04:17,048 --> 00:04:20,594
Unfortunately you won’t
actually be meeting Pamela,

36
00:04:20,760 --> 00:04:24,598
because the young actress
playing Pamela, Julie Baker,

37
00:04:24,765 --> 00:04:27,851
is still in Hollywood,
but she’s due soon.

38
00:04:27,976 --> 00:04:31,062
Put all the other stars are here,

39
00:04:31,188 --> 00:04:33,982
and I hope to interview them shortly.

40
00:04:34,107 --> 00:04:37,611
I’ll have a swollen cheek for
three weeks, but no big deal.

41
00:04:38,195 --> 00:04:40,614
This is our male lead.

42
00:04:40,739 --> 00:04:43,074
I’ll leave you two.
- But Mr. Bertrand!

43
00:04:43,325 --> 00:04:46,036
You’re the producer. Come talk to us.

44
00:04:46,161 --> 00:04:48,497
No, a producer should stay out of sight.

45
00:04:48,622 --> 00:04:50,040
It’s the story

46
00:04:50,165 --> 00:04:52,918
of a man in his ’50s whose son brings

47
00:04:53,043 --> 00:04:56,838
his young English bride
home to meet his parents.

48
00:04:57,172 --> 00:05:00,884
It’s the story of a young man
who marries an English girl.

49
00:05:01,009 --> 00:05:03,762
Three months later, he
introduces her to his parents

50
00:05:03,887 --> 00:05:05,597
at their seaside villa.

51
00:05:05,722 --> 00:05:07,724
My character falls in love

52
00:05:07,849 --> 00:05:10,685
with his daughter-in-law,
and she with him.

53
00:05:10,810 --> 00:05:13,188
She falls in love
with her father-in-law.

54
00:05:13,313 --> 00:05:17,442
It shows this adulterous
couple running off together.

55
00:05:17,567 --> 00:05:19,152
Then what happens?

56
00:05:19,277 --> 00:05:21,446
The film is played as a tragedy,

57
00:05:21,571 --> 00:05:23,949
and each character meets
with his inevitable destiny.

58
00:05:24,074 --> 00:05:27,035
And now please excuse
me. I’m needed on the set.

59
00:05:27,160 --> 00:05:28,995
Pamela 1, take 4!

60
00:05:29,162 --> 00:05:31,831
Put some life into it!

61
00:05:33,875 --> 00:05:35,627
The bus!

62
00:05:38,797 --> 00:05:41,508
News vendor, more energetic!

63
00:05:49,724 --> 00:05:51,726
Lady with the dog, faster!

64
00:05:51,851 --> 00:05:54,688
More activity around the Metro!

65
00:05:54,855 --> 00:05:56,982
Now the white car!

66
00:05:58,525 --> 00:06:00,902
Alphonse, get ready.

67
00:06:01,027 --> 00:06:03,405
Come Lip out of the Metro.\

68
00:06:07,242 --> 00:06:08,952
Faster.

69
00:06:10,370 --> 00:06:13,164
More activity on the cafe terrace.

70
00:06:15,333 --> 00:06:17,877
Lady with the dog, keep going.

71
00:06:20,130 --> 00:06:21,881
Red car.

72
00:06:22,215 --> 00:06:24,342
Faster, red car.

73
00:06:24,676 --> 00:06:26,761
Red car, drive off.

74
00:06:26,887 --> 00:06:28,847
Get ready, Walter.

75
00:06:28,972 --> 00:06:31,224
Camera, move in on Alexandre.

76
00:06:31,600 --> 00:06:33,476
Closer.

77
00:06:36,521 --> 00:06:39,274
Cut! Let’s do it again.

78
00:06:39,399 --> 00:06:40,150
Roll camera!

79
00:06:45,363 --> 00:06:46,031
Cut!

80
00:06:46,907 --> 00:06:50,035
- That last one was good.
- But let’s redo it.

81
00:06:50,160 --> 00:06:54,372
Starting places again, everyone!

82
00:06:58,335 --> 00:06:59,920
And go!

83
00:07:31,451 --> 00:07:33,119
In Nice. Hold on, please.

84
00:07:33,286 --> 00:07:35,622
I have a tub. I wanted a shower.

85
00:07:35,789 --> 00:07:37,874
Could I change rooms?

86
00:07:38,041 --> 00:07:41,920
- I have a shower. I prefer a tub.
- Then we can trade.

87
00:07:42,045 --> 00:07:44,756
Shall we go up together? Great!

88
00:07:45,006 --> 00:07:48,635
Is your room quiet?
- Yes, I can’t stand noise.

89
00:07:48,760 --> 00:07:52,430
Mine too, so it’s a good trade.

90
00:07:56,768 --> 00:07:59,229
Can you give him these
pictures of Julie?

91
00:07:59,688 --> 00:08:01,439
All right, Joelle.

92
00:08:04,484 --> 00:08:07,445
Joelle said to give you
these pictures of Julie.

93
00:08:07,570 --> 00:08:09,364
Thanks, Odile.

94
00:08:09,489 --> 00:08:12,367
Walter, the pictures of Julie.

95
00:08:12,492 --> 00:08:16,454
Ah, I’ve seen her before!
That movie with the car chase.

96
00:08:17,205 --> 00:08:19,332
Didn’t she crack up once?

97
00:08:19,499 --> 00:08:22,752
She had a nervous breakdown,
but that was a year ago.

98
00:08:22,877 --> 00:08:25,422
I heard she didn’t even finish the film.

99
00:08:25,547 --> 00:08:28,133
True, but then she married her doctor,

100
00:08:28,258 --> 00:08:30,844
so I think she’s
probably doing fine now.

101
00:08:30,969 --> 00:08:34,055
- Bertrand’s not worried?
- I don’t think so.

102
00:08:34,180 --> 00:08:36,474
She’s lovely. This is a good likeness.

103
00:08:36,599 --> 00:08:39,686
- Any of her in the short wig?
- Here’s one.

104
00:08:39,853 --> 00:08:42,689
It’s a bit dark.
- We can lighten it.

105
00:08:42,856 --> 00:08:45,650
Because she’ll be wearing a wig.

106
00:08:45,775 --> 00:08:47,736
She has lovely eyes.

107
00:08:47,861 --> 00:08:50,238
Yes, light green eyes.

108
00:08:50,864 --> 00:08:53,074
Looks so much like her mother.!

109
00:08:53,199 --> 00:08:56,661
Her face has a pretty
shape. She’s lovely.

110
00:08:56,786 --> 00:08:59,831
This one’s good too. She looks sad...

111
00:08:59,956 --> 00:09:01,207
but sexy too.

112
00:09:01,332 --> 00:09:03,918
I’d like to show you the -

113
00:09:04,043 --> 00:09:06,379
Fine, Bernard. Let’s have a look.

114
00:09:06,546 --> 00:09:09,049
The trick candle for the costume party.

115
00:09:09,215 --> 00:09:12,010
You just plug it in. Could you light it?

116
00:09:12,177 --> 00:09:15,597
The actress has to it keep
it turned toward her face,

117
00:09:15,722 --> 00:09:19,392
so the light seems to
come from the candle.

118
00:09:19,517 --> 00:09:23,229
She mustn’t turn the
light toward the camera,

119
00:09:23,396 --> 00:09:25,899
or it’ll give away the trick.

120
00:09:26,024 --> 00:09:28,526
- Very good.
- All right?

121
00:09:28,651 --> 00:09:30,278
Okay, I’m sold.

122
00:09:31,321 --> 00:09:35,992
And the wire goes...?
- Up her sleeve and then down.

123
00:09:36,159 --> 00:09:38,119
Look at this vase.

124
00:09:38,286 --> 00:09:40,830
This hotel vase isn’t bad.

125
00:09:40,955 --> 00:09:42,957
I’d like to see it

126
00:09:43,124 --> 00:09:45,710
in Severine’s dining room in the film.

127
00:09:45,835 --> 00:09:49,088
- It’s all cracked.
- Take it. Not a word to anyone.

128
00:09:54,803 --> 00:09:57,096
Hi, Liliane. Hi, Alphonse.

129
00:09:57,263 --> 00:09:59,098
For you.

130
00:09:59,307 --> 00:10:01,100
Thanks for the internship.

131
00:10:01,267 --> 00:10:04,437
It’s nothing. Think you’ll
enjoy being a script girl?

132
00:10:04,604 --> 00:10:07,649
It’s hard to say after just one day.

133
00:10:07,816 --> 00:10:12,070
- It’s a great job. You’ll see.
- I’ll let you know in two months.

134
00:10:12,195 --> 00:10:14,155
Okay. So long, kids.1

135
00:10:14,906 --> 00:10:17,075
Hey, you didn’t tell me

136
00:10:17,200 --> 00:10:18,952
he was stone deaf.

137
00:10:19,118 --> 00:10:22,831
“Stone deaf”! His ear got a
little messed up in the artillery.

138
00:10:22,956 --> 00:10:24,999
- Really?
- Listen...

139
00:10:25,124 --> 00:10:26,793
do something for me.

140
00:10:26,960 --> 00:10:29,712
Walk ahead of me so
I can watch your ass.

141
00:10:29,838 --> 00:10:31,631
Like this?

142
00:10:31,840 --> 00:10:33,716
That’s great.

143
00:10:53,570 --> 00:10:55,655
- I saw that.
- Saw what?

144
00:10:55,780 --> 00:10:58,199
You’ve got your eye on the maid.

145
00:10:58,408 --> 00:10:59,826
Bastard.

146
00:10:59,951 --> 00:11:03,246
Just your type. A
bouncy little duckling.

147
00:11:03,371 --> 00:11:05,665
Don’t tell me you’re jealous.

148
00:11:05,832 --> 00:11:09,335
Not at all. Jealousy is dumb.

149
00:11:09,460 --> 00:11:13,506
Unless you’re ready to go
all the way and commit murder.

150
00:11:13,673 --> 00:11:16,050
You’re the jealous type.
- Me?

151
00:11:16,176 --> 00:11:19,095
It’s obvious. Your
eyebrows almost touch.

152
00:11:19,512 --> 00:11:21,222
They do?

153
00:11:21,681 --> 00:11:23,683
No, they don’t.

154
00:11:23,933 --> 00:11:27,353
These beds look so sad.
Shall we put them together?

155
00:11:27,478 --> 00:11:28,855
Yes, let’s.

156
00:11:29,022 --> 00:11:31,149
But we have to move the table.

157
00:11:31,608 --> 00:11:34,819
You could have asked for a double bed.

158
00:11:34,944 --> 00:11:39,616
That meant asking Lajoie,
the production manager.

159
00:11:41,784 --> 00:11:43,536
It’s heavy.

160
00:11:44,746 --> 00:11:46,414
Careful.

161
00:11:49,792 --> 00:11:51,544
Now the other one.

162
00:11:57,175 --> 00:12:00,053
This is tougher than moving an audience.

163
00:12:01,387 --> 00:12:03,264
What shall we do tonight?

164
00:12:03,389 --> 00:12:06,726
Pierrot, the set
photographer, gave me a list

165
00:12:07,018 --> 00:12:10,188
of great little
restaurants up in the hills.

166
00:12:10,355 --> 00:12:12,857
Great little restaurants?

167
00:12:13,399 --> 00:12:15,568
We have to go eat, don’t we?

168
00:12:15,944 --> 00:12:17,737
You gotta be kidding.

169
00:12:17,904 --> 00:12:20,823
We’re in a city with 37 movie theaters.

170
00:12:20,990 --> 00:12:23,326
We check the paper, pick a movie,

171
00:12:23,493 --> 00:12:26,955
go to the theater,
find out when it starts,

172
00:12:27,163 --> 00:12:31,125
and if there’s time, we
grab a quick sandwich.

173
00:12:33,836 --> 00:12:37,757
So your photographer can take his list

174
00:12:37,966 --> 00:12:40,426
of quaint little bistros

175
00:12:40,593 --> 00:12:42,303
and shove it.

176
00:12:42,470 --> 00:12:44,055
You’re impossible.

177
00:12:44,597 --> 00:12:46,391
You kill me.

178
00:12:46,516 --> 00:12:50,019
I’m not going to a movie
tonight, and I’m not eating here.

179
00:12:50,186 --> 00:12:51,729
You decide.

180
00:12:51,896 --> 00:12:54,607
Okay. We’ll do whatever you want.

181
00:12:55,149 --> 00:12:56,776
On one condition.

182
00:12:56,943 --> 00:12:58,528
Which is?

183
00:13:12,083 --> 00:13:14,043
That you marry me.

184
00:13:20,299 --> 00:13:24,095
Odile, try this on so
you can be in the scene.

185
00:13:25,722 --> 00:13:27,849
Hold that. Not bad, huh?

186
00:13:27,974 --> 00:13:29,976
Nice. Let’s see the apron.

187
00:13:30,560 --> 00:13:33,438
- Sold?
- Yeah, I’ll buy it.

188
00:13:34,022 --> 00:13:37,817
Shooting a film is like crossing
the Wild West by stagecoach.

189
00:13:37,942 --> 00:13:40,153
You set out hoping for a nice trip,

190
00:13:40,278 --> 00:13:43,323
but soon you wonder if you’ll
ever reach your destination.

191
00:13:43,489 --> 00:13:45,366
Sorry to bother you, sir.

192
00:13:45,533 --> 00:13:48,995
I’m Lajoie, the new production manager.
- Ah, of course!

193
00:13:49,120 --> 00:13:51,748
Regarding the car for Pamela’s accident,

194
00:13:51,873 --> 00:13:54,250
you have your choice of these two.

195
00:13:54,375 --> 00:13:56,002
These two?

196
00:13:57,045 --> 00:14:00,089
The white one would work.
Could we paint it blue?

197
00:14:00,631 --> 00:14:02,842
For 2,000 francs.

198
00:14:03,009 --> 00:14:06,471
Just to paint it blue?
We’ll use it as it is.

199
00:14:06,596 --> 00:14:09,015
But it is awfully white.

200
00:14:09,557 --> 00:14:11,642
What about that blue one?

201
00:14:11,851 --> 00:14:15,521
That belongs to your assistant
director, Jean-Francois.

202
00:14:15,688 --> 00:14:17,732
He might not mind.

203
00:14:17,857 --> 00:14:20,443
- I’ll ask him.
- Yes, do that.

204
00:14:20,651 --> 00:14:22,653
What is a director?

205
00:14:22,779 --> 00:14:26,574
Someone who’s asked endless
questions about everything.

206
00:14:27,909 --> 00:14:30,495
Sometimes he has
answers, but not always.

207
00:14:30,620 --> 00:14:34,248
- Did this square work out?
- Very well.

208
00:14:34,373 --> 00:14:36,584
And we had great weather too.

209
00:14:36,709 --> 00:14:39,670
- Can I show you the bungalow?
- Sure, let’s go.

210
00:14:39,796 --> 00:14:43,383
No, it’s not built
yet. Just the sketches.

211
00:14:43,716 --> 00:14:46,219
It will be completely furnished:

212
00:14:46,385 --> 00:14:49,639
bed, night tables, chairs -

213
00:14:49,764 --> 00:14:53,142
Hold on. The camera
will never go inside.

214
00:14:53,267 --> 00:14:56,229
We’ll shoot through
the window from outside,

215
00:14:56,396 --> 00:15:00,817
so all we’ll see is the bed.
- Okay.

216
00:15:03,403 --> 00:15:05,571
Ah, Ferrand.

217
00:15:06,114 --> 00:15:08,699
Sorry to bother you with this,

218
00:15:08,825 --> 00:15:12,078
but the Americans insist
on the original plan

219
00:15:12,245 --> 00:15:15,081
to shoot the film in seven weeks.

220
00:15:15,248 --> 00:15:19,377
Think you can do it?
- It won’t be easy.

221
00:15:19,585 --> 00:15:23,089
A few extra days for pickup
shots with a skeleton crew

222
00:15:23,214 --> 00:15:25,550
won’t be the end of the world,

223
00:15:25,675 --> 00:15:29,262
but the actors must be
finished by October 31.

224
00:15:29,387 --> 00:15:33,141
I’ll have another look at the
schedule with Jean-Francois.

225
00:15:34,433 --> 00:15:38,104
Seven weeks, five days per week
- 35 days.

226
00:15:38,229 --> 00:15:40,857
I’ll never shoot this film in 35 days!

227
00:15:41,107 --> 00:15:43,276
Could you look at this?

228
00:15:43,442 --> 00:15:45,486
It’s Severine’s wig.

229
00:15:45,695 --> 00:15:48,948
Is it a bit too light?

230
00:15:49,115 --> 00:15:52,785
Too light? Listen, I really don’t know.

231
00:15:52,952 --> 00:15:55,746
Tell Joelle to see Walter about it.

232
00:15:55,872 --> 00:15:58,583
He’s the cameraman. They’ll work it out.

233
00:15:59,208 --> 00:16:02,170
The prop guy wants
to show you something.

234
00:16:02,295 --> 00:16:04,130
Bernard!
- Coming.

235
00:16:06,632 --> 00:16:10,094
Which of these do you
like for the final scene?

236
00:16:12,013 --> 00:16:14,557
Alphonse has small hands.

237
00:16:14,765 --> 00:16:18,477
But we won’t take the smallest.
The next largest. This one.

238
00:16:19,937 --> 00:16:23,065
Pamela crew, report
to the screening room.

239
00:16:24,192 --> 00:16:25,735
Here they are.

240
00:16:27,195 --> 00:16:30,907
Rank and file all
present and accounted for?

241
00:16:31,032 --> 00:16:33,659
You’d be lost without the rank and file.

242
00:16:34,160 --> 00:16:36,162
Yann, what are we seeing?

243
00:16:36,287 --> 00:16:38,831
Severine and Alphonse.
“I’ll kill them both.”

244
00:16:38,956 --> 00:16:42,126
- And the scene in the square?
- It didn’t come in.

245
00:16:42,251 --> 00:16:46,088
That’s strange. We never
got the scene in the square.

246
00:16:46,214 --> 00:16:49,300
Lajoie, call and ask the lab in Paris.

247
00:16:49,425 --> 00:16:50,509
It’s Sequence 1.

248
00:16:50,635 --> 00:16:53,763
We’ll go ahead. Who’s missing? Severine?

249
00:16:53,888 --> 00:16:57,058
She never comes to rushes.
- I see. Roll it!

250
00:17:00,519 --> 00:17:03,981
- Alexandre’s not here.
- He’s at the airport, as usual.

251
00:17:04,148 --> 00:17:08,152
- Why’s he always there?
- He must be expecting someone.

252
00:17:08,277 --> 00:17:10,363
I suspect trouble in his private life.

253
00:17:14,242 --> 00:17:17,703
Mother, I have to talk to you.

254
00:17:17,870 --> 00:17:19,664
About them. Do you mind?

255
00:17:19,872 --> 00:17:21,749
- Yes.
- But I have to.

256
00:17:22,041 --> 00:17:25,086
I know where they are. In Paris.

257
00:17:25,545 --> 00:17:27,713
They’re not even hiding.

258
00:17:29,048 --> 00:17:31,300
Why torment yourself, son?

259
00:17:31,884 --> 00:17:35,554
Be like me. Put them
out of your thoughts.

260
00:17:35,763 --> 00:17:38,349
I can think of nothing else.

261
00:17:38,474 --> 00:17:41,727
Shall we go away, you and I? Faraway?

262
00:17:42,311 --> 00:17:44,730
We can do whatever you like.

263
00:17:49,986 --> 00:17:53,114
I’ve made up my mind.
I’m going to Paris...

264
00:17:53,281 --> 00:17:54,949
to kill them both.

265
00:17:55,491 --> 00:17:58,035
Scene 1, take 4.

266
00:17:58,244 --> 00:18:01,831
Mother, I have to talk to you.

267
00:18:01,956 --> 00:18:04,125
About them. Do you mind?

268
00:18:05,167 --> 00:18:07,753
- Yes.
- But I have to.

269
00:18:08,587 --> 00:18:10,756
I know where they are.

270
00:18:10,923 --> 00:18:13,467
They’re in Paris.

271
00:18:14,093 --> 00:18:17,596
They’re not even hiding.
- That line’s better in take 3.

272
00:18:17,722 --> 00:18:20,433
Why torture yourself, son?

273
00:18:20,558 --> 00:18:24,645
Be like me. Put them
out of your thoughts.

274
00:18:24,770 --> 00:18:27,732
I can think of nothing else.
I refuse to just accept it.

275
00:18:29,608 --> 00:18:33,362
Shall we go away, you and I? Faraway?

276
00:18:33,863 --> 00:18:36,657
We can do whatever you like.

277
00:18:39,118 --> 00:18:42,788
I’ve made up my mind.
I’m going to Paris...

278
00:18:43,122 --> 00:18:45,916
to kill them both.

279
00:18:49,295 --> 00:18:51,297
We have a big problem.

280
00:18:51,464 --> 00:18:53,466
A power failure at the lab

281
00:18:53,632 --> 00:18:56,093
ruined the crowd scene
with all the extras.

282
00:18:56,218 --> 00:18:58,471
The whole thing has to be reshot.

283
00:18:58,638 --> 00:19:01,265
When can you do it?
- The day after tomorrow.

284
00:19:01,390 --> 00:19:05,061
No, not before Monday. We
have to round up 150 extras.

285
00:19:05,186 --> 00:19:08,481
- Will the insurance cover it?
- I hope so!

286
00:19:08,647 --> 00:19:12,651
You know, real estate is where
the money is today, not movies.

287
00:19:12,818 --> 00:19:15,655
I only stay in it because I love it.

288
00:19:21,160 --> 00:19:24,997
If we have to reshoot the
scene, we’ll reshoot the scene.

289
00:19:27,583 --> 00:19:29,710
Alexandre, how are you?

290
00:19:29,835 --> 00:19:32,838
- Nice. Is that for me?
- No.

291
00:19:33,214 --> 00:19:35,883
Lajoie, our production manager.

292
00:19:36,217 --> 00:19:39,095
What’s that?
- For Madame Severine.

293
00:19:39,220 --> 00:19:43,099
In newspaper? Looks like
crap. Go wrap it properly.

294
00:19:44,141 --> 00:19:45,851
Tell me...

295
00:19:46,852 --> 00:19:49,397
does Severine know I’m
playing her husband?

296
00:19:49,522 --> 00:19:52,149
Of course. She was delighted.

297
00:19:53,359 --> 00:19:56,195
- Glad to hear it.
- Go say hello.

298
00:19:56,320 --> 00:19:58,823
I’d love to. Where’s her dressing room?

299
00:20:05,621 --> 00:20:08,290
Come in.

300
00:20:18,759 --> 00:20:21,220
I’m so happy to see you!

301
00:20:21,345 --> 00:20:23,180
Divinamente bella!

302
00:20:23,305 --> 00:20:25,558
What about you, you old dog!

303
00:20:25,683 --> 00:20:28,227
How do you stay so young?

304
00:20:31,105 --> 00:20:34,525
I’m so happy to be working with you.
- Same here.

305
00:20:35,067 --> 00:20:37,903
Remember when we first met in Hollywood?

306
00:20:38,070 --> 00:20:40,322
Shut up!

307
00:20:40,614 --> 00:20:43,576
No dates, no numbers,

308
00:20:43,701 --> 00:20:46,370
or I’ll tell everyone
you had a facelift.

309
00:20:46,495 --> 00:20:49,373
Not yet, but soon.

310
00:20:49,498 --> 00:20:51,250
You know what?

311
00:20:51,375 --> 00:20:52,918
Just for you...

312
00:20:53,043 --> 00:20:55,379
I could take up cooking again.

313
00:20:55,504 --> 00:20:58,924
Remember how you loved
my risotto alia milanese?

314
00:20:59,091 --> 00:21:01,886
- Well, not anymore.
- What?

315
00:21:02,011 --> 00:21:04,096
Just kidding!

316
00:21:04,263 --> 00:21:06,765
I’ll eat your risotto anytime.

317
00:21:06,891 --> 00:21:10,227
- Are we working together today?
- No, you and Alphonse are.

318
00:21:10,352 --> 00:21:13,147
I’m going to the
airport. See you tomorrow.

319
00:21:15,566 --> 00:21:18,360
That man is adorable!

320
00:21:21,530 --> 00:21:24,784
I worked with him – mamma mia! -

321
00:21:24,950 --> 00:21:27,244
20 years ago in Hollywood.

322
00:21:27,536 --> 00:21:30,122
We were there at the same time.

323
00:21:30,456 --> 00:21:33,667
He was a real ladies’ man.
- Really?

324
00:21:34,710 --> 00:21:36,670
In Hollywood they called him...

325
00:21:38,839 --> 00:21:41,008
I loved him myself.
- Is he married?

326
00:21:41,300 --> 00:21:43,344
I don’t know about now.

327
00:21:43,469 --> 00:21:47,014
He was married and divorced twice.

328
00:21:47,181 --> 00:21:49,099
Maybe he’s living with someone.

329
00:21:49,225 --> 00:21:52,186
No one knows these days.
He’s very secretive.

330
00:21:52,311 --> 00:21:55,940
He has a mustache in the movie.
I like him better that way.

331
00:21:56,065 --> 00:21:59,652
Mustache or not, he’s
still playing lovers,

332
00:21:59,818 --> 00:22:01,862
and look at me!

333
00:22:01,987 --> 00:22:04,990
I’m typecast now as
the neglected wife -

334
00:22:05,115 --> 00:22:08,285
a desperate, tragic pain in the ass!

335
00:22:08,410 --> 00:22:10,621
- You’re beautiful.
- I look awful!

336
00:22:10,996 --> 00:22:13,916
Help me rehearse today’s scene.

337
00:22:14,083 --> 00:22:16,544
I can’t remember a line.

338
00:22:17,920 --> 00:22:21,549
I don’t know why, but lately...

339
00:22:21,715 --> 00:22:24,593
my memory has gone to hell.

340
00:22:29,223 --> 00:22:33,352
Monsieur Walter to set 7, please.

341
00:22:36,272 --> 00:22:38,524
Terrific dressing room.

342
00:22:38,649 --> 00:22:42,653
Nice and spacious. All that’s
missing are the flowers.

343
00:22:42,778 --> 00:22:44,697
They’ve been ordered.

344
00:22:44,822 --> 00:22:47,867
You know, I admire Julie
Baker as much as you do.

345
00:22:47,992 --> 00:22:49,994
You wanted her. We got her.

346
00:22:50,119 --> 00:22:52,663
But if she walks out, we’re up a creek.

347
00:22:52,788 --> 00:22:54,498
What do you mean?

348
00:22:54,623 --> 00:22:58,544
After her medical exam, the
insurance doctor refused to okay her.

349
00:22:58,669 --> 00:23:00,921
Said she’s still too nervous

350
00:23:01,046 --> 00:23:03,674
and that we should wait a month.

351
00:23:03,799 --> 00:23:05,968
What did the Americans say?

352
00:23:06,093 --> 00:23:09,555
Thankfully, they’re more
flexible than the French.

353
00:23:09,722 --> 00:23:12,099
They’re willing to risk it.

354
00:23:12,224 --> 00:23:15,394
But if she cracks up, no
one will take the blame,

355
00:23:15,519 --> 00:23:17,521
and we’ll all be screwed!

356
00:23:17,646 --> 00:23:21,066
Well, if we didn’t trust
our luck now and then...

357
00:23:21,191 --> 00:23:24,111
- You’re right.
- ...we’d be in some other line of work.

358
00:23:24,236 --> 00:23:26,238
Still, it’s a gamble.

359
00:23:26,405 --> 00:23:28,574
Did you discuss the
rushes with Severine?

360
00:23:28,741 --> 00:23:30,409
I went to say hello.

361
00:23:30,576 --> 00:23:33,579
You know she and Alexandre
had an affair once?

362
00:23:33,746 --> 00:23:36,498
- Yes, I heard.
- Very stormy.

363
00:23:36,624 --> 00:23:38,626
Really set tongues wagging.

364
00:23:38,751 --> 00:23:41,003
And it ended disastrously.

365
00:23:41,128 --> 00:23:45,674
No producer could get them to
work together for four years.

366
00:23:45,925 --> 00:23:47,801
They hated each other.

367
00:23:47,968 --> 00:23:50,929
But time heals all wounds.

368
00:23:51,180 --> 00:23:54,683
- Hello, Alphonse.
- Got a minute?

369
00:23:54,808 --> 00:23:57,686
Don’t forget about my check.
- I think of nothing but.

370
00:23:57,811 --> 00:23:59,438
Me too.

371
00:23:59,605 --> 00:24:01,607
This’ll only take a minute.

372
00:24:01,899 --> 00:24:05,027
Great dressing room!
Much nicer than mine.

373
00:24:05,152 --> 00:24:06,654
It’s Julie’s.

374
00:24:06,820 --> 00:24:08,989
You know Liliane and
I are getting married?

375
00:24:09,156 --> 00:24:11,158
Wonderful! Glad to hear it.

376
00:24:11,283 --> 00:24:14,453
Here in Nice, before we finish shooting.

377
00:24:14,620 --> 00:24:18,248
I was wondering: Would
you mind being my best man?

378
00:24:18,415 --> 00:24:21,460
Not at all. I’d be delighted.

379
00:24:21,627 --> 00:24:24,004
You think this looks all right?

380
00:24:24,171 --> 00:24:26,757
It’s not bad.
- Nice blue.

381
00:24:29,760 --> 00:24:33,639
Buddy, hit the fireplace
with a senior spot.

382
00:24:34,682 --> 00:24:36,684
Open it up a bit.

383
00:24:36,809 --> 00:24:38,602
That’s good. Hold it.

384
00:24:38,727 --> 00:24:42,648
And use a bam door on the
fire, or we won’t see it.

385
00:24:45,651 --> 00:24:48,987
I can’t take my eyes off the fire.

386
00:24:50,781 --> 00:24:54,576
People used to watch a
fire like they watch TV now.

387
00:24:54,702 --> 00:24:56,120
I think we’ve always needed

388
00:24:56,245 --> 00:24:59,164
to watch flickering images
after the evening meal.

389
00:24:59,289 --> 00:25:00,708
I never thought of that.

390
00:25:00,916 --> 00:25:03,836
Liliane, Alphonse told me the news.

391
00:25:03,961 --> 00:25:07,214
I’m very happy for you. Congratulations.

392
00:25:07,381 --> 00:25:09,216
Congratulations?

393
00:25:10,801 --> 00:25:15,139
- Gilbert, light up the central.
- Put out the fire.

394
00:25:15,264 --> 00:25:17,307
It’s smoking up the set.

395
00:25:22,604 --> 00:25:25,816
I’d like to introduce two German girls.

396
00:25:25,941 --> 00:25:28,485
They’re sisters: Greta and Diana.

397
00:25:28,736 --> 00:25:30,863
She was in a big German political film.

398
00:25:30,988 --> 00:25:32,364
You make political films?

399
00:25:33,032 --> 00:25:36,535
She made an erotic film.
Why don’t you make one?

400
00:25:36,827 --> 00:25:38,328
I have an interesting script

401
00:25:38,454 --> 00:25:40,330
about pollution.

402
00:25:40,497 --> 00:25:43,083
Excuse me, sir. We have a problem.

403
00:25:43,250 --> 00:25:45,544
- What problem?
- I’m just rescuing you.

404
00:25:45,669 --> 00:25:49,381
Ferrand, this is Mr. Giacometti.

405
00:25:49,548 --> 00:25:53,051
Got a minute?
- This is a tricky shot. Afterwards.

406
00:25:53,635 --> 00:25:57,097
Who’s that guy?
- The cop who okayed us to shoot

407
00:25:57,222 --> 00:26:00,601
in the streets. So Bertrand
invited him to watch us work.

408
00:26:01,185 --> 00:26:03,979
Do I watch him when he works?

409
00:26:04,146 --> 00:26:06,607
When he questions people?

410
00:26:07,858 --> 00:26:10,402
Severine, we’re ready.

411
00:26:18,076 --> 00:26:19,620
You start here.

412
00:26:19,912 --> 00:26:23,081
Quiet. A full rehearsal.

413
00:26:23,248 --> 00:26:26,919
Quiet, everyone. And go, Severine.

414
00:26:27,711 --> 00:26:30,297
I really don’t
understand you, Alexandre.

415
00:26:30,589 --> 00:26:32,549
You’ve been acting -

416
00:26:32,674 --> 00:26:34,426
“Peculiar.”

417
00:26:34,551 --> 00:26:38,097
That’s okay. From the top, right away.

418
00:26:41,433 --> 00:26:43,894
I really don’t
understand you, Alexandre.

419
00:26:44,019 --> 00:26:46,605
You’ve been acting peculiar lately.

420
00:26:46,772 --> 00:26:49,149
Walking out during dinner last night

421
00:26:49,358 --> 00:26:51,360
was very rude to Julie -

422
00:26:51,485 --> 00:26:53,612
Shit! I said “Julie”
instead of “Pamela.”

423
00:26:53,779 --> 00:26:54,905
Don’t worry.

424
00:26:55,030 --> 00:26:56,865
That’s no good.

425
00:26:57,032 --> 00:27:00,244
- It’s okay. From the top.
- I have an idea.

426
00:27:00,494 --> 00:27:04,623
Why don’t I use numbers,
the way I do with Federico?

427
00:27:04,957 --> 00:27:08,794
Instead of “I really don’t
understand you, Alexandre...”

428
00:27:08,961 --> 00:27:12,631
I say, “22, 83, 16, 72...

429
00:27:12,756 --> 00:27:16,009
5, 3, 18, 9, 14, 7, 9...

430
00:27:16,677 --> 00:27:21,265
17, 10, 10, 4, 18, 69!” How’s that?

431
00:27:21,390 --> 00:27:24,768
Impossible, Severine.
It’s very nice, but -

432
00:27:24,893 --> 00:27:27,563
Here in France, we
have to say the lines.

433
00:27:27,688 --> 00:27:29,898
We’re recording direct sound.

434
00:27:30,065 --> 00:27:32,484
You have to say the real lines.

435
00:27:32,651 --> 00:27:36,280
You always give me my
lines at the last minute.

436
00:27:36,405 --> 00:27:38,949
Then we’ll use cue cards.

437
00:27:39,074 --> 00:27:41,660
Joelle, come here, darling.

438
00:27:41,827 --> 00:27:44,162
It’s all your fault, Ferrand.

439
00:27:44,496 --> 00:27:47,916
“I really don’t
understand you, Alexandre.

440
00:27:48,041 --> 00:27:50,335
You’ve been acting peculiar lately.”

441
00:27:51,128 --> 00:27:54,381
- Cut lots. We 7/ need them.
- Who askedyou?

442
00:27:54,840 --> 00:27:57,092
How’s this?

443
00:27:57,217 --> 00:27:59,678
A bit more this way.

444
00:27:59,803 --> 00:28:02,055
The last one’s over behind the column.

445
00:28:02,514 --> 00:28:05,517
- Starting position, Severine.
- Wait. Sound’s reloading.

446
00:28:05,642 --> 00:28:07,519
No, sound’s ready.

447
00:28:07,644 --> 00:28:09,521
Hurry up, Bernard.

448
00:28:16,028 --> 00:28:17,654
Go ahead, Severine.

449
00:28:17,779 --> 00:28:20,198
I really don’t
understand you, Alexandre.

450
00:28:20,782 --> 00:28:25,329
You’ve been acting peculiar lately.

451
00:28:26,288 --> 00:28:29,249
Walking out during dinner last night

452
00:28:29,374 --> 00:28:32,669
was rude to... Pamela.

453
00:28:33,337 --> 00:28:35,964
She is Alphonse’s wife, after all.

454
00:28:36,548 --> 00:28:39,384
You seem to hate her,

455
00:28:39,551 --> 00:28:42,512
to purposely avoid speaking to her.

456
00:28:43,513 --> 00:28:46,475
What do you want? You
can see we’re talking.

457
00:28:46,600 --> 00:28:48,143
Go away.

458
00:28:49,895 --> 00:28:52,189
And I won’t put up with it.

459
00:28:54,983 --> 00:28:56,485
Cut!

460
00:28:58,070 --> 00:29:00,822
I did it! That was good, right?

461
00:29:00,948 --> 00:29:02,699
Very nice...

462
00:29:02,824 --> 00:29:06,787
but that’s not the right
door. -1 thought it was.

463
00:29:06,912 --> 00:29:10,040
That’s the closet. This is the door.

464
00:29:10,207 --> 00:29:12,167
Let’s do it again.

465
00:29:12,292 --> 00:29:14,836
From the top again.

466
00:29:15,003 --> 00:29:18,757
- I thought it was the same door.
- No problem. Ready.

467
00:29:18,924 --> 00:29:21,718
They do look alike.

468
00:29:25,263 --> 00:29:26,431
Roll camera!

469
00:29:29,768 --> 00:29:32,813
I really don’t
understand you, Alexandre.

470
00:29:34,147 --> 00:29:36,858
You’ve been acting peculiar lately.

471
00:29:37,067 --> 00:29:41,446
Walking out during dinner last
night was very rude to Pamela.

472
00:29:41,738 --> 00:29:44,741
She is Alphonse’s wife, after all.

473
00:29:45,242 --> 00:29:47,160
You seem to hate her,

474
00:29:47,285 --> 00:29:49,329
to purposely avoid speaking to her.

475
00:29:51,164 --> 00:29:54,418
What do you want? You
can see we’re talking.

476
00:29:54,543 --> 00:29:56,003
Go away.

477
00:29:57,337 --> 00:29:59,923
And I won’t put up with it.

478
00:30:03,969 --> 00:30:06,305
Darling, look.

479
00:30:06,930 --> 00:30:09,016
I know the doors look alike.

480
00:30:10,600 --> 00:30:12,811
Not that one. This one.

481
00:30:18,734 --> 00:30:20,527
Bernard...

482
00:30:22,362 --> 00:30:25,115
you’re the only one who understands.

483
00:30:25,240 --> 00:30:27,409
Will you come to my dressing room?

484
00:30:30,495 --> 00:30:33,165
Come to my dressing room.
- Of course.

485
00:30:35,542 --> 00:30:37,127
It’s not this one...

486
00:30:44,968 --> 00:30:47,596
I really don’t
understand you, Alexandre.

487
00:30:47,846 --> 00:30:51,433
You’ve been acting peculiar lately.

488
00:30:51,850 --> 00:30:56,146
Walking out during dinner last
night was very rude to Pamela.

489
00:30:56,355 --> 00:30:58,523
She is Alphonse’s wife, after all.

490
00:30:58,690 --> 00:31:00,734
You seem to hate her,

491
00:31:00,859 --> 00:31:04,029
to purposely avoid speaking to her.

492
00:31:05,072 --> 00:31:07,949
What do you want? You
can see we’re talking.

493
00:31:08,075 --> 00:31:09,868
Go away.

494
00:31:10,368 --> 00:31:12,621
And I won’t put up with it.

495
00:31:14,748 --> 00:31:15,832
She’ll never get it.

496
00:31:15,957 --> 00:31:17,501
It’s not my fault!

497
00:31:17,626 --> 00:31:19,961
Cut. Let’s do it again.

498
00:31:20,629 --> 00:31:24,049
It’s not my fault. I’m so confused.

499
00:31:24,216 --> 00:31:28,720
I don’t know if she’s Odile the
actress or Odile the makeup girl.

500
00:31:28,887 --> 00:31:32,307
In my day, acting was acting,

501
00:31:32,682 --> 00:31:34,559
and makeup was makeup.

502
00:31:34,726 --> 00:31:37,312
It’s not my fault.

503
00:31:42,943 --> 00:31:46,029
Everyone not needed on the set,

504
00:31:46,196 --> 00:31:48,907
please leave now. Thanks.

505
00:32:04,923 --> 00:32:06,883
Alphonse, come back.

506
00:32:07,008 --> 00:32:09,594
That doesn’t mean you. Stay if you like.

507
00:32:09,803 --> 00:32:12,305
I wanted to go to the movies anyway.

508
00:32:12,764 --> 00:32:15,892
Give me my mirror.

509
00:32:16,435 --> 00:32:20,063
It’s her fault, hitting
the bottle like that.

510
00:32:20,188 --> 00:32:22,691
Her son’s dying of leukemia.

511
00:32:22,816 --> 00:32:25,527
She knows a phone call
could come any minute.

512
00:32:25,652 --> 00:32:27,737
She almost turned down the film.

513
00:32:29,739 --> 00:32:32,033
I really don’t
understand you, Alexandre.

514
00:32:32,284 --> 00:32:35,704
You’ve been acting peculiar lately.

515
00:32:36,246 --> 00:32:38,415
Walking out...

516
00:32:38,540 --> 00:32:40,584
during dinner last night...

517
00:32:41,126 --> 00:32:44,004
was very rude to Pamela.

518
00:32:44,129 --> 00:32:46,715
She is Alphonse’s wife, after all.

519
00:32:46,965 --> 00:32:49,468
You seem to hate her...

520
00:32:57,976 --> 00:33:00,896
It’ll be all right, Severine.

521
00:33:01,021 --> 00:33:03,231
We’ll take a little break.

522
00:33:03,356 --> 00:33:05,066
don’t know what it is.

523
00:33:05,192 --> 00:33:08,278
Maybe the wig’s giving me a headache.

524
00:33:08,403 --> 00:33:11,323
This has never happened before.

525
00:33:11,907 --> 00:33:13,658
It’s the first time.

526
00:33:13,867 --> 00:33:15,869
It’s all right.

527
00:33:15,994 --> 00:33:19,164
We’ll continue the scene
tomorrow. Get some rest.

528
00:33:19,539 --> 00:33:22,083
Where’s Odile? No, not Odile.

529
00:33:22,292 --> 00:33:24,836
Where’s the makeup
girl? I’d like my scarf.

530
00:33:33,637 --> 00:33:37,140
Mr. Ferrand, why don’t
you make political films?

531
00:33:38,975 --> 00:33:41,478
Why don’t you make erotic films?

532
00:33:42,103 --> 00:33:46,024
The Americans insist you
finish shooting in seven weeks.

533
00:34:04,209 --> 00:34:07,837
Madame Severine needs Odile in makup.

534
00:34:09,881 --> 00:34:12,342
Who’s that woman I keep seeing?

535
00:34:12,592 --> 00:34:15,637
Lajoie’s wife. She
follows him everywhere.

536
00:34:15,762 --> 00:34:18,431
Want me to get rid of her?

537
00:34:18,557 --> 00:34:20,976
No, I’m getting used to her.

538
00:34:22,310 --> 00:34:25,146
I don’t know why Ferrand cast me.

539
00:34:25,272 --> 00:34:28,525
He can’t stand me.
- Where’d you get that idea?

540
00:34:28,650 --> 00:34:31,611
And I know he thinks
I’m a lousy actress.

541
00:34:31,736 --> 00:34:35,115
Just between us, he may be right.

542
00:34:35,407 --> 00:34:39,411
No, he didn’t cast me.
Was it the producer?

543
00:34:40,245 --> 00:34:42,831
There’s something
strange about this film.

544
00:34:42,956 --> 00:34:45,333
He never considered anyone else.

545
00:34:45,542 --> 00:34:48,878
- Really?
- I’m positive. Come on.

546
00:34:50,547 --> 00:34:53,258
You never understand anything anyway.

547
00:34:53,466 --> 00:34:57,304
I certainly don’t understand
this! It’s destroying me!

548
00:34:57,470 --> 00:35:00,807
I’m sorry, but I was
hired to play a secretary.

549
00:35:01,016 --> 00:35:03,893
No one ever mentioned a bathing suit.

550
00:35:04,019 --> 00:35:07,772
If they had, I’d have brought my own.

551
00:35:07,939 --> 00:35:11,609
It may not be in the script,
but the scene works better.

552
00:35:11,818 --> 00:35:15,739
Alexandre has brought his secretary
along as a guest on vacation.

553
00:35:15,864 --> 00:35:20,076
You’re swimming, and he
calls you to dictate a letter.

554
00:35:20,201 --> 00:35:24,581
Sorry. I just can’t. I’m
not just being difficult.

555
00:35:24,706 --> 00:35:27,125
I even took typing lessons.

556
00:35:27,292 --> 00:35:29,502
I wasn’t told I’d be swimming.

557
00:35:29,627 --> 00:35:31,755
I won’t go near the water.

558
00:35:32,130 --> 00:35:33,632
Joelle...

559
00:35:34,507 --> 00:35:37,302
what can we shoot until
that idiot calms down?

560
00:35:37,427 --> 00:35:41,389
The pool scene’s all we have
until Julie Baker gets here.

561
00:35:41,514 --> 00:35:44,142
Then go talk to her.
Try to convince her.

562
00:35:44,309 --> 00:35:48,480
An actress who won’t appear in a
bathing suit in 1972 is ludicrous.

563
00:35:52,776 --> 00:35:55,028
Action! Messenger!

564
00:35:56,613 --> 00:35:59,032
Darling, a telegram!

565
00:35:59,199 --> 00:36:00,825
The kids are coming.

566
00:36:00,992 --> 00:36:04,996
You see, sir, we’ve
never met our son’s wife.

567
00:36:05,163 --> 00:36:08,583
No, wait. This is for you.

568
00:36:08,708 --> 00:36:10,960
- So they’re coming?
- Day after tomorrow.

569
00:36:11,086 --> 00:36:14,172
They finally decided? I’m very happy.

570
00:36:14,381 --> 00:36:17,509
I’ll write and tell Stanley
to arrange everything.

571
00:36:17,634 --> 00:36:21,179
Stacey, would you mind taking a letter?

572
00:36:21,346 --> 00:36:24,432
It must go out today.
- Coming, sir.

573
00:36:24,557 --> 00:36:27,435
Don’t worry, Stanley
will work things out.

574
00:36:27,602 --> 00:36:31,439
Renting the house across
the way would be ideal.

575
00:36:31,564 --> 00:36:34,818
That would be marvelous,
having them so close!

576
00:36:34,943 --> 00:36:38,863
Stacey, sorry to bother you with
this. It’s a letter to Stanley.

577
00:36:39,030 --> 00:36:40,865
“Dear Stanley...

578
00:36:41,032 --> 00:36:44,828
I’m pleased to announce that
my son Alphonse is arriving

579
00:36:44,953 --> 00:36:47,414
with his young bride...”

580
00:36:47,539 --> 00:36:51,376
Now I see why she wouldn’t
wear a bathing suit. Look.

581
00:36:51,543 --> 00:36:53,044
She looks lovely.

582
00:36:53,169 --> 00:36:55,505
You don’t get it. Look closer.

583
00:36:55,630 --> 00:36:56,756
Good God!

584
00:36:58,299 --> 00:37:02,220
Stacey pulled a fast one.
She’s three months’ pregnant.

585
00:37:02,345 --> 00:37:05,265
I say we fire her and
get another actress.

586
00:37:05,390 --> 00:37:09,686
I don’t agree. Frankly,
I don’t think it shows.

587
00:37:09,853 --> 00:37:11,813
Come here a minute.

588
00:37:13,481 --> 00:37:15,775
Look at our schedule.

589
00:37:16,109 --> 00:37:18,236
She shoots one more day,

590
00:37:18,403 --> 00:37:21,030
and then she comes back in six weeks.

591
00:37:21,197 --> 00:37:23,658
By then it will be obvious.

592
00:37:23,867 --> 00:37:25,952
No, we have to replace her.

593
00:37:26,411 --> 00:37:29,622
It’s not that hard.
We’ll pick someone now

594
00:37:29,789 --> 00:37:31,541
and call their agent.

595
00:37:31,666 --> 00:37:34,002
There are all kinds of girls.

596
00:37:34,753 --> 00:37:38,381
Stacey has an iron-clad
contract. I can call her agent,

597
00:37:38,631 --> 00:37:40,884
but he has us over a barrel.

598
00:37:41,134 --> 00:37:42,594
You know why?

599
00:37:42,761 --> 00:37:45,972
Because in this world, the
stronger hand always wins.

600
00:37:47,265 --> 00:37:49,601
Package for you, sir.

601
00:37:49,768 --> 00:37:52,020
Ah, the books I ordered.

602
00:37:56,232 --> 00:37:59,903
- The composer calling from Paris.
- It’s Georges.

603
00:38:00,737 --> 00:38:04,532
Ferrand, here’s the playback
for the costume party scene.

604
00:38:29,974 --> 00:38:32,602
It’s beautiful. I’m very pleased.

605
00:38:32,727 --> 00:38:35,355
Thanks so much. Talk to you later.

606
00:38:36,397 --> 00:38:39,859
The airport, Julie’s
plane, press conference.

607
00:38:40,026 --> 00:38:41,819
I can’t be late.

608
00:38:42,070 --> 00:38:45,198
Listen, you’re so fond of improvising.

609
00:38:45,657 --> 00:38:49,452
Why can’t the secretary
be pregnant in the film?

610
00:38:49,994 --> 00:38:51,829
Ah, maybe that could -

611
00:38:51,996 --> 00:38:54,999
No, it will look like
Alexandre’s the father.

612
00:38:55,166 --> 00:38:58,628
It’ll confuse the story
line. No, it won’t work.

613
00:39:00,713 --> 00:39:02,841
Come to think of it...

614
00:39:03,007 --> 00:39:05,260
Stacey isn’t married.

615
00:39:05,635 --> 00:39:08,346
I wonder who the father is.

616
00:39:51,681 --> 00:39:54,100
Your questions, gentlemen.

617
00:39:54,976 --> 00:39:57,812
Can you tell us about your new film?

618
00:39:57,937 --> 00:40:00,523
Meet Pamela is the
story of an English girl

619
00:40:00,648 --> 00:40:03,234
who falls in love with
her husband’s father

620
00:40:03,359 --> 00:40:05,111
and runs off with him.

621
00:40:05,236 --> 00:40:08,698
I believe it’s based
on a real-life incident.

622
00:40:08,823 --> 00:40:10,533
How does it end?

623
00:40:10,992 --> 00:40:14,579
Since it’s a tragedy,

624
00:40:15,246 --> 00:40:16,956
it ends unhappily,

625
00:40:17,081 --> 00:40:20,835
but I’d rather not
reveal all the details.

626
00:40:20,960 --> 00:40:25,590
Do you think that people these
days are interested in a girl

627
00:40:25,757 --> 00:40:28,134
who sleeps with the
son and then the father?

628
00:40:33,765 --> 00:40:38,686
When I like a script enough to do it,

629
00:40:38,853 --> 00:40:41,522
I trust that audiences will like it too.

630
00:40:41,648 --> 00:40:44,567
- You really feel that?
- Yes, and I hope I’m right.

631
00:40:44,692 --> 00:40:49,155
Forgive me for intruding
into your private life,

632
00:40:49,322 --> 00:40:52,450
but American papers reported

633
00:40:52,575 --> 00:40:55,995
that you were in fragile health
and you married your doctor.

634
00:40:56,287 --> 00:40:58,498
No, I didn’t marry my doctor.

635
00:40:58,623 --> 00:41:00,750
I married a man who is a doctor.

636
00:41:00,875 --> 00:41:03,836
Why isn’t the lucky man among us?

637
00:41:03,962 --> 00:41:08,091
My husband came with
me and is in fact here

638
00:41:08,299 --> 00:41:09,926
in this very room.

639
00:41:10,051 --> 00:41:11,552
Where is he?

640
00:41:11,678 --> 00:41:14,305
I can’t tell you. He hates publicity.

641
00:41:14,430 --> 00:41:16,974
On that little note of mystery,

642
00:41:17,141 --> 00:41:20,436
we'll let Miss Baker i get to her hotel.

643
00:41:30,488 --> 00:41:33,700
We’ll let the reporters leave first.

644
00:41:36,661 --> 00:41:39,580
Meet my husband, Dr. Nelson.

645
00:41:46,421 --> 00:41:48,506
Could you move back, please?!

646
00:41:48,756 --> 00:41:50,883
You’re in the shot there.

647
00:41:51,718 --> 00:41:53,386
Thank you very much.

648
00:41:54,220 --> 00:41:56,347
She’s always around!

649
00:41:56,472 --> 00:41:58,015
That’s Lajoie’s wife.

650
00:41:58,141 --> 00:42:00,351
Is she learning his job or what?

651
00:42:00,518 --> 00:42:03,521
No, she thinks all the
women are after him.

652
00:42:03,688 --> 00:42:07,608
She makes his life hell, and
he’s too weak to dump her.

653
00:42:07,734 --> 00:42:10,403
We all call them “The
Sorrow and the Pity.”

654
00:42:11,904 --> 00:42:14,115
Lajoie, we’re ready to shoot.

655
00:42:15,366 --> 00:42:16,826
What’s going on there?

656
00:42:18,077 --> 00:42:19,746
That looks like bad news.

657
00:42:20,079 --> 00:42:22,039
You have le trac?

658
00:42:22,331 --> 00:42:24,125
What’s that mean?

659
00:42:27,211 --> 00:42:30,214
Liliane, slate this one, please.

660
00:42:30,381 --> 00:42:32,383
Our photographer keeps busy!

661
00:42:33,926 --> 00:42:34,927
Roll camera!

662
00:42:41,309 --> 00:42:43,061
The car!

663
00:43:01,746 --> 00:43:03,956
Hello, my darlings!

664
00:43:04,290 --> 00:43:05,917
My parents.

665
00:43:06,793 --> 00:43:08,878
Here she is. Meet Pamela.

666
00:43:09,003 --> 00:43:11,547
Walter, get to the stairs.

667
00:43:11,672 --> 00:43:14,342
I know you’ll be happy here.

668
00:43:14,467 --> 00:43:17,095
It’s a shame our house is so small.

669
00:43:17,261 --> 00:43:21,516
Come out on the balcony.
You can see the ocean.

670
00:43:21,849 --> 00:43:23,309
She’s charming.

671
00:43:23,434 --> 00:43:25,228
Do you like it?

672
00:43:27,939 --> 00:43:30,316
My son never tells me anything.

673
00:43:30,483 --> 00:43:32,902
He’s never even told me how you met

674
00:43:33,027 --> 00:43:34,195
Really?

675
00:43:34,320 --> 00:43:37,448
I was on vacation in Yorkshire
with two of my cousins,

676
00:43:37,615 --> 00:43:39,450
Dorothy and Elizabeth.

677
00:43:39,617 --> 00:43:41,577
He had a date with Dorothy,

678
00:43:41,786 --> 00:43:45,164
but she got chicken pox,
and I took her place.

679
00:43:46,124 --> 00:43:48,459
I don’t know Dorothy,

680
00:43:48,626 --> 00:43:51,420
but I’m glad you didn’t get chicken pox.

681
00:43:51,629 --> 00:43:53,130
Who got chicken pox?

682
00:43:53,339 --> 00:43:54,340
Guess.

683
00:43:54,924 --> 00:43:56,134
Cut!

684
00:43:56,592 --> 00:43:57,969
Was that okay?

685
00:43:58,094 --> 00:44:00,930
Not bad, but let’s try something else.

686
00:44:01,806 --> 00:44:03,724
We’re doing it again?

687
00:44:03,850 --> 00:44:05,268
Was I late?

688
00:44:05,434 --> 00:44:08,437
Walter, let’s try a different angle.

689
00:44:08,896 --> 00:44:11,607
You can take a break, Severine.

690
00:44:16,279 --> 00:44:20,324
I wanted you here with me,
so I got you the internship.

691
00:44:20,575 --> 00:44:23,035
I wanted us to be together.

692
00:44:23,286 --> 00:44:26,747
I don’t want to be a script
girl. I’m not learning a thing.

693
00:44:26,873 --> 00:44:28,875
I want to learn film editing.

694
00:44:29,041 --> 00:44:30,251
Film editing?

695
00:44:30,418 --> 00:44:34,171
You just had to say so.
I’d have arranged it.

696
00:44:35,882 --> 00:44:39,635
Say, Pierre... you’re
here to take stills, right?

697
00:44:41,053 --> 00:44:43,514
Watch out for the camera, idiot!

698
00:44:45,683 --> 00:44:48,477
Odile, get this bottle out of my sight.

699
00:44:50,438 --> 00:44:52,148
How’s your mother?

700
00:44:52,356 --> 00:44:55,109
Fine. I told her we’d
be working together.

701
00:44:55,276 --> 00:44:57,153
She sends her love.

702
00:44:57,278 --> 00:45:00,531
Marvelous woman. Everyone
in Hollywood loved her.

703
00:45:00,990 --> 00:45:02,950
It’s a shame she quit so early.

704
00:45:03,159 --> 00:45:05,536
Oh, she keeps very busy.

705
00:45:05,912 --> 00:45:08,664
She could never adjust
to how movies are shot

706
00:45:08,873 --> 00:45:10,833
in bits and pieces.

707
00:45:11,542 --> 00:45:14,545
I remember escorting her to the premiere

708
00:45:14,712 --> 00:45:17,131
of her first big Hollywood movie.

709
00:45:17,298 --> 00:45:18,799
A fantastic evening.

710
00:45:18,966 --> 00:45:20,593
When the film ended,

711
00:45:20,718 --> 00:45:24,430
she looked at the screen,
then turned to me and said...

712
00:45:24,555 --> 00:45:27,558
“I did all that? All I
remember is the waiting.”

713
00:45:27,725 --> 00:45:28,851
It’s so true.

714
00:45:29,060 --> 00:45:32,939
I’m not yelling. I’m very calm.
But I say you’re on the make.

715
00:45:33,064 --> 00:45:36,359
- That’s not true.
- Oh, no? I’m a wreck.

716
00:45:36,525 --> 00:45:40,738
I’m worried all the time. I
can’t wait to finish a scene

717
00:45:40,905 --> 00:45:44,367
so I can come looking for
you. I’m a complete wreck.

718
00:45:44,742 --> 00:45:46,535
I can’t find Alphonse.

719
00:45:46,702 --> 00:45:48,496
I know where he is.

720
00:45:48,621 --> 00:45:52,750
It’s casting a shadow.
Move it to the right.

721
00:45:53,751 --> 00:45:56,587
I’m anxious the whole time I’m shooting.

722
00:45:57,672 --> 00:46:01,050
You think I can perform now like this?

723
00:46:01,175 --> 00:46:03,761
I need to be calm for this scene.

724
00:46:04,095 --> 00:46:06,847
If I blow this scene, it’s your fault.

725
00:46:17,108 --> 00:46:19,860
Sorry to make you die again.

726
00:46:19,986 --> 00:46:21,612
I’m used to it.

727
00:46:21,779 --> 00:46:24,448
In 80 films, I’ve died 24 times.

728
00:46:24,573 --> 00:46:27,451
Electrocuted twice, hanged twice,

729
00:46:27,618 --> 00:46:30,621
stabbed a few times, a couple suicides,

730
00:46:30,746 --> 00:46:34,125
lots of fatal accidents
- but never a natural death.

731
00:46:34,292 --> 00:46:37,712
Which is fine, because I
don’t think death is natural.

732
00:46:42,174 --> 00:46:45,261
Julie will be right
down. She’s changing.

733
00:46:45,428 --> 00:46:48,097
- Did things go well?
- I’m very pleased.

734
00:46:48,264 --> 00:46:51,851
I’d never worked with an
actress I hadn’t met before.

735
00:46:51,976 --> 00:46:55,521
But Julie’s just right
- determined yet fragile.

736
00:46:55,646 --> 00:46:57,732
She’s perfect for the role.

737
00:46:57,898 --> 00:47:00,276
It’ll go fine. See you later.

738
00:47:40,149 --> 00:47:43,527
- Sorry to keep you waiting, Stacey.
- That’s okay.

739
00:47:43,652 --> 00:47:46,030
I’ll just be five minutes, Bernard.

740
00:47:46,864 --> 00:47:49,200
You won’t miss your plane.

741
00:47:49,325 --> 00:47:51,869
I better not. I’ve got a TV show.

742
00:47:52,912 --> 00:47:55,873
- Hi, Yann and Martine.
- Hi, everyone.

743
00:47:57,541 --> 00:47:59,877
Ready with the pool scene?

744
00:48:00,044 --> 00:48:01,712
Let’s run it.

745
00:48:05,925 --> 00:48:09,470
Stacey, would you mind taking a letter?

746
00:48:09,595 --> 00:48:12,681
It must go out today.
- Coming, sir.

747
00:48:17,603 --> 00:48:20,523
- It doesn’t show at all.
- Really? Good.

748
00:48:20,856 --> 00:48:23,359
- Very nice.
- As long as you’re happy.

749
00:48:23,651 --> 00:48:25,069
It’s not too...?

750
00:48:25,194 --> 00:48:26,862
No, it’s fine.

751
00:48:32,326 --> 00:48:35,371
- Then it’s okay?
- You can leave with no worries.

752
00:48:37,248 --> 00:48:38,791
Have a nice trip.

753
00:48:41,627 --> 00:48:43,712
- Have a good trip.
- Good luck with the film!

754
00:48:43,838 --> 00:48:45,589
Let’s run the rest.

755
00:48:57,601 --> 00:48:59,937
Julie Baker and Alexandre

756
00:49:00,062 --> 00:49:02,648
to the bungalow set
in 15 minutes, please.

757
00:49:07,111 --> 00:49:08,362
Know what?

758
00:49:08,529 --> 00:49:10,614
I want to touch you.

759
00:49:11,407 --> 00:49:14,452
What’s that set?
- The love nest.

760
00:49:14,952 --> 00:49:18,372
It’s in the script.
- I never read scripts.

761
00:49:18,539 --> 00:49:22,251
It’s after Alexandre
and Pamela have run off.

762
00:49:23,043 --> 00:49:25,546
They stop at one of those places

763
00:49:25,671 --> 00:49:28,132
that caters to couples who... you know.

764
00:49:28,299 --> 00:49:30,801
It’s morning, and
they want to make love,

765
00:49:30,968 --> 00:49:34,847
so she sets the tray outside
so the maid won’t disturb them.

766
00:49:34,972 --> 00:49:38,309
I gotta go, and you’re
not in this scene.

767
00:49:38,976 --> 00:49:41,312
I’m hanging around anyway.

768
00:49:41,478 --> 00:49:44,565
Jean-Francois, I just
have a quick question:

769
00:49:44,690 --> 00:49:46,483
Are women magic?

770
00:49:46,609 --> 00:49:48,569
No, and neither are men.

771
00:49:48,694 --> 00:49:51,322
If a woman says she’s
known exceptional men,

772
00:49:51,489 --> 00:49:53,991
it just means she’s laid a lot of guys.

773
00:49:56,410 --> 00:49:58,871
You can check the
frame in the viewfinder.

774
00:49:58,996 --> 00:50:00,748
Excuse me, sir.

775
00:50:05,836 --> 00:50:08,464
I have to take three days off.

776
00:50:08,589 --> 00:50:11,425
Really? Are you leaving the crew?

777
00:50:11,675 --> 00:50:13,510
My mother just died.

778
00:50:13,719 --> 00:50:15,888
I see. Was it sudden?

779
00:50:16,013 --> 00:50:19,642
No, she’d suffered a long
time. She’s better off now.

780
00:50:19,767 --> 00:50:24,104
- I see. Take the time, of course.
- Someone will fill in for me.

781
00:50:24,230 --> 00:50:26,649
I understand. I’m sure they will.

782
00:50:28,400 --> 00:50:31,028
think we can start now.

783
00:50:33,489 --> 00:50:36,867
Come back, Doctor.
You’re not in the way.

784
00:50:37,034 --> 00:50:40,996
Have a seat. This shot should be fun.

785
00:50:41,247 --> 00:50:45,000
I just came to say good-bye.
My plane leaves in an hour.

786
00:50:45,125 --> 00:50:47,753
I’m going to the airport
after this. I’ll take you.

787
00:50:48,587 --> 00:50:51,006
What are we waiting for now?

788
00:50:51,131 --> 00:50:53,133
Bernard, as usual.

789
00:50:53,259 --> 00:50:55,344
No, I’m ready.

790
00:50:57,388 --> 00:51:01,642
This one’s poison,
this one’s the antidote.

791
00:51:04,436 --> 00:51:06,981
All right, we can start.

792
00:51:07,106 --> 00:51:09,108
Ready, Alexandre? Julie?

793
00:51:09,233 --> 00:51:10,734
Roll camera!

794
00:51:12,528 --> 00:51:13,529
Action!

795
00:51:20,953 --> 00:51:23,539
Don’t make the kiss too romantic.

796
00:51:39,680 --> 00:51:40,723
Now the cat.

797
00:51:48,105 --> 00:51:50,274
Go on.

798
00:51:54,361 --> 00:51:57,364
Your stupid mic is scaring it.

799
00:51:57,489 --> 00:51:59,658
We’ll dub in cat sounds later.

800
00:51:59,783 --> 00:52:01,619
At the fish market!

801
00:52:01,744 --> 00:52:04,163
Once more. Roll camera!

802
00:52:05,789 --> 00:52:07,791
Send the cat in.

803
00:52:08,709 --> 00:52:10,836
Make it go there.

804
00:52:11,003 --> 00:52:12,504
Ah, hell!

805
00:52:12,629 --> 00:52:14,423
Cut. Once more.

806
00:52:14,590 --> 00:52:16,342
Do it this time or else.

807
00:52:16,467 --> 00:52:18,385
Walter, follow the cat.

808
00:52:18,761 --> 00:52:20,429
Send the cat in.

809
00:52:22,431 --> 00:52:23,849
What’s the problem?

810
00:52:23,974 --> 00:52:26,435
I swear it hasn’t eaten, in three days.

811
00:52:27,728 --> 00:52:29,772
Toss it right in there.

812
00:52:34,193 --> 00:52:37,946
Cut. We’ll shoot the
scene when you find a cat

813
00:52:38,072 --> 00:52:39,448
that can act.

814
00:52:39,573 --> 00:52:41,617
I told you to get two cats.

815
00:52:43,994 --> 00:52:45,788
Miss
Know-it-all.

816
00:53:05,015 --> 00:53:07,309
It could be 20 minutes.

817
00:53:07,434 --> 00:53:10,270
I still have to remove my makeup.

818
00:53:10,396 --> 00:53:13,023
Why didn’t you do it?

819
00:53:13,148 --> 00:53:15,234
And I get yelled at!

820
00:53:15,526 --> 00:53:17,277
Where did Joelle go?

821
00:53:17,528 --> 00:53:20,197
I found one. It’s the studio cat.

822
00:53:20,364 --> 00:53:23,117
I can tell just by looking

823
00:53:23,242 --> 00:53:25,244
that it’s not gonna perform.

824
00:53:25,411 --> 00:53:27,830
Stop arguing. We’ll try the studio cat.

825
00:53:29,873 --> 00:53:32,835
- Places, everyone.
- The kiss.

826
00:53:33,502 --> 00:53:34,503
The tray.

827
00:53:37,214 --> 00:53:39,007
Get ready for the door.

828
00:53:42,177 --> 00:53:44,138
Send the cat in.

829
00:53:54,398 --> 00:53:56,233
Fix the focus!

830
00:54:14,376 --> 00:54:16,545
Keep the cat in focus, damn it!

831
00:54:25,929 --> 00:54:27,556
Cut!

832
00:54:41,361 --> 00:54:45,282
Alexandre, I know you’re in a hurry,

833
00:54:45,449 --> 00:54:47,576
but I have a quick question.

834
00:54:48,535 --> 00:54:51,663
In your opinion, are women magic?

835
00:54:54,291 --> 00:54:56,001
Some are, yes.

836
00:54:56,502 --> 00:54:58,212
But some aren’t!

837
00:55:15,103 --> 00:55:18,023
You needn’t worry about Julie.

838
00:55:18,190 --> 00:55:21,151
I know. She’s very happy on this film.

839
00:55:21,318 --> 00:55:23,153
I’m sure she’ll do fine.

840
00:55:23,320 --> 00:55:26,823
- Actors are so vulnerable.
- It’s only natural.

841
00:55:27,491 --> 00:55:29,827
Everyone’s afraid of being judged,

842
00:55:29,952 --> 00:55:31,787
but in your profession...

843
00:55:32,162 --> 00:55:34,706
being judged is part and parcel

844
00:55:34,832 --> 00:55:37,626
of your work and your personal life.

845
00:55:37,960 --> 00:55:41,296
We meet someone and immediately
think, “Do they love me?”

846
00:55:42,381 --> 00:55:44,550
It must be the same

847
00:55:44,675 --> 00:55:46,385
for all artists.

848
00:55:47,636 --> 00:55:51,223
As a child, when Mozart was
asked to play, he’d reply...

849
00:55:51,348 --> 00:55:54,851
“Gladly, but first tell me you love me.”

850
00:55:54,977 --> 00:55:58,855
And there’s more kissing
in your job than any other.

851
00:55:59,022 --> 00:56:00,649
You noticed, huh?

852
00:56:00,774 --> 00:56:02,901
Yes, we do a lot of kissing.

853
00:56:03,652 --> 00:56:08,699
They say the handshake was invented
to show one was unarmed, not a foe.

854
00:56:08,824 --> 00:56:10,492
That’s not enough for us.

855
00:56:10,867 --> 00:56:13,120
We have to show we love each other.

856
00:56:13,370 --> 00:56:16,623
“My darling, my love,
you’re so wonderful.”

857
00:56:17,666 --> 00:56:19,459
We need that.

858
00:57:00,626 --> 00:57:04,254
This is Christian Fersen.
Our director, Mr. Ferrand.

859
00:57:04,504 --> 00:57:07,382
Were you waiting outside?
You should’ve come inside.

860
00:57:07,507 --> 00:57:09,927
I’ll be damned! You see that?

861
00:57:10,427 --> 00:57:13,013
Bernard, are women magic?

862
00:57:13,138 --> 00:57:15,474
Not women. Their legs.

863
00:57:15,599 --> 00:57:17,601
That’s why they wear skirts.

864
00:57:17,768 --> 00:57:20,437
Cut the crap. We going
to a movie tonight.

865
00:57:20,562 --> 00:57:24,066
Joelle, when’s it start?
- We gotta leave now.

866
00:57:24,191 --> 00:57:28,236
You have to shoot the
kitchen scene tomorrow night.

867
00:57:28,362 --> 00:57:31,823
The union contract calls
for a 12-hour break.

868
00:57:31,948 --> 00:57:36,119
Joelle, we have to shoot
the kitchen scene tomorrow.

869
00:57:36,244 --> 00:57:38,288
Can you work with me tonight?

870
00:57:38,455 --> 00:57:40,749
I can’t go to the movies.

871
00:57:40,874 --> 00:57:43,126
I hear we’re shooting the kitchen scene.

872
00:57:43,293 --> 00:57:45,462
Yes, we have to. Tomorrow night.

873
00:57:45,629 --> 00:57:49,257
- I’d like to get my lines.
- Tonight after dinner.

874
00:57:49,424 --> 00:57:52,469
- That’s cutting it close.
- It’s not written yet.

875
00:57:52,594 --> 00:57:55,430
Read it once, then put
it under your pillow.

876
00:57:55,597 --> 00:57:58,350
In the morning you’ll know it by heart.

877
00:57:58,475 --> 00:58:00,310
Optimist!

878
00:58:03,355 --> 00:58:06,983
Reporters always ask the same questions.

879
00:58:07,109 --> 00:58:09,236
“How’s it feel to be famous,

880
00:58:09,361 --> 00:58:12,656
to be asked for autographs,
recognized in public?”

881
00:58:12,823 --> 00:58:15,867
But no TV program I’ve
seen has ever shown

882
00:58:15,993 --> 00:58:18,036
that an actress on a film shoot

883
00:58:18,161 --> 00:58:20,372
gets up at 6:00 a.m.

884
00:58:20,497 --> 00:58:22,999
and gets home at 9:00 p.m. -

885
00:58:23,125 --> 00:58:25,001
a 15-hour workday!

886
00:58:25,127 --> 00:58:27,212
Not really 15.

887
00:58:27,379 --> 00:58:30,507
Maybe 13-14 if you go to the rushes.

888
00:58:30,674 --> 00:58:32,134
All right.

889
00:58:32,259 --> 00:58:35,470
Madame Severine isn’t in
her room. I’ll try the bar.

890
00:58:40,350 --> 00:58:44,021
The Godfather is at the
Kursaal, the Rexy, the Forum.

891
00:58:44,146 --> 00:58:46,398
No other film has a chance.

892
00:58:46,523 --> 00:58:50,110
Speaking of godfathers,
how about that Alexandre?

893
00:58:50,235 --> 00:58:53,405
He fooled everybody. We
all expected a Lolita,

894
00:58:53,530 --> 00:58:56,825
and a handsome Romeo got off the plane.

895
00:58:56,950 --> 00:58:58,493
I was thinking:

896
00:58:58,618 --> 00:59:01,788
Maybe he could do Pamela’s
car-accident stunt.

897
00:59:01,913 --> 00:59:05,709
You crazy? Too dangerous!
That takes a real stuntman.

898
00:59:05,876 --> 00:59:08,670
Let’s get back to the kitchen scene.

899
00:59:08,795 --> 00:59:12,299
That night, Alexandre
finds Pamela in the kitchen.

900
00:59:12,424 --> 00:59:13,800
Why the kitchen?

901
00:59:13,967 --> 00:59:17,262
Anywhere else might seem suspicious.

902
00:59:17,387 --> 00:59:20,098
I’m not too happy with my first draft.

903
00:59:20,223 --> 00:59:22,851
He: “You realize what’s
happening to us, don’t you?”

904
00:59:22,976 --> 00:59:25,187
She: “I think I do.” That’s no good.

905
00:59:25,312 --> 00:59:29,775
Pamela has to be sure, or her
character will seem spineless.

906
00:59:29,900 --> 00:59:33,945
The scene isn’t working.
Why not call Jean-Marius?

907
00:59:34,071 --> 00:59:37,741
I thought of it, but he’s in Japan.

908
00:59:38,366 --> 00:59:41,286
He’s adapting Turgenev’s First Love,

909
00:59:41,411 --> 00:59:44,247
setting it in modern
Japan, a great idea.

910
00:59:44,372 --> 00:59:46,958
Better than Pamela. I
should have done that.

911
00:59:47,083 --> 00:59:49,878
Though you can make
a film about anything.

912
00:59:50,003 --> 00:59:52,631
“Kissinger’s Successful Mission,”

913
00:59:52,756 --> 00:59:55,675
“Heart Transplant,”
“Jeweler Stabs Wife.”

914
00:59:55,884 --> 00:59:58,470
Back to work. You dictate, I’ll type.

915
00:59:58,678 --> 01:00:01,306
You promised Julie her lines tonight.

916
01:00:01,431 --> 01:00:03,600
Okay, back to the kitchen.

917
01:00:03,767 --> 01:00:07,229
Let’s ditch any sense of
shame or sneaking around.

918
01:00:07,354 --> 01:00:11,399
They very consciously decide to
run away like thieves in the night.

919
01:00:11,525 --> 01:00:14,528
She could even say that.
“Like thieves in the night.”

920
01:00:14,694 --> 01:00:17,614
We must show she knows
exactly what she’s doing.

921
01:00:17,781 --> 01:00:21,118
She once loved the son, but
now she loves the father.

922
01:00:21,243 --> 01:00:23,203
That has to come across.

923
01:00:23,328 --> 01:00:25,455
Julie put it very well.

924
01:00:25,622 --> 01:00:28,750
Here’s her interview
in the morning paper.

925
01:00:28,875 --> 01:00:32,128
“The girl realizes the boy she’s married

926
01:00:32,295 --> 01:00:35,173
is but a pale reflection of his father.”

927
01:00:35,340 --> 01:00:38,093
She’s the only one
who really got it. Why?

928
01:00:38,218 --> 01:00:41,888
Because her mother was an actress,
and because she knows Hollywood,

929
01:00:42,055 --> 01:00:45,725
where lots of kids try to live
up to their famous parents:

930
01:00:45,851 --> 01:00:48,687
Fairbanks, Barrymore, and on and on.

931
01:00:48,812 --> 01:00:52,816
Alexandre: “You realize what’s
happening to us, don’t you?”

932
01:00:52,941 --> 01:00:54,818
Damn, the phone.

933
01:00:58,196 --> 01:01:01,700
Mr. Ferrand, a Miss Dominique
is here. Should she come up?

934
01:01:01,867 --> 01:01:05,287
Tell her I’m working.
I’ll call her tomorrow.

935
01:01:05,412 --> 01:01:07,080
I’ll give her the message.

936
01:01:07,205 --> 01:01:10,625
He’s sorry, but he has to work tonight.

937
01:01:10,750 --> 01:01:12,794
He’ll call you tomorrow.

938
01:01:13,003 --> 01:01:15,172
- What do you think?
- Sexpot?

939
01:01:15,505 --> 01:01:18,008
- Riviera beauty?
- Local call girl?

940
01:01:18,174 --> 01:01:20,218
A little R&R?
- Exactly.

941
01:01:20,343 --> 01:01:22,637
Hey, it’s the movie quiz!

942
01:01:25,348 --> 01:01:29,019
In what film based on Shakespeare
did Jeanne Moreau costar

943
01:01:29,186 --> 01:01:31,229
with Orson We lies?

944
01:01:31,438 --> 01:01:32,731
Falstaff.

945
01:01:32,898 --> 01:01:34,316
Correct.

946
01:01:34,441 --> 01:01:37,193
in what film did she
play Charles IX’s sister

947
01:01:37,319 --> 01:01:39,237
and wife o[the king of Navarre?

948
01:01:39,404 --> 01:01:42,991
- That thing with Henry
IV - - La reine Margot.

949
01:01:43,116 --> 01:01:44,326
You know your stuff.

950
01:01:45,076 --> 01:01:47,787
Julie, your lines for tomorrow.

951
01:02:03,511 --> 01:02:05,722
“Yes, I’m in love with you.”

952
01:02:07,682 --> 01:02:11,144
“Same as you, I think: ever
since the costume party.”

953
01:02:11,519 --> 01:02:14,898
“I can’t stay here. I’ve
decided to leave tomorrow.”

954
01:02:22,072 --> 01:02:24,699
“Ever since the costume party...”

955
01:03:04,656 --> 01:03:06,700
close the window.

956
01:03:06,908 --> 01:03:10,495
Just one thing: Don’t get
sentimental in this scene.

957
01:03:10,662 --> 01:03:13,289
Keep it blunt, almost aggressive.

958
01:03:13,415 --> 01:03:15,667
The rehearsal was good.

959
01:03:15,792 --> 01:03:18,003
Let’s do a take.

960
01:03:19,879 --> 01:03:22,799
Lights out. Rain.

961
01:03:22,924 --> 01:03:24,551
Less rain.

962
01:03:26,052 --> 01:03:27,804
Hold it there.

963
01:03:41,735 --> 01:03:43,653
Can’t you sleep?

964
01:03:44,320 --> 01:03:47,490
I heard someone. I knew it was you.

965
01:03:48,074 --> 01:03:50,243
You couldn’t sleep either.

966
01:03:50,368 --> 01:03:52,495
I was thinking of you.

967
01:03:53,496 --> 01:03:56,291
You realize what’s
happening to us, don’t you?

968
01:03:57,751 --> 01:04:00,170
Yes. I’m in love with you.

969
01:04:01,296 --> 01:04:03,465
How long have you known?

970
01:04:04,507 --> 01:04:07,886
Same as you, I think: ever
since the costume party.

971
01:04:09,095 --> 01:04:12,515
I can’t stay here. I’ve
decided to leave tomorrow.

972
01:04:13,350 --> 01:04:15,060
I thought of that too...

973
01:04:15,268 --> 01:04:17,270
but I want us to leave together.

974
01:04:17,479 --> 01:04:20,774
No, that would be like
running off together.

975
01:04:20,940 --> 01:04:24,027
Yes, it would. I realize that.

976
01:04:25,028 --> 01:04:27,238
But I don’t want to lose you.

977
01:04:29,282 --> 01:04:33,119
Nor I you. Let’s leave right
now, like thieves in the night.

978
01:04:34,079 --> 01:04:36,039
Cut. How was it, Walter?

979
01:04:36,206 --> 01:04:39,375
Fine. Perfect. What do we do next?

980
01:04:39,709 --> 01:04:41,336
We do it again.

981
01:04:51,763 --> 01:04:54,933
Let’s leave right now,
like thieves in the night...

982
01:04:55,892 --> 01:04:58,353
Like thieves...

983
01:05:12,409 --> 01:05:14,661
We’ve been looking for you for an hour!

984
01:05:14,869 --> 01:05:17,414
I was in my dressing room.

985
01:05:17,580 --> 01:05:19,833
But you were told last night.

986
01:05:19,999 --> 01:05:23,753
No, or I’d have been here.
I didn’t get a call sheet.

987
01:05:23,878 --> 01:05:26,005
Fine. Let’s get started.

988
01:05:26,965 --> 01:05:29,008
We’re at the halfway point.

989
01:05:29,175 --> 01:05:32,262
Before starting, I hope
to make a fine film.

990
01:05:32,387 --> 01:05:35,223
When the first problems
arise, I lower my sights

991
01:05:35,348 --> 01:05:37,934
and hope to just get through it.

992
01:05:38,059 --> 01:05:40,937
Halfway through, I do some
soul-searching and think...

993
01:05:41,062 --> 01:05:43,648
“You could have worked
harder, given more.

994
01:05:43,773 --> 01:05:46,526
You have the second half
1 to make up for it.”

995
01:05:46,651 --> 01:05:50,488
And I start trying harder
to bring the film to life.

996
01:05:51,406 --> 01:05:54,117
Meet Pamela finally
seems on the right track.

997
01:05:54,284 --> 01:05:57,453
The actors are into their rotes,
the crew has come together,

998
01:05:57,620 --> 01:06:00,248
personal problems have been
resolved. Cinema is king.

999
01:08:15,758 --> 01:08:19,262
The drinks are on Alexandre tonight!

1000
01:08:22,265 --> 01:08:24,434
Any champagne left?

1001
01:08:24,600 --> 01:08:27,186
No, we’ll have to switch to Pernod.

1002
01:08:30,356 --> 01:08:32,442
Make yourselves at home.

1003
01:08:32,775 --> 01:08:34,694
Help yourselves.

1004
01:08:34,819 --> 01:08:37,071
You were in Paris then?

1005
01:08:37,196 --> 01:08:39,991
For you. I see you’re set.

1006
01:08:42,243 --> 01:08:45,121
He’s very handsome. Does
he want to be in movies?

1007
01:08:45,288 --> 01:08:48,124
My God, no! He wants no part of it.

1008
01:08:48,249 --> 01:08:50,460
But his tennis is going well.

1009
01:08:50,585 --> 01:08:52,628
In that case, auguri!

1010
01:08:55,173 --> 01:08:57,925
But I wanted to ask you something.

1011
01:08:58,509 --> 01:09:01,304
I’ve decided to adopt Christian.

1012
01:09:01,638 --> 01:09:04,182
You know I’ve always wanted a son.

1013
01:09:04,307 --> 01:09:06,643
And you’ll think it silly,

1014
01:09:06,809 --> 01:09:10,438
but I’d like someone to carry
on my name when I’m gone.

1015
01:09:10,563 --> 01:09:12,106
It’s a wonderful idea.

1016
01:09:12,315 --> 01:09:15,443
But there are some legal issues.

1017
01:09:15,818 --> 01:09:17,695
I’m not married now,

1018
01:09:17,820 --> 01:09:20,239
and he doesn’t have a French passport.

1019
01:09:20,615 --> 01:09:22,116
Know what you should do?

1020
01:09:22,784 --> 01:09:24,827
Speak to the president.

1021
01:09:24,952 --> 01:09:28,623
The electrician’s grandfather.

1022
01:09:29,374 --> 01:09:30,458
Go fish.

1023
01:09:30,583 --> 01:09:32,835
The cameraman’s mother.

1024
01:09:36,005 --> 01:09:38,091
This is Mark Spencer.

1025
01:09:38,883 --> 01:09:41,761
The British stuntman,
just in from London.

1026
01:09:41,886 --> 01:09:44,680
He speaks no French.
- Julie will help.

1027
01:09:46,015 --> 01:09:50,019
Tell him the car crash
we’re shooting tomorrow

1028
01:09:50,186 --> 01:09:53,523
will be in nuit americaine.
- What’s that?

1029
01:09:53,648 --> 01:09:58,194
A night scene shot in daylight,
using a filter on the lens.

1030
01:09:58,319 --> 01:10:01,572
That’s called “day
for night” in English.

1031
01:10:10,498 --> 01:10:12,500
Yes, dressed just like that.

1032
01:10:14,502 --> 01:10:16,045
He doesn’t understand.

1033
01:10:16,254 --> 01:10:18,923
I speak it very well,
but I don’t understand.

1034
01:10:22,510 --> 01:10:24,929
Liliane, stay here with me this morning.

1035
01:10:25,096 --> 01:10:26,639
Are you crazy?

1036
01:10:26,806 --> 01:10:29,559
They don’t need you.
What are they shooting?

1037
01:10:29,725 --> 01:10:33,354
Pamela’s death in the car,
with the English stuntman.

1038
01:10:33,479 --> 01:10:35,898
See? It’s not an important scene.

1039
01:10:36,065 --> 01:10:38,067
I’ve gotta go. They’re all down there.

1040
01:10:38,234 --> 01:10:42,071
Follow me. You can’t miss
the road. It’s marked.

1041
01:10:43,197 --> 01:10:44,657
See you later.

1042
01:10:46,742 --> 01:10:49,620
Where’d you get this watch?

1043
01:10:49,745 --> 01:10:53,082
Pierrot lent it to
me. Mine’s being fixed.

1044
01:10:53,207 --> 01:10:55,251
Give it back.

1045
01:10:55,376 --> 01:10:58,337
I can afford a watch if you need one.

1046
01:11:03,092 --> 01:11:05,803
- Making it hard for me to leave?
- No, go on.

1047
01:11:05,970 --> 01:11:08,848
But that’s mine. Keep it for me.

1048
01:11:09,015 --> 01:11:10,016
I will.

1049
01:11:10,600 --> 01:11:13,352
Come on, guys! Move it!

1050
01:11:33,956 --> 01:11:36,417
- What are you doing today?
- What about you?

1051
01:11:36,542 --> 01:11:39,587
I’m going antique hunting.

1052
01:11:39,712 --> 01:11:41,005
I’m going to a movie.

1053
01:12:24,549 --> 01:12:26,342
What’s wrong?

1054
01:12:26,592 --> 01:12:28,511
I got a damned flat.

1055
01:12:28,678 --> 01:12:32,014
And I suppose you can’t change a tire.

1056
01:12:32,181 --> 01:12:35,017
Come on, just help. We’ll be late.

1057
01:12:35,184 --> 01:12:39,188
No need for a man when the
car’s cruising along fine.

1058
01:12:39,355 --> 01:12:40,356
We’ll be late.

1059
01:12:40,523 --> 01:12:42,608
Move. This goes up front.

1060
01:12:42,817 --> 01:12:46,070
I see you’ve never used a jack.
- I’m not a mechanic.

1061
01:12:46,195 --> 01:12:49,532
Neither am I, but what
if you run out of gas?

1062
01:12:49,699 --> 01:12:51,534
Then I put some in.

1063
01:12:51,701 --> 01:12:53,828
In the carburetor, I bet.

1064
01:12:53,953 --> 01:12:55,997
There. Now we’re all filthy.

1065
01:12:56,163 --> 01:12:58,291
I’ll change into my sweater.

1066
01:13:02,545 --> 01:13:04,046
Hold this.

1067
01:13:06,382 --> 01:13:08,885
Listen, if you’re in the mood...

1068
01:13:09,051 --> 01:13:10,052
For what?

1069
01:13:10,386 --> 01:13:13,222
Well, we’re... all alone.

1070
01:13:13,556 --> 01:13:15,266
Okay, you’re on.

1071
01:13:15,391 --> 01:13:16,726
W- What?

1072
01:13:16,892 --> 01:13:20,938
I see you’re all talk and no action.

1073
01:13:21,397 --> 01:13:23,900
- You mean, you want to...?
- Sure.

1074
01:13:24,066 --> 01:13:26,360
But we haven’t got all day.

1075
01:13:32,908 --> 01:13:34,910
Come on, hurry up.

1076
01:13:39,248 --> 01:13:41,250
What’s happened to Joelle?

1077
01:13:41,459 --> 01:13:43,544
She’s not here, and neither is Bernard.

1078
01:13:45,296 --> 01:13:48,674
You guys could have this
blow-up doll in your car.

1079
01:13:49,967 --> 01:13:51,761
Or in your bathtub.

1080
01:13:51,928 --> 01:13:54,597
You’re disgusting. If
he understood French,

1081
01:13:54,764 --> 01:13:57,475
he’d slug you one, and
it’d serve you right.

1082
01:13:57,600 --> 01:14:00,269
Hurry! Is that what you
learned in film school?

1083
01:14:00,436 --> 01:14:04,315
Bunch of perverts,
talking dirty all day long.

1084
01:14:04,440 --> 01:14:07,485
Whatcha doin’, makin’ a movie?

1085
01:14:07,693 --> 01:14:10,321
If ya need stars, we’re available.

1086
01:14:10,613 --> 01:14:12,823
Let the workers by.

1087
01:14:14,659 --> 01:14:16,911
We’re all peasants, right?

1088
01:14:17,036 --> 01:14:21,082
- Right, we’re all peasants.
- No, we’re all Jewish peasants.

1089
01:14:22,458 --> 01:14:26,170
Hey, Pierrot, heard
from your wife and kids?

1090
01:14:27,254 --> 01:14:30,633
- Glad you could make it, guys!
- I got a flat.

1091
01:14:30,758 --> 01:14:34,345
Good thing I was behind
her or she’d still be there.

1092
01:14:35,137 --> 01:14:36,972
Fill me in.

1093
01:14:38,808 --> 01:14:41,644
Continuity slip. You changed.

1094
01:14:41,769 --> 01:14:43,646
Ready to shoot!

1095
01:15:24,687 --> 01:15:27,565
Okay, second camera?

1096
01:15:27,690 --> 01:15:29,734
- And the stuntman?
- He’s all done.

1097
01:15:29,859 --> 01:15:32,403
Then he can pack up and go.

1098
01:15:39,535 --> 01:15:41,036
What’s going on?

1099
01:15:41,162 --> 01:15:43,914
He promised me a ride
but took Liliane instead.

1100
01:15:44,039 --> 01:15:45,541
Fast worker!

1101
01:16:09,940 --> 01:16:12,151
What’s all this luggage?

1102
01:16:14,278 --> 01:16:16,280
I might as well tell you.

1103
01:16:18,199 --> 01:16:20,576
We’re in love.

1104
01:16:20,701 --> 01:16:23,079
He’s taking me to London.

1105
01:16:23,204 --> 01:16:24,538
The film’s not finished.

1106
01:16:24,663 --> 01:16:28,375
They’ll do fine without
me. I’m just a fifth wheel.

1107
01:16:28,501 --> 01:16:30,753
You don’t just walk out on a film.

1108
01:16:30,878 --> 01:16:33,130
They only hired me for Alphonse’s sake.

1109
01:16:33,255 --> 01:16:34,715
And what’s he say?

1110
01:16:34,840 --> 01:16:37,718
He’ll get the surprise tonight.

1111
01:16:37,843 --> 01:16:39,595
He’ll be terribly upset.

1112
01:16:39,720 --> 01:16:41,931
He’s always terribly upset.

1113
01:16:42,097 --> 01:16:44,767
He’s a spoiled child
who refuses to grow up.

1114
01:16:44,892 --> 01:16:47,895
He loves you. You were to be married.

1115
01:16:48,020 --> 01:16:50,397
He mentioned marriage, not me.

1116
01:16:50,564 --> 01:16:52,900
Just the word gives me the creeps.

1117
01:16:53,067 --> 01:16:55,653
He needs a wife, a mistress,

1118
01:16:55,778 --> 01:16:58,572
a nanny, a nurse, a sister.

1119
01:16:58,697 --> 01:17:00,950
I can’t play all those roles.

1120
01:17:01,075 --> 01:17:04,954
This is wrong. You don’t
realize how cruel you’re being.

1121
01:17:05,120 --> 01:17:07,248
I’m through with Alphonse.

1122
01:17:08,624 --> 01:17:12,503
He expects the whole world to
pay for his unhappy childhood.

1123
01:17:17,758 --> 01:17:20,469
Julie, come be in the picture!

1124
01:17:22,680 --> 01:17:24,014
What picture?

1125
01:17:24,140 --> 01:17:27,852
A souvenir for me. It’s my last day.

1126
01:17:30,479 --> 01:17:32,898
Wait. Here comes Stacey.

1127
01:17:34,525 --> 01:17:36,777
Hi, Bernard. How are you?

1128
01:17:36,902 --> 01:17:39,196
We’re all waiting for you.

1129
01:17:42,908 --> 01:17:45,661
Come, Stacey. We’re proud of you.

1130
01:17:45,828 --> 01:17:49,498
Stand right there.
Looks like it’s due soon.

1131
01:17:49,623 --> 01:17:52,334
And it’s not even twins.

1132
01:17:52,501 --> 01:17:56,589
She’s lucky. She’ll get
nothing but close-ups!

1133
01:17:58,299 --> 01:17:59,550
Hold still.

1134
01:18:00,176 --> 01:18:03,596
Wait, we’re missing
Liliane. Where is she?

1135
01:18:04,680 --> 01:18:06,849
I have to talk to you.

1136
01:18:10,185 --> 01:18:12,021
Liliane won’t be coming.

1137
01:18:28,204 --> 01:18:30,247
She was right to leave.

1138
01:18:30,456 --> 01:18:33,375
I understand. It had to end this way.

1139
01:18:35,252 --> 01:18:36,086
Don’t move.

1140
01:18:36,211 --> 01:18:38,589
Now Alphonse has disappeared!

1141
01:18:41,634 --> 01:18:44,136
And where’s Odile?

1142
01:18:44,720 --> 01:18:47,097
What happened?

1143
01:18:47,223 --> 01:18:49,516
Liliane ran off with the stuntman.

1144
01:18:49,725 --> 01:18:51,685
Does Alphonse know?

1145
01:18:51,810 --> 01:18:53,812
I had to tell him.

1146
01:18:54,063 --> 01:18:55,606
The stuntman!

1147
01:18:55,731 --> 01:18:59,526
I’d dump a guy for a film
but never a film for a guy!

1148
01:21:06,028 --> 01:21:07,863
Can you manage?

1149
01:21:09,865 --> 01:21:11,992
I’ll explain the setup.

1150
01:21:12,284 --> 01:21:16,538
We built this to suggest you’re
staying across from your in-laws.

1151
01:21:17,206 --> 01:21:19,041
We can start now.

1152
01:21:20,334 --> 01:21:22,377
I’ll cue you, since Alphonse isn’t here.

1153
01:21:22,544 --> 01:21:24,880
Alphonse’s love life -what a mess!

1154
01:21:25,047 --> 01:21:27,925
True. One day I’ll make
a film: “A Lovely Mess.”

1155
01:21:28,050 --> 01:21:29,343
Action, Julie.

1156
01:21:29,468 --> 01:21:31,053
Hello, kids!

1157
01:21:31,470 --> 01:21:34,890
Alphonse, hurry up!

1158
01:21:37,142 --> 01:21:39,436
Come have breakfast with us.

1159
01:21:39,561 --> 01:21:41,063
Alphonse is still in bed.

1160
01:21:41,188 --> 01:21:42,564
Next line, Julie.

1161
01:21:42,731 --> 01:21:45,984
- We’re invited over.
- Tell them okay.

1162
01:21:46,110 --> 01:21:47,820
We’ll be right there.

1163
01:21:47,986 --> 01:21:49,446
Cut. Once more.

1164
01:21:52,866 --> 01:21:55,494
Come have breakfast with us.

1165
01:21:55,619 --> 01:21:57,371
Alphonse is still asleep.

1166
01:21:57,496 --> 01:21:59,248
No, “in bed.”

1167
01:21:59,373 --> 01:22:01,667
We’re invited over.

1168
01:23:11,653 --> 01:23:13,947
Alphonse, I know you’re in there.

1169
01:23:14,072 --> 01:23:16,325
Open up. Everyone’s asking for you.

1170
01:23:16,491 --> 01:23:17,910
They are not!

1171
01:23:18,035 --> 01:23:20,245
They are. Severine’s leaving tonight.

1172
01:23:20,370 --> 01:23:23,457
I don’t want to see anyone! You hear me?

1173
01:23:25,125 --> 01:23:28,378
This actor had always
dreamed of playing Hamlet.

1174
01:23:28,503 --> 01:23:32,299
He finally staged his own production.

1175
01:23:32,424 --> 01:23:35,928
But he was so bad, he
was booed every night.

1176
01:23:36,053 --> 01:23:38,639
One night he’d had enough.

1177
01:23:38,764 --> 01:23:43,644
He stopped right in the middle
of “To be or not to be...”

1178
01:23:43,810 --> 01:23:47,314
and turning to the audience, he said...

1179
01:23:56,198 --> 01:23:58,659
The champagne’s here at last!

1180
01:23:58,867 --> 01:24:01,620
Ferrand, you still
have to finish Pamela.

1181
01:24:01,745 --> 01:24:04,873
Darling, I’m so sad to be leaving.

1182
01:24:04,998 --> 01:24:07,626
Come join us, you male chauvinists.

1183
01:24:07,751 --> 01:24:10,420
Slide your table over.

1184
01:24:11,338 --> 01:24:14,883
And you, sir, why are
you all alone over there?

1185
01:24:15,050 --> 01:24:18,720
Are you sad? In love? Heartbroken?

1186
01:24:18,845 --> 01:24:21,139
You mustn’t. He’s a hotel guest.

1187
01:24:21,265 --> 01:24:22,808
So what?

1188
01:24:22,975 --> 01:24:25,561
Come join us, Mr. Hotel Guest!;

1189
01:24:26,645 --> 01:24:30,065
We’re a film crew
having a farewell party.

1190
01:24:30,232 --> 01:24:31,984
I’ll introduce you.

1191
01:24:44,162 --> 01:24:46,164
I need to talk to you.

1192
01:24:48,875 --> 01:24:51,461
I think someone should go get Alphonse.

1193
01:24:51,586 --> 01:24:55,173
He’s sulking in his room.
Besides, he’s a real pain.

1194
01:24:55,424 --> 01:24:57,718
- You’re too hard on him.
- Hard on him?

1195
01:24:57,843 --> 01:25:00,137
I’ve put up with him for ages.

1196
01:25:00,304 --> 01:25:01,763
Then I’ll go.

1197
01:25:01,930 --> 01:25:03,515
I’ll try again.

1198
01:25:03,640 --> 01:25:06,768
Julie, come look at
these marvelous pictures.

1199
01:25:09,980 --> 01:25:11,440
She’s so lovely.

1200
01:25:11,648 --> 01:25:12,816
She’s not!

1201
01:25:19,489 --> 01:25:21,491
It’s a strange life we lead.

1202
01:25:22,659 --> 01:25:25,829
We meet, we work together,

1203
01:25:26,121 --> 01:25:28,123
we grow to love each other, and then -

1204
01:25:28,290 --> 01:25:31,126
As soon as we grasp something...

1205
01:25:32,252 --> 01:25:34,963
it’s gone. Gone!

1206
01:25:36,632 --> 01:25:39,217
Severine’s an extraordinary woman.

1207
01:25:39,384 --> 01:25:41,470
We made a film together in Italy.

1208
01:25:41,678 --> 01:25:44,973
She was so good, the
director kept saying...

1209
01:25:45,098 --> 01:25:47,768
“She’s better than Eleonora Duse!”

1210
01:25:47,893 --> 01:25:51,021
So I said, “Yeah, she’s a real doozy.”

1211
01:25:51,146 --> 01:25:52,814
That’s a good one.

1212
01:25:52,981 --> 01:25:55,650
Good night, sweetheart.

1213
01:26:00,739 --> 01:26:02,491
Did you talk to Alphonse?

1214
01:26:02,616 --> 01:26:06,703
He’s locked in and won’t come
out. I didn’t even see him.

1215
01:26:06,828 --> 01:26:08,789
Well, Severine’s gone -

1216
01:26:12,834 --> 01:26:15,837
Can someone give me
money for a whorehouse?

1217
01:26:16,213 --> 01:26:18,298
Come here, Alphonse.

1218
01:26:18,590 --> 01:26:21,968
Go back to your room,
work on your lines,

1219
01:26:22,094 --> 01:26:24,137
and try to get some sleep.

1220
01:26:24,262 --> 01:26:27,474
Tomorrow’s a workday, and
it’s the work that matters.

1221
01:26:27,641 --> 01:26:29,142
Don’t be a fool.

1222
01:26:30,310 --> 01:26:32,396
You’re a very good actor.

1223
01:26:32,521 --> 01:26:35,482
No one’s personal life runs smoothly.

1224
01:26:35,691 --> 01:26:37,734
That only happens in the movies.

1225
01:26:37,901 --> 01:26:40,195
No traffic jams or useless down time.

1226
01:26:40,362 --> 01:26:43,365
Movies move along like
trains in the night.

1227
01:26:43,532 --> 01:26:45,575
And people like you and me

1228
01:26:45,700 --> 01:26:47,869
are only happy in our work.

1229
01:26:48,036 --> 01:26:50,539
Good night. I’m counting on you.

1230
01:26:55,335 --> 01:26:59,506
“Alphonse, what costume should
I choose for the party Saturday?”

1231
01:27:10,767 --> 01:27:14,271
Please put this call
through to room 415.

1232
01:27:20,026 --> 01:27:21,903
Julie, it’s Alphonse.

1233
01:27:22,154 --> 01:27:24,865
I’m leaving tonight. I
wanted to tell you first,

1234
01:27:24,990 --> 01:27:26,950
because you’ve always
been honest with me.

1235
01:27:27,075 --> 01:27:28,910
Tell Ferrand for me.

1236
01:27:29,077 --> 01:27:31,496
I have to talk to you. Wait.

1237
01:27:31,621 --> 01:27:33,123
Good-bye, and thanks.

1238
01:27:33,248 --> 01:27:34,916
Wait for me.

1239
01:27:53,310 --> 01:27:56,646
What’s all this about?
You’re not really leaving!

1240
01:27:57,272 --> 01:27:59,858
I am. I’m giving it all up.

1241
01:27:59,983 --> 01:28:03,278
No, you’re going to
stay and finish the film.

1242
01:28:03,403 --> 01:28:06,448
Even if I stayed, I
couldn’t possibly work.

1243
01:28:06,615 --> 01:28:08,617
I’m a physical wreck..

1244
01:28:09,576 --> 01:28:11,578
You think it’s normal

1245
01:28:11,703 --> 01:28:14,915
for someone to suddenly stop
loving you and just walk out?

1246
01:28:15,081 --> 01:28:17,375
Then it was all phony and rotten.

1247
01:28:17,793 --> 01:28:21,755
I know what you’re
feeling. It hurts terribly.

1248
01:28:21,880 --> 01:28:24,257
But I think Liliane still loves you.

1249
01:28:24,799 --> 01:28:27,344
Besides, you’re being selfish too.

1250
01:28:27,469 --> 01:28:29,262
You know it’s hard

1251
01:28:29,387 --> 01:28:32,349
for an outsider to live with an actor.

1252
01:28:32,557 --> 01:28:37,187
But to leave with just
anyone! Some Brit stuntman!

1253
01:28:37,312 --> 01:28:39,689
Careful! I’m a Brit too.

1254
01:28:40,106 --> 01:28:42,776
And I know all about these stuntmen.

1255
01:28:42,901 --> 01:28:46,196
It’s not hard to guess what will happen.

1256
01:28:47,280 --> 01:28:51,076
At first, he’ll take
her everywhere with him.

1257
01:28:51,243 --> 01:28:54,329
Then he’ll get tired of
her, and she’ll feel lost

1258
01:28:54,454 --> 01:28:56,248
and all alone in London.

1259
01:28:56,414 --> 01:28:58,875
She’ll be back in two weeks.

1260
01:28:59,000 --> 01:29:00,544
Think so?

1261
01:29:00,752 --> 01:29:04,756
Even so, it’s all over now.
No, thanks. I’d rather suffer.

1262
01:29:06,216 --> 01:29:08,051
You see...

1263
01:29:08,176 --> 01:29:10,220
I’ve made a terrible discovery.

1264
01:29:10,345 --> 01:29:13,557
You can be desperately in love

1265
01:29:13,682 --> 01:29:15,642
with someone you despise,

1266
01:29:15,767 --> 01:29:19,187
whose every gesture, word,
and thought you detest.

1267
01:29:19,312 --> 01:29:22,232
What right do you have
to despise her like that?

1268
01:29:22,357 --> 01:29:24,109
Perhaps you made a mistake,

1269
01:29:24,234 --> 01:29:27,529
but never be ashamed of having loved.

1270
01:29:27,654 --> 01:29:30,615
By despising Liliane you’re merely

1271
01:29:30,740 --> 01:29:32,409
debasing yourself.

1272
01:29:32,742 --> 01:29:34,578
Maybe you’re right.

1273
01:29:34,870 --> 01:29:38,498
Anyway, my love affairs
have always been disasters.

1274
01:29:38,874 --> 01:29:40,792
I believed women were magic.

1275
01:29:40,917 --> 01:29:44,838
Of course they’re not
magic -or else men are too.

1276
01:29:45,005 --> 01:29:47,340
Everyone’s magic... or no one is.

1277
01:29:48,800 --> 01:29:52,888
I’m sure Ferrand is wrong. Life
is more important than movies.

1278
01:29:53,013 --> 01:29:55,307
I have to go. Thanks for everything.

1279
01:29:55,473 --> 01:29:57,392
Don’t be a fool.

1280
01:29:57,517 --> 01:30:00,437
You’re going to stay
and finish your work.

1281
01:30:17,078 --> 01:30:20,040
Lucien! Is that clock working?

1282
01:30:20,624 --> 01:30:23,793
It’s 6:00 a.m. Time to make coffee!

1283
01:30:42,437 --> 01:30:44,522
Have you seen Julie?

1284
01:30:44,689 --> 01:30:46,608
No. I’m looking for Lajoie.

1285
01:30:46,775 --> 01:30:48,443
Know what that idiot did?

1286
01:30:48,610 --> 01:30:52,364
He thought we’d shot the costume
party. He sent the costumes back.

1287
01:30:52,489 --> 01:30:55,742
- So you’ve been up for hours?
- All night!

1288
01:30:55,867 --> 01:30:58,286
I’ve been at the airport
getting the costumes,

1289
01:30:58,453 --> 01:31:00,455
or we couldn’t shoot today.

1290
01:31:00,622 --> 01:31:02,624
Where could Julie be?

1291
01:31:02,791 --> 01:31:06,753
- You looked in her room?
- Yes. Her bed wasn’t slept in.

1292
01:31:06,920 --> 01:31:09,798
Everyone on this movie is nuts!

1293
01:31:38,451 --> 01:31:40,704
- What time is it?
- 6:00.

1294
01:31:40,829 --> 01:31:43,081
- Where are you going?
- To work.

1295
01:31:43,915 --> 01:31:47,502
You can sleep two more
hours. I set the alarm.

1296
01:31:48,670 --> 01:31:49,879
Stay with me.

1297
01:31:50,088 --> 01:31:51,589
can’t.

1298
01:31:52,716 --> 01:31:53,925
Don’t go.

1299
01:31:54,050 --> 01:31:57,470
I have a makeup call for
the costume party scene.

1300
01:31:57,721 --> 01:31:59,305
Wait.

1301
01:32:00,015 --> 01:32:01,474
Kiss me.

1302
01:32:05,437 --> 01:32:06,896
Don’t forget:

1303
01:32:07,063 --> 01:32:10,358
We’re going away together
when the film’s done.

1304
01:32:11,443 --> 01:32:13,028
Sleep.

1305
01:33:03,745 --> 01:33:06,539
Dr. Nelson? This is Alphonse.

1306
01:33:08,583 --> 01:33:10,251
I have something to tell you.

1307
01:33:10,418 --> 01:33:14,422
I love your wife. I slept
with her. Set her free.

1308
01:33:19,094 --> 01:33:22,388
Julie Baker is wanted on the set.

1309
01:33:26,643 --> 01:33:28,311
Just a minute.

1310
01:33:29,813 --> 01:33:31,272
Julie, call for you.

1311
01:33:31,439 --> 01:33:33,274
I think it’s your husband.

1312
01:33:33,441 --> 01:33:35,109
I’m coming.

1313
01:33:57,090 --> 01:33:59,342
- You owe me for this.
- Not now!

1314
01:33:59,467 --> 01:34:01,594
Later you’ll say it’s too late!

1315
01:34:01,719 --> 01:34:04,764
You looked everywhere?
He’s not in his room?

1316
01:34:06,474 --> 01:34:09,811
Gentlemen, Alphonse has disappeared.

1317
01:34:10,770 --> 01:34:13,106
Could he have gone back to Paris?

1318
01:34:13,231 --> 01:34:16,109
There are flights at 8:50 and 10:10.

1319
01:34:16,276 --> 01:34:17,819
Call the airport.

1320
01:34:18,027 --> 01:34:20,405
You call. I’ll rush there.

1321
01:34:20,530 --> 01:34:23,158
If he’s there, I’ll bring him back.

1322
01:34:26,578 --> 01:34:29,539
- We’ve got trouble!
- I know. Alphonse is gone.

1323
01:34:29,747 --> 01:34:32,292
I mean Julie. It’s probably nerves.

1324
01:34:32,458 --> 01:34:35,336
She’s locked herself
in and won’t see anyone.

1325
01:34:35,503 --> 01:34:37,130
You can hear her crying.

1326
01:34:37,881 --> 01:34:40,175
I hope it’s not a relapse.

1327
01:34:40,341 --> 01:34:42,177
We’ll soon find out.

1328
01:34:42,385 --> 01:34:44,053
There’s Odile.

1329
01:34:44,220 --> 01:34:47,724
She got a call. I
think it was Dr. Nelson.

1330
01:34:47,891 --> 01:34:51,019
Then she asked me to
leave and locked the door.

1331
01:34:51,186 --> 01:34:52,687
It’s me. Open the door!

1332
01:34:52,854 --> 01:34:55,315
Open up. We’re your friends!

1333
01:34:55,523 --> 01:34:57,525
It’s Bertrand. I want to help you.

1334
01:34:57,692 --> 01:34:59,068
Quiet.

1335
01:34:59,527 --> 01:35:01,571
You don’t think she’d...?

1336
01:35:01,696 --> 01:35:03,615
Well?

1337
01:35:04,073 --> 01:35:07,285
Will she talk to you?
- She won’t open the door.

1338
01:35:07,452 --> 01:35:09,704
You can hear her crying.

1339
01:35:18,546 --> 01:35:22,342
That’s too much! She keeps
us out but lets her in!

1340
01:35:22,508 --> 01:35:25,845
Perhaps she feels an expectant
mother would understand.

1341
01:35:25,970 --> 01:35:30,016
We can’t find Alphonse. We
tried the airport and hotel.

1342
01:35:30,141 --> 01:35:32,560
Julie didn’t sleep in her room.

1343
01:35:32,727 --> 01:35:36,064
Alphonse disappears. Dr.
Nelson calls long-distance.

1344
01:35:36,230 --> 01:35:38,191
The picture’s pretty clear.

1345
01:35:39,025 --> 01:35:41,694
What is this movie business of yours?

1346
01:35:41,861 --> 01:35:44,572
Where everyone’s so chummy
and sleeps with everyone else

1347
01:35:44,697 --> 01:35:45,698
and lies!

1348
01:35:45,823 --> 01:35:48,117
You think that’s normal?

1349
01:35:48,243 --> 01:35:50,036
Your precious cinema!

1350
01:35:50,161 --> 01:35:51,829
think it stinks!

1351
01:35:51,955 --> 01:35:53,581
I despise it!

1352
01:35:53,706 --> 01:35:56,584
Lajoie, get your wife out of here!

1353
01:36:02,924 --> 01:36:04,634
That woman’s wrong.

1354
01:36:04,801 --> 01:36:07,553
Movie people may be
more obvious about it,

1355
01:36:07,679 --> 01:36:10,139
but love makes the world go round.

1356
01:36:10,264 --> 01:36:13,559
- Did you talk to her?
- She wants tub butter.

1357
01:36:13,685 --> 01:36:16,104
Country butter, in a block.

1358
01:36:16,271 --> 01:36:18,481
Is she crazy? What’s she doing?

1359
01:36:18,648 --> 01:36:20,233
She’s crying.

1360
01:36:20,358 --> 01:36:23,736
She’ll stop, but we have
to find some tub butter.

1361
01:36:23,861 --> 01:36:27,031
Bernard, go find some tub butter.

1362
01:36:27,156 --> 01:36:30,076
No way! That’s not in the script!

1363
01:36:30,284 --> 01:36:32,286
You’re not being very understanding.

1364
01:36:32,453 --> 01:36:34,205
Aren’t we one big family?

1365
01:36:34,414 --> 01:36:37,000
So were those patricidal
folks in Greek tragedies.

1366
01:36:37,125 --> 01:36:39,877
Fine! I’ll find some tub better myself.

1367
01:36:41,421 --> 01:36:43,965
For all his moaning, he’s quite lucky.

1368
01:36:44,132 --> 01:36:46,926
I’ve known far more costly whims.

1369
01:36:47,218 --> 01:36:50,555
There was an Austrian
actress, Hedy Lamarr,

1370
01:36:50,805 --> 01:36:52,932
who became a Hollywood glamour queen.

1371
01:36:53,307 --> 01:36:58,104
She missed the rainy climate
of her native Tyrol so much

1372
01:36:58,479 --> 01:37:02,150
that she installed, in
her garden in California,

1373
01:37:02,483 --> 01:37:05,194
a rain-making machine.

1374
01:37:05,486 --> 01:37:08,990
So a little thing like tub butter...

1375
01:37:09,198 --> 01:37:13,036
Joelle, come help me.
This is all I could find.

1376
01:37:13,161 --> 01:37:14,787
But this isn’t -

1377
01:37:14,912 --> 01:37:17,457
There’s no tub butter
on the whole Riviera!

1378
01:37:17,665 --> 01:37:20,376
We’ll knead these sticks into one block

1379
01:37:20,543 --> 01:37:24,881
and wrap it in gauze to
make it look like tub butter.

1380
01:37:25,339 --> 01:37:28,801
Think it’ll work? It has
to. What a profession!

1381
01:37:32,346 --> 01:37:34,390
I found Alphonse.

1382
01:37:34,515 --> 01:37:38,019
You’d never guess where.
I’m bringing him back.

1383
01:37:50,698 --> 01:37:52,408
There you are!

1384
01:37:52,533 --> 01:37:56,537
Here’s Julie’s “tub butter”
- but I’m not taking it to her.

1385
01:37:56,662 --> 01:37:59,373
No! Like the old cook
in Rules of the Game,

1386
01:37:59,540 --> 01:38:02,293
“I indulge diets but
not whims.” Ferrand.

1387
01:38:03,211 --> 01:38:04,796
Very well.

1388
01:38:10,676 --> 01:38:12,178
Come in.

1389
01:38:17,558 --> 01:38:20,853
Julie, here’s what you asked for.

1390
01:38:21,938 --> 01:38:24,065
You didn’t!

1391
01:38:25,233 --> 01:38:27,318
I can’t believe it. I’m so sorry.

1392
01:38:27,902 --> 01:38:29,904
I’m so ashamed.

1393
01:38:30,405 --> 01:38:33,241
I’ll be all right.
Just give me a minute.

1394
01:38:33,741 --> 01:38:36,327
I know it’s not very professional.

1395
01:38:36,452 --> 01:38:38,287
I don’t like being like this.

1396
01:38:38,412 --> 01:38:41,040
Everyone’s waiting. I’ve
never done this before.

1397
01:38:41,165 --> 01:38:44,001
It’s all right. We can wait awhile.

1398
01:38:44,127 --> 01:38:46,212
We’ll change the schedule.

1399
01:38:46,379 --> 01:38:49,882
No, don’t change it because of me.

1400
01:38:50,883 --> 01:38:53,427
I’ll be all right in a minute.

1401
01:38:56,389 --> 01:38:58,891
Could you lend me a handkerchief?

1402
01:39:00,560 --> 01:39:02,353
I must look awful.

1403
01:39:05,898 --> 01:39:09,902
Why did Alphonse do it? He
completely misunderstood!

1404
01:39:10,027 --> 01:39:12,446
He acted like the child he is.

1405
01:39:12,613 --> 01:39:14,740
I saw enough of your husband

1406
01:39:14,907 --> 01:39:17,952
to know he’s a wonderful man.

1407
01:39:18,119 --> 01:39:19,787
Yes, he is...

1408
01:39:20,121 --> 01:39:22,290
but you don’t know the whole story.

1409
01:39:24,750 --> 01:39:27,211
When I had my breakdown,

1410
01:39:27,461 --> 01:39:29,839
he did a very serious thing.

1411
01:39:29,964 --> 01:39:32,467
He left his wife and children.

1412
01:39:33,384 --> 01:39:37,847
He left his wife and the life
he’d spent 20 years creating.

1413
01:39:38,097 --> 01:39:39,515
He did that for me.

1414
01:39:39,640 --> 01:39:42,185
He devoted himself to me

1415
01:39:42,393 --> 01:39:45,730
and tried to turn me
into a responsible woman.

1416
01:39:45,938 --> 01:39:50,902
Now he must think it
was all an awful waste!

1417
01:39:51,027 --> 01:39:55,448
No, when he finds out exactly
what happened, he’ll understand.

1418
01:39:55,573 --> 01:39:58,242
He’ll forget, and all
will be like before.

1419
01:39:58,367 --> 01:39:59,368
You think so?

1420
01:39:59,493 --> 01:40:03,331
Even if that’s true, I’ll
never be able to forget.

1421
01:40:03,873 --> 01:40:05,374
Thanks to him,

1422
01:40:05,499 --> 01:40:07,460
I know I can change my life.

1423
01:40:08,377 --> 01:40:11,881
I’ve decided to live alone.

1424
01:40:12,006 --> 01:40:15,301
I’m tired of disguises.
I’m quitting movies.

1425
01:40:15,843 --> 01:40:17,970
Now I know that life is rotten.

1426
01:40:20,765 --> 01:40:24,185
Since we can’t film, let’s
record some sound effects.

1427
01:40:24,352 --> 01:40:27,313
When you’re ready.
- First, applause.

1428
01:40:33,945 --> 01:40:35,947
Now some crowd noise.

1429
01:40:36,864 --> 01:40:39,158
And don’t discuss movies.

1430
01:40:44,747 --> 01:40:47,375
Now more applause.

1431
01:40:53,256 --> 01:40:55,424
It’s Dr. Nelson!

1432
01:41:01,639 --> 01:41:05,017
Julie’s dressing room is in
the first hallway on the right.

1433
01:41:07,561 --> 01:41:09,563
No one was doing anything,

1434
01:41:09,730 --> 01:41:12,483
so I called him, and he agreed to come.

1435
01:41:28,541 --> 01:41:30,126
What is it?

1436
01:41:30,251 --> 01:41:34,255
I screwed up royally. Now
I’m about to face Julie.

1437
01:41:34,422 --> 01:41:37,174
I don’t know what to tell
her. Should I apologize?

1438
01:41:37,300 --> 01:41:40,720
Listen, Alphonse: The
less you say, the better.

1439
01:41:42,179 --> 01:41:45,599
I’ve made up my mind.
I’m quitting movies.

1440
01:41:45,766 --> 01:41:48,436
Good idea. You do that.

1441
01:41:49,687 --> 01:41:51,480
There. All ready.

1442
01:41:54,108 --> 01:41:56,277
Are you going to see Julie now?

1443
01:41:56,444 --> 01:41:59,905
Tell her this is the new
dialogue for the scene.

1444
01:42:00,031 --> 01:42:02,116
Ask her to learn it.

1445
01:42:39,320 --> 01:42:42,448
May I touch up your makeup now?

1446
01:42:42,615 --> 01:42:44,492
Of course, Odije.

1447
01:42:45,284 --> 01:42:47,703
I’m fine now.

1448
01:42:47,995 --> 01:42:50,164
Let’s make ourselves beautiful.

1449
01:42:55,669 --> 01:42:57,922
Mr. Ferrand sent this up.

1450
01:42:58,047 --> 01:43:00,591
It’s your new dialogue for the scene.

1451
01:43:03,928 --> 01:43:08,182
“Even if that’s true, I’ll
never be able to forget.

1452
01:43:08,682 --> 01:43:11,268
I’ve decided to live alone.

1453
01:43:11,394 --> 01:43:13,687
Now I know that life is rotten.”

1454
01:43:13,854 --> 01:43:16,190
That man will use anything!

1455
01:43:18,150 --> 01:43:19,652
Ready, Julie?

1456
01:43:19,777 --> 01:43:21,278
Begin.

1457
01:43:23,197 --> 01:43:26,200
I’ve decided to live alone.

1458
01:43:26,742 --> 01:43:28,703
Now I know that life is rotten.

1459
01:43:28,869 --> 01:43:31,664
No, life isn’t rotten.

1460
01:44:08,200 --> 01:44:10,703
Cut. Once more for the hands.

1461
01:44:10,828 --> 01:44:13,539
- Was the candle okay?
- Fine.

1462
01:44:13,664 --> 01:44:17,752
- Starting places.
- Places, quickly and quietly.

1463
01:44:21,088 --> 01:44:24,216
I’ll stroke your cheek
with this hand instead.

1464
01:44:24,800 --> 01:44:26,635
Places.

1465
01:44:27,970 --> 01:44:29,763
Let’s go right into it.

1466
01:44:30,097 --> 01:44:31,599
Roll camera.

1467
01:44:39,899 --> 01:44:42,776
I’ve decided to live alone.

1468
01:44:43,277 --> 01:44:45,446
Now I know that life is rotten.

1469
01:44:45,613 --> 01:44:48,574
No, life isn’t rotten.

1470
01:45:26,987 --> 01:45:29,490
Cut. That was the best one!

1471
01:45:29,615 --> 01:45:31,492
Alexandre’s been killed!

1472
01:45:32,743 --> 01:45:36,080
In a car accident, coming
back from the airport.

1473
01:45:36,205 --> 01:45:39,208
He’d gone to pick up Christian.

1474
01:45:39,333 --> 01:45:41,627
A truck hit their car.

1475
01:45:42,211 --> 01:45:45,756
Christian is badly
hurt, but he’ll recover.

1476
01:45:46,674 --> 01:45:48,425
Alexandre died...

1477
01:45:49,093 --> 01:45:51,345
on the way to the hospital.

1478
01:45:54,515 --> 01:45:58,352
Alexandre was buried this morning
in a little cemetery above Nice.

1479
01:45:58,477 --> 01:46:00,938
We’re waiting for the English
insurance representative.

1480
01:46:01,063 --> 01:46:03,232
The film’s fate is in his hands.

1481
01:46:03,357 --> 01:46:06,235
What I’ve always dreaded has happened:

1482
01:46:06,360 --> 01:46:09,113
a production halted by an actor’s death.

1483
01:46:10,739 --> 01:46:13,701
The era of studio films
died with Alexandre.

1484
01:46:13,868 --> 01:46:18,038
Films will be shot in the
streets, without stars or scripts.

1485
01:46:18,205 --> 01:46:21,166
There will be no more
films like Meet Pamela.

1486
01:46:37,349 --> 01:46:39,935
Come have breakfast with us.

1487
01:46:40,060 --> 01:46:41,645
Alphonse is still asleep.

1488
01:46:41,770 --> 01:46:43,647
No, “in bed.”

1489
01:46:43,898 --> 01:46:46,400
- We’re invited over.
- Tell them okay.

1490
01:46:46,609 --> 01:46:48,360
We’ll be right there.

1491
01:46:48,527 --> 01:46:50,779
- Was that good?
- Fine. Cut.

1492
01:46:51,196 --> 01:46:53,699
Wait for me! I’m coming over!

1493
01:46:58,203 --> 01:47:00,998
I was afraid he might
get in an accident.

1494
01:47:01,165 --> 01:47:03,751
That’s why I offered him a driver.

1495
01:47:04,251 --> 01:47:08,005
That man was never at home anywhere.

1496
01:47:08,714 --> 01:47:10,758
Always rushing off somewhere.

1497
01:47:10,925 --> 01:47:13,052
A man in a hurry.

1498
01:47:13,385 --> 01:47:15,929
I disagree. He was at home everywhere.

1499
01:47:16,055 --> 01:47:18,265
He liked people. He
lived for the moment.

1500
01:47:18,432 --> 01:47:20,601
He couldn’t tear himself away.

1501
01:47:20,768 --> 01:47:23,771
He was rushing back
so as not to be late.

1502
01:47:23,938 --> 01:47:27,107
You could say his own
thoughtfulness killed him.

1503
01:47:27,232 --> 01:47:28,901
Maybe you’re right.

1504
01:47:29,610 --> 01:47:32,112
Now we have to finish the film.

1505
01:47:33,364 --> 01:47:37,284
It’s up to the insurance company.
What does Mr. Johanssen say?

1506
01:47:52,633 --> 01:47:56,303
Mr. Johanssen spoke at
length with London last night.

1507
01:47:56,470 --> 01:47:59,765
They will not allow you to
reshoot Alexandre’s scenes

1508
01:47:59,890 --> 01:48:01,475
with another actor.

1509
01:48:01,642 --> 01:48:04,269
The only solution is
to simplify the plot

1510
01:48:04,395 --> 01:48:07,898
and finish in five days
instead of two weeks.

1511
01:48:08,148 --> 01:48:10,693
Then the insurance
will cover everything.

1512
01:48:10,818 --> 01:48:12,403
Five days.

1513
01:48:12,528 --> 01:48:14,780
We’ll have to simplify things.

1514
01:48:14,905 --> 01:48:19,618
We’ll leave Alexandre out
of the costume party scene.

1515
01:48:19,743 --> 01:48:22,538
Then the candle scene
with Julie and Alphonse

1516
01:48:22,663 --> 01:48:24,665
makes no sense.

1517
01:48:24,832 --> 01:48:27,251
Then we’ll cut the costume party.

1518
01:48:27,376 --> 01:48:29,628
The story works without it.

1519
01:48:29,837 --> 01:48:32,339
Then the only important scene left

1520
01:48:32,464 --> 01:48:34,967
is when Alphonse shoots his father.

1521
01:48:35,092 --> 01:48:37,845
We can film it from a distance

1522
01:48:38,011 --> 01:48:40,389
and find a stand-in for Alexandre.

1523
01:48:40,514 --> 01:48:44,852
But it’ll still be obvious, unless
Alphonse shoots him in the back.

1524
01:48:45,019 --> 01:48:47,730
That’s it! He’ll shoot him in the back!

1525
01:48:47,855 --> 01:48:49,940
Much better. Much more powerful.

1526
01:48:50,065 --> 01:48:53,569
Why not have it all
take place in the snow?

1527
01:49:25,392 --> 01:49:26,727
Walter, let’s go.

1528
01:49:26,894 --> 01:49:28,896
Just like last time.

1529
01:49:29,229 --> 01:49:32,357
Yes, but much tighter on Alphonse.

1530
01:49:32,483 --> 01:49:36,278
Of course. But we have to
see the gun at some point.

1531
01:49:36,403 --> 01:49:38,614
Here’s the stand-in.

1532
01:49:38,739 --> 01:49:41,784
Ah, hello. He’ll do, right?

1533
01:49:41,909 --> 01:49:45,329
Would you take a few
steps to give us an idea?

1534
01:49:45,454 --> 01:49:49,041
- His hair’s too long.
- It has to work.

1535
01:49:49,166 --> 01:49:51,627
Odile, that’s Alexandre’s stand-in.

1536
01:49:51,794 --> 01:49:55,297
Trim his hair more like Alexandre’s.

1537
01:49:55,923 --> 01:49:59,885
This is the gun you
wanted for Alphonse, right?

1538
01:50:00,052 --> 01:50:02,471
If that’s the one I chose.

1539
01:50:04,264 --> 01:50:08,560
Places, everybody. Quickly.

1540
01:50:09,895 --> 01:50:11,438
Quickly, please!

1541
01:50:11,563 --> 01:50:14,149
The places I indicated earlier.

1542
01:50:16,276 --> 01:50:19,780
I don’t want the snow
too white or too clean.

1543
01:50:19,947 --> 01:50:23,575
Don’t worry. I’ll make it
like in Stain on the Snow.

1544
01:50:23,700 --> 01:50:25,285
Great.

1545
01:50:26,453 --> 01:50:30,749
I’ve got an offer for a film in
Tokyo. I’m tempted to take it.

1546
01:50:30,874 --> 01:50:33,627
Turgenev’s First Love.
It’s a good story.

1547
01:50:33,794 --> 01:50:35,379
Think it could work?

1548
01:50:35,546 --> 01:50:39,132
Sure, with a Japanese girl
and you as the Frenchman.

1549
01:50:39,258 --> 01:50:43,470
I’ll do it because it’s Tokyo,
13,000 miles from my problems.

1550
01:50:43,595 --> 01:50:46,515
Listen, should I hold
the gun like this...

1551
01:50:46,640 --> 01:50:48,225
or like that?

1552
01:50:48,350 --> 01:50:51,228
Like that, so it stands
out against the snow.

1553
01:50:51,353 --> 01:50:54,523
Dr. Nelson and Julie
want to say good-bye.

1554
01:50:54,648 --> 01:50:58,318
- Are they off to London?
- Australia. A medical conference.

1555
01:50:58,485 --> 01:51:01,405
Be ready to shoot when I get back.

1556
01:51:07,244 --> 01:51:10,998
See you in Paris soon
for the post-synch.

1557
01:51:18,297 --> 01:51:20,841
Let’s start before it gets dark.

1558
01:51:36,064 --> 01:51:36,982
Good luck.

1559
01:51:37,149 --> 01:51:38,150
You too.

1560
01:51:47,951 --> 01:51:49,703
Action!

1561
01:52:04,051 --> 01:52:05,886
Be more discreet.

1562
01:52:10,724 --> 01:52:12,559
Walk faster.

1563
01:52:17,064 --> 01:52:18,732
Now the gun.

1564
01:52:21,151 --> 01:52:22,819
Now run.

1565
01:52:24,071 --> 01:52:26,239
Run off into the square.

1566
01:52:53,725 --> 01:52:54,726
Cut!

1567
01:52:55,602 --> 01:52:58,146
We’re all done. Thanks, everyone.

1568
01:53:11,410 --> 01:53:13,036
Going back to Paris?

1569
01:53:13,245 --> 01:53:15,789
No, I’m staying around here for a rest.

1570
01:53:15,956 --> 01:53:18,041
Have a nice rest.

1571
01:53:18,667 --> 01:53:21,628
Listen, my car was wrecked in the stunt.

1572
01:53:21,795 --> 01:53:25,590
I’ve got another one in
Paris, but I need a ride.

1573
01:53:25,799 --> 01:53:29,261
With me? Impossible!
It’s full of my gear,

1574
01:53:29,386 --> 01:53:32,639
and I like to be independent.
- No problem.

1575
01:53:32,806 --> 01:53:35,309
Yann, wait for me!

1576
01:53:36,268 --> 01:53:39,563
See you at unemployment.
We can sign up together!

1577
01:53:40,731 --> 01:53:42,441
You’re going back on that?

1578
01:53:42,566 --> 01:53:44,818
I’m taking Odile to meet my folks.

1579
01:53:44,985 --> 01:53:46,653
We’re getting married.

1580
01:53:46,820 --> 01:53:50,949
You certainly hid it well!
I’m sure no one suspected.

1581
01:53:51,074 --> 01:53:54,661
She’s experienced and
I’m not. It averages out.

1582
01:53:54,995 --> 01:53:57,539
All the best. Congratulations.

1583
01:53:58,749 --> 01:54:00,792
Bye, Walter.

1584
01:54:00,917 --> 01:54:03,337
And thanks. Great camera work.

1585
01:54:03,503 --> 01:54:04,713
I’m happy you’re happy.

1586
01:54:04,838 --> 01:54:07,090
Bye, kids! Have a nice trip!

1587
01:54:08,341 --> 01:54:11,011
Drive carefully!

1588
01:54:11,136 --> 01:54:13,847
Could you say a few
words about Alexandre?

1589
01:54:14,014 --> 01:54:17,684
No, it’s too personal.
Ask Bertrand, the producer.

1590
01:54:17,809 --> 01:54:19,144
He refused.

1591
01:54:19,269 --> 01:54:21,521
- Alphonse?
- He won’t talk about death.

1592
01:54:21,688 --> 01:54:23,273
Sorry.

1593
01:54:23,398 --> 01:54:25,817
I’ll talk to you!

1594
01:54:27,986 --> 01:54:30,030
Is he in the frame?

1595
01:54:30,155 --> 01:54:32,532
- Who is this guy?
- Propman, I think.

1596
01:54:32,699 --> 01:54:36,036
Tell me: Wasn’t this
a hard film to make?

1597
01:54:36,203 --> 01:54:38,872
I heard there were some rocky moments.

1598
01:54:38,997 --> 01:54:41,124
Not at all. It went fine!

1599
01:54:41,291 --> 01:54:44,169
And we hope audiences enjoy watching it

1600
01:54:44,294 --> 01:54:46,338
as much as we enjoyed making it.
