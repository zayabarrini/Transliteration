1
00:02:15,128 --> 00:02:17,968
Okay, a little more.

2
00:02:19,848 --> 00:02:21,528
You had some more space.

3
00:02:22,528 --> 00:02:24,168
How could you park like that?

4
00:02:24,608 --> 00:02:26,888
Its all right.
I'll be out in a jiffy anyway.

5
00:02:27,288 --> 00:02:28,488
This way.

6
00:03:25,728 --> 00:03:27,288
Sir, so is that your car?

7
00:03:48,448 --> 00:03:50,888
You bitch,
you're dead if I catch you.

8
00:03:51,048 --> 00:03:54,328
"The Chaser"

9
00:04:33,128 --> 00:04:34,208
Yes.

10
00:04:34,928 --> 00:04:36,328
Yes.

11
00:04:37,328 --> 00:04:38,528
I'm back!

12
00:04:40,208 --> 00:04:41,408
I'm sorry, sir.

13
00:04:44,248 --> 00:04:47,768
2 of our girls ran away.
Business has been bad lately.

14
00:04:48,368 --> 00:04:52,088
I've already put such a
big advance on those girls.

15
00:04:53,848 --> 00:04:58,808
But sir, I can't get that much
money ready in 3 days.

16
00:04:58,928 --> 00:05:02,528
Once I collect the money from them,
and pay you back...

17
00:05:09,088 --> 00:05:09,808
Turn it off, asshole!

18
00:05:09,928 --> 00:05:12,488
Can't you see I was on the phone?

19
00:05:15,528 --> 00:05:18,168
You have no fucking manners.

20
00:05:18,968 --> 00:05:19,968
Did you hand them out?

21
00:05:20,328 --> 00:05:22,208
- Yes, sir.
- Go hand out some more, idiot!

22
00:05:25,488 --> 00:05:27,768
Dumb asshole.

23
00:05:36,408 --> 00:05:37,528
Yes.

24
00:05:38,608 --> 00:05:39,808
Where?

25
00:05:40,648 --> 00:05:42,048
Hapjung district.

26
00:05:42,568 --> 00:05:45,688
Provence Motel, room 301.

27
00:05:46,488 --> 00:05:47,808
I'll send her now.

28
00:05:56,968 --> 00:05:58,448
- Hello.
- Hey.

29
00:05:58,968 --> 00:06:00,088
You came fast.

30
00:06:09,408 --> 00:06:11,968
Seong-hee, you don't look so young.

31
00:06:12,088 --> 00:06:14,448
- How old are you?
- 30.

32
00:06:15,048 --> 00:06:18,088
You took good care of yourself.
Nice body.

33
00:06:20,248 --> 00:06:21,848
Why? Need to go pee?

34
00:06:22,368 --> 00:06:24,048
- Yes.
- Later.

35
00:06:24,168 --> 00:06:26,848
- No.
- Go later.

36
00:06:29,848 --> 00:06:32,128
I told you to go later.

37
00:06:41,128 --> 00:06:43,128
- What's wrong?
- Let go.

38
00:06:43,248 --> 00:06:45,888
- Just wanted to take some pictures.
- Let go!

39
00:06:46,328 --> 00:06:48,408
Okay, I'll pay you instead.

40
00:06:48,528 --> 00:06:50,408
Let go, you pervert!

41
00:06:52,168 --> 00:06:53,208
What?

42
00:06:53,328 --> 00:06:55,128
Crazy assholes.

43
00:07:00,928 --> 00:07:01,728
Where is she?

44
00:07:04,848 --> 00:07:06,848
You fucking slut!

45
00:07:06,968 --> 00:07:10,008
You call me a pervert, huh?

46
00:07:10,128 --> 00:07:13,328
Watch your mouth, bitch!

47
00:07:13,448 --> 00:07:16,128
You want to die?

48
00:07:16,448 --> 00:07:18,408
Come here, you bitch!

49
00:07:18,568 --> 00:07:21,088
- Mister.
- You're dead!

50
00:07:21,248 --> 00:07:24,568
She's leaving. Calm down.

51
00:07:24,688 --> 00:07:26,768
- Get out!
- Come here, bitch!

52
00:07:26,888 --> 00:07:28,128
- Mister.
- Come over here!

53
00:07:28,248 --> 00:07:29,928
- She's leaving.
- Bitch...

54
00:07:30,088 --> 00:07:33,688
Come here, you bitch!
You're dead!

55
00:07:33,808 --> 00:07:36,168
- She's leaving now.
- You bitch!

56
00:07:36,328 --> 00:07:38,568
- Calm down...
- What the fuck...

57
00:07:41,128 --> 00:07:42,408
Who the hell are you?

58
00:07:42,568 --> 00:07:44,208
I'm her guardian, asshole.

59
00:07:55,848 --> 00:07:57,288
Sit down.

60
00:07:58,648 --> 00:08:00,328
Kneel down.

61
00:08:05,568 --> 00:08:07,368
Cover yourself!

62
00:08:25,888 --> 00:08:27,368
So what are you going to do?

63
00:08:29,928 --> 00:08:31,328
Let's settle this.

64
00:08:48,328 --> 00:08:49,528
Satisfied?

65
00:08:55,528 --> 00:08:58,168
There you are.

66
00:08:58,288 --> 00:08:59,408
Let me see.

67
00:09:02,248 --> 00:09:05,248
I'm quitting for real.
Don't call me.

68
00:09:07,048 --> 00:09:07,968
Hey!

69
00:09:10,008 --> 00:09:10,928
Hey!

70
00:09:15,688 --> 00:09:17,088
Did you find the girls?

71
00:09:20,728 --> 00:09:22,048
Where did you find the car?

72
00:09:22,648 --> 00:09:23,648
In Mangwon district.

73
00:09:23,808 --> 00:09:25,008
Did you call the police?

74
00:09:25,128 --> 00:09:26,368
You crazy?

75
00:09:26,488 --> 00:09:28,088
Report girls who
ran away from me?

76
00:09:28,208 --> 00:09:30,368
I told you they didn't run away.

77
00:09:31,088 --> 00:09:33,168
You used to be a detective.

78
00:09:33,288 --> 00:09:35,968
Then go find them
instead of ripping people off.

79
00:09:36,088 --> 00:09:38,448
You crazy bitch,
who says I'm ripping people off?

80
00:09:38,968 --> 00:09:41,328
I'm the one
who's being ripped off.

81
00:09:42,728 --> 00:09:45,448
Bitches get a big advance from me
and then disappear.

82
00:09:45,608 --> 00:09:47,848
Ask any asshole on the street
what it means.

83
00:09:48,368 --> 00:09:50,528
Whether they've been sold
or ran away.

84
00:09:53,928 --> 00:09:55,488
Rotten bastard.

85
00:09:55,648 --> 00:09:56,968
Hey!

86
00:09:57,088 --> 00:10:00,608
Hey! Seong-hee!

87
00:10:01,128 --> 00:10:03,848
That damn temper of hers.

88
00:10:09,848 --> 00:10:11,328
Meathead

89
00:10:13,288 --> 00:10:14,328
What?

90
00:10:14,448 --> 00:10:19,328
This bastard keeps rejecting the girls
and now there's no one left.

91
00:10:19,448 --> 00:10:20,768
There's Mi-jin, idiot.

92
00:10:21,288 --> 00:10:23,328
She wants to rest
because she's caught a cold.

93
00:10:23,448 --> 00:10:26,368
Cold my ass. I'm hanging up.

94
00:10:27,208 --> 00:10:29,648
What the fuck's wrong
with everyone?

95
00:10:48,488 --> 00:10:49,448
Mom.

96
00:10:52,328 --> 00:10:53,848
Mom!

97
00:10:56,248 --> 00:10:57,168
What?

98
00:10:57,288 --> 00:10:58,408
Take the medicine.

99
00:11:20,808 --> 00:11:22,528
Bring me my cell phone, honey.

100
00:11:28,008 --> 00:11:29,408
Filth

101
00:11:42,488 --> 00:11:43,408
Yes, Jung-ho.

102
00:11:43,528 --> 00:11:44,768
Where are you?

103
00:11:45,288 --> 00:11:48,208
I'm sorry. I'm very sick.

104
00:11:48,328 --> 00:11:49,768
Where are you sick?

105
00:11:49,888 --> 00:11:51,648
I think it's a cold.
I also have a fever.

106
00:11:52,848 --> 00:11:54,648
I'll take a day off.

107
00:11:54,768 --> 00:11:55,888
A cold?

108
00:11:56,008 --> 00:11:57,728
In the middle of summer?

109
00:11:59,168 --> 00:12:00,168
Are you with a guy?

110
00:12:00,688 --> 00:12:01,888
No.

111
00:12:02,048 --> 00:12:03,928
Are you trying to run away
like the others?

112
00:12:04,328 --> 00:12:05,928
What are you saying?

113
00:12:06,568 --> 00:12:10,848
You better get to work
before you regret it.

114
00:12:12,008 --> 00:12:12,968
Okay?

115
00:12:14,128 --> 00:12:15,328
Why aren't you answering me?

116
00:12:16,328 --> 00:12:17,568
Jung-ho, please.

117
00:12:17,688 --> 00:12:20,928
Where do you live?
I'm going over right now.

118
00:12:23,048 --> 00:12:24,768
Where is it?

119
00:12:26,608 --> 00:12:28,488
Okay, I'll go.

120
00:12:28,648 --> 00:12:30,128
Call Meathead.

121
00:12:30,568 --> 00:12:31,528
Yes.

122
00:12:37,808 --> 00:12:39,008
Damn it.

123
00:12:42,048 --> 00:12:43,048
What's this?

124
00:12:51,528 --> 00:12:52,968
You have to go?

125
00:12:55,088 --> 00:12:56,768
I'll be back soon.

126
00:13:02,928 --> 00:13:04,248
Yes, a Matiz.

127
00:13:05,448 --> 00:13:08,928
I'm wearing a white cardigan
over a dress.

128
00:13:32,128 --> 00:13:33,328
Did it turn on?

129
00:13:33,448 --> 00:13:34,528
Yes.

130
00:13:45,448 --> 00:13:46,728
4885?

131
00:13:48,808 --> 00:13:50,008
4885...

132
00:13:51,968 --> 00:13:53,368
I've heard of it.

133
00:13:54,568 --> 00:13:56,048
4885?

134
00:13:56,168 --> 00:13:57,008
Know this number?

135
00:13:57,128 --> 00:13:58,368
Yes, sir.

136
00:13:58,488 --> 00:14:00,368
He's a complete wacko.

137
00:14:01,088 --> 00:14:03,448
Mi-jin went to serve
that bastard.

138
00:14:03,848 --> 00:14:05,088
Ji-young

139
00:14:10,648 --> 00:14:12,248
Mi-jin

140
00:14:13,248 --> 00:14:14,568
Shit.

141
00:14:18,048 --> 00:14:18,968
Where did she go?

142
00:14:19,088 --> 00:14:19,928
To Mangwon district.

143
00:14:20,048 --> 00:14:23,368
Yeah, it's that bastard.
He sold them.

144
00:14:23,528 --> 00:14:25,568
It's me.
Just answer yes or no.

145
00:14:25,728 --> 00:14:27,408
Are you with
that bastard now?

146
00:14:27,528 --> 00:14:28,848
Your customer.

147
00:14:28,968 --> 00:14:30,768
At a motel or his home?

148
00:14:30,888 --> 00:14:32,968
Are you going to his house
in your car?

149
00:14:33,128 --> 00:14:34,328
Okay, listen carefully.

150
00:14:34,448 --> 00:14:37,088
Memorize his address
as you go into his house.

151
00:14:37,248 --> 00:14:39,488
Just do as I say.

152
00:14:39,608 --> 00:14:41,208
Don't get me upset.

153
00:14:41,328 --> 00:14:44,088
Soon as you go in,
tell him you'll take a shower.

154
00:14:44,208 --> 00:14:47,448
Then text me his address.
Simple, right?

155
00:14:47,568 --> 00:14:48,408
Don't let him be suspicious.

156
00:14:48,528 --> 00:14:50,688
You die if you screw up.

157
00:14:52,768 --> 00:14:53,968
I'm finally lucky.

158
00:14:54,088 --> 00:14:55,208
Shouldn't we report it?

159
00:14:55,368 --> 00:14:57,128
Want to see
this business go down?

160
00:14:57,648 --> 00:14:59,048
Look after the office.

161
00:14:59,288 --> 00:15:00,608
Yes, sir.

162
00:15:04,848 --> 00:15:06,368
Who is it?

163
00:15:06,488 --> 00:15:08,168
My manager.

164
00:15:09,088 --> 00:15:10,528
Your boss?

165
00:15:11,648 --> 00:15:13,328
Yes.

166
00:15:15,688 --> 00:15:16,968
Something wrong?

167
00:15:17,288 --> 00:15:20,048
No, he's worried
that I'm sick.

168
00:15:21,248 --> 00:15:22,848
Which way shall I go?

169
00:15:23,368 --> 00:15:25,888
Over there.
Park in front of the guard post.

170
00:15:44,728 --> 00:15:46,608
What a tough life.

171
00:15:46,928 --> 00:15:49,208
The mayor of Seoul.

172
00:15:49,328 --> 00:15:51,608
At the market at this hour.

173
00:15:56,248 --> 00:15:57,168
Jung-ho, what's up?

174
00:15:57,288 --> 00:15:58,408
Gil-woo, are you busy?

175
00:15:58,568 --> 00:16:00,728
I'm busy, why?

176
00:16:00,848 --> 00:16:02,528
Remember what I told you?

177
00:16:02,688 --> 00:16:05,048
- What?
- About my girls running away.

178
00:16:05,168 --> 00:16:08,008
They didn't run away.
They've been sold.

179
00:16:08,168 --> 00:16:10,208
The same guy called for
the girls.

180
00:16:10,368 --> 00:16:12,808
So?
Going to catch that asshole?

181
00:16:12,968 --> 00:16:14,608
- Yes.
- Where are you?

182
00:16:14,728 --> 00:16:16,728
Mangwon district.
Are you busy now?

183
00:16:16,848 --> 00:16:19,608
I told you I'm busy.

184
00:16:19,728 --> 00:16:21,528
I don't know
how many of them there are.

185
00:16:21,648 --> 00:16:23,248
I might be outnumbered.

186
00:16:23,368 --> 00:16:25,568
Could you send
a few of your guys at least?

187
00:16:25,688 --> 00:16:27,568
History will be the judge!

188
00:16:28,488 --> 00:16:31,008
Get the hell out!

189
00:16:35,088 --> 00:16:36,968
Gil-woo?

190
00:16:37,128 --> 00:16:38,208
Damn it.

191
00:16:43,528 --> 00:16:44,648
It's here.

192
00:16:49,368 --> 00:16:50,688
Mangwon district, 24-1

193
00:17:10,208 --> 00:17:11,208
Something wrong?

194
00:17:12,128 --> 00:17:13,248
No.

195
00:17:20,168 --> 00:17:21,088
Come in.

196
00:17:22,368 --> 00:17:23,368
Okay.

197
00:18:02,368 --> 00:18:04,608
- Coming?
- Yes.

198
00:18:48,128 --> 00:18:49,608
I'll take a shower.

199
00:18:50,808 --> 00:18:52,768
Sure, it's over there.

200
00:19:09,768 --> 00:19:11,088
Mangwon district

201
00:19:13,728 --> 00:19:15,008
Sending

202
00:19:25,528 --> 00:19:26,608
Message failed

203
00:20:39,848 --> 00:20:42,968
I think I left the condom in my car.
I'll be right back.

204
00:20:46,248 --> 00:20:47,208
Okay.

205
00:21:17,248 --> 00:21:18,168
Mi-jin

206
00:21:22,048 --> 00:21:24,488
Your call cannot be connected.

207
00:21:24,648 --> 00:21:25,928
Damn it.

208
00:21:27,688 --> 00:21:28,328
Mi-jin

209
00:21:30,688 --> 00:21:31,968
- Your call cannot be connected.
- What the...

210
00:22:28,808 --> 00:22:30,208
Hey.

211
00:22:32,808 --> 00:22:33,928
Do you know Ji-young?

212
00:22:36,568 --> 00:22:38,328
Haven't seen her for a while,
have you?

213
00:22:41,528 --> 00:22:44,168
Hush, hush.

214
00:22:44,688 --> 00:22:46,768
She kept screaming,
so I cut off her tongue.

215
00:22:57,368 --> 00:22:58,768
Good.

216
00:23:00,728 --> 00:23:02,048
Mi-jin.

217
00:23:02,928 --> 00:23:04,128
Scared?

218
00:23:06,408 --> 00:23:07,888
Do you want to go home?

219
00:23:11,368 --> 00:23:12,928
Why do you
want to go home?

220
00:23:15,768 --> 00:23:17,728
Tell me why you should live.

221
00:23:21,328 --> 00:23:22,528
No reason?

222
00:23:23,648 --> 00:23:25,328
Spare me.

223
00:23:25,448 --> 00:23:26,888
Please let me live!

224
00:23:28,048 --> 00:23:29,448
No reason, right?

225
00:23:29,768 --> 00:23:32,248
Wait! I have one!

226
00:23:32,848 --> 00:23:34,528
I have a daughter.

227
00:23:35,928 --> 00:23:38,688
She's 7 years old.

228
00:23:43,688 --> 00:23:45,728
Nobody would even know
that you're dead.

229
00:23:47,408 --> 00:23:49,008
Nobody will look for you.

230
00:23:53,648 --> 00:23:55,528
Don't move.

231
00:23:55,968 --> 00:23:57,448
Don't move.

232
00:23:57,608 --> 00:23:59,768
It won't hurt at all.
None of them felt any pain.

233
00:24:01,328 --> 00:24:03,008
It hurts if you move around.

234
00:24:09,288 --> 00:24:10,608
Damn it.

235
00:24:13,248 --> 00:24:16,728
9256-4885

236
00:24:22,888 --> 00:24:24,408
Your call cannot be connected.

237
00:24:31,248 --> 00:24:33,048
Damn it.

238
00:25:20,448 --> 00:25:22,608
Damn it.

239
00:25:58,048 --> 00:25:59,328
Who is it?

240
00:26:00,328 --> 00:26:02,128
Sorry to disturb you so late.

241
00:26:02,248 --> 00:26:04,248
Is Mr. Park home?

242
00:26:04,368 --> 00:26:05,568
Who are you people?

243
00:26:05,728 --> 00:26:07,408
Please leave

244
00:26:08,208 --> 00:26:09,608
There's no one
by that name here.

245
00:26:11,088 --> 00:26:14,208
Mr. Park hasn't come
to church lately.

246
00:26:14,368 --> 00:26:15,968
There's no sign of him.

247
00:26:18,208 --> 00:26:19,808
There's no such person here.

248
00:26:21,448 --> 00:26:23,328
Then did he move?

249
00:26:23,448 --> 00:26:24,648
I don't know.

250
00:26:28,248 --> 00:26:30,408
Oh, goodness, it's Pungsan.

251
00:26:30,848 --> 00:26:32,608
- Honey, isn't that Pungsan?
- You're right.

252
00:26:32,768 --> 00:26:34,448
How'd you get so skinny?

253
00:26:34,568 --> 00:26:35,608
Let's go.

254
00:26:35,728 --> 00:26:37,128
Wait a minute. Look at her.

255
00:26:37,288 --> 00:26:38,848
Why are you being
so stubborn?

256
00:26:39,848 --> 00:26:41,928
- Pungsan!
- I'm sorry to disturb you.

257
00:26:42,088 --> 00:26:44,048
Let's go.

258
00:26:45,328 --> 00:26:46,928
Something's not right.

259
00:26:47,368 --> 00:26:49,248
Wait a minute.

260
00:26:54,128 --> 00:26:55,448
Sorry.

261
00:26:56,168 --> 00:26:58,528
Actually, he's sleeping.

262
00:27:00,848 --> 00:27:02,048
Come inside.

263
00:27:04,688 --> 00:27:07,168
- Do you live around here?
- Yes.

264
00:27:07,288 --> 00:27:11,848
Have you seen a guy and a girl
with long hair and a pale face?

265
00:27:12,008 --> 00:27:12,808
No, I haven't.

266
00:27:12,968 --> 00:27:14,248
- They were just here.
- Sorry.

267
00:27:24,568 --> 00:27:27,288
Why do you keep on
bothering me?

268
00:27:58,568 --> 00:27:59,888
Damn it.

269
00:28:15,208 --> 00:28:18,048
Fuck.

270
00:28:40,328 --> 00:28:41,608
I'm busy so just give me
your number.

271
00:28:41,768 --> 00:28:43,048
The insurance will cover it.

272
00:28:44,328 --> 00:28:47,568
I said
just give me your number.

273
00:28:48,168 --> 00:28:49,208
Forget it. Just go.

274
00:28:49,608 --> 00:28:50,648
What?

275
00:28:51,528 --> 00:28:53,328
It's all right. Just leave.

276
00:28:55,488 --> 00:28:57,928
Don't lay one on me later.
Just give me your number.

277
00:28:58,088 --> 00:28:59,088
Mister!

278
00:29:00,288 --> 00:29:02,048
I'm all right, okay?

279
00:29:12,648 --> 00:29:14,128
Sir.

280
00:29:14,568 --> 00:29:17,288
I made a mistake,
so I should make up for it.

281
00:29:17,448 --> 00:29:18,528
It's okay.

282
00:29:20,008 --> 00:29:23,928
Give me your number.
I'll take care of it, okay?

283
00:29:25,008 --> 00:29:26,328
I said it's all right.

284
00:29:30,688 --> 00:29:33,248
I'm really okay,
so can you move your car?

285
00:29:33,368 --> 00:29:34,368
You don't have to pay me.

286
00:29:34,488 --> 00:29:37,408
No, give me your number.
I'll pay for the damage.

287
00:29:39,848 --> 00:29:41,288
You're hurt.

288
00:29:41,768 --> 00:29:43,288
Isn't that blood?

289
00:29:43,888 --> 00:29:45,288
What are you talking about?

290
00:29:50,528 --> 00:29:52,608
Move your car!

291
00:29:53,128 --> 00:29:56,728
I said move your car!
Are you deaf?

292
00:29:56,848 --> 00:29:59,808
Lady, move your damn car!

293
00:29:59,928 --> 00:30:01,128
Pull out!

294
00:30:01,648 --> 00:30:03,328
- Pull out!
- Hey, 4885.

295
00:30:06,048 --> 00:30:06,968
It's you, huh?

296
00:30:11,688 --> 00:30:13,888
Oh, brother.

297
00:30:14,688 --> 00:30:15,968
Son of a bitch.

298
00:30:23,688 --> 00:30:25,008
Answer it, asshole.

299
00:30:30,408 --> 00:30:34,048
You're dead meat.

300
00:30:36,368 --> 00:30:37,408
Get out.

301
00:31:00,328 --> 00:31:02,048
Hey! You!

302
00:31:03,608 --> 00:31:04,528
Hey!

303
00:31:10,008 --> 00:31:11,128
Son of a bitch.

304
00:31:16,528 --> 00:31:19,568
Stop, you son of a bitch!

305
00:31:28,328 --> 00:31:29,928
Wait till I catch you.

306
00:33:07,128 --> 00:33:08,328
Son of a bitch.

307
00:33:10,408 --> 00:33:11,888
Why are you running away?

308
00:33:13,288 --> 00:33:14,568
Think you'd get away?

309
00:33:19,088 --> 00:33:20,888
Asshole,
what did you do with my girls?

310
00:33:21,888 --> 00:33:23,368
You already sold them?

311
00:33:24,288 --> 00:33:26,528
Asshole, who the hell are you?

312
00:33:39,288 --> 00:33:40,488
Ji Young-min
Anyang city

313
00:33:40,608 --> 00:33:41,808
What the hell?

314
00:33:43,488 --> 00:33:46,128
Where's your house?

315
00:33:48,488 --> 00:33:49,448
Answer me.

316
00:33:49,608 --> 00:33:50,888
Answer me now.

317
00:33:51,688 --> 00:33:53,008
Anyang city.

318
00:33:53,128 --> 00:33:58,008
That's your address on paper.
Where do you live now?

319
00:33:58,608 --> 00:34:00,768
Not talking? You block me?

320
00:34:00,928 --> 00:34:02,408
You son of a bitch.

321
00:34:03,208 --> 00:34:05,208
You pain in the ass.

322
00:34:05,808 --> 00:34:07,888
- Move, now!
- Move your car back!

323
00:34:08,008 --> 00:34:09,528
Come here.

324
00:34:11,008 --> 00:34:12,408
Bastards.

325
00:34:12,528 --> 00:34:15,088
You caused this mess,
asshole!

326
00:34:15,688 --> 00:34:16,728
Move.

327
00:34:17,528 --> 00:34:18,728
Out of the way.

328
00:34:18,968 --> 00:34:20,768
- Hey, Miss!
- What kind of person did do that...

329
00:34:22,408 --> 00:34:23,808
Move.
Out of the way.

330
00:34:24,968 --> 00:34:27,368
What are you doing?
Get out!

331
00:34:28,808 --> 00:34:30,728
Get in the car.

332
00:34:31,528 --> 00:34:33,688
If there's an accident,
you should go around.

333
00:34:33,808 --> 00:34:35,288
This won't solve anything.

334
00:34:36,208 --> 00:34:37,608
Move your car.

335
00:34:38,048 --> 00:34:40,408
Reverse!
Move back!

336
00:34:40,528 --> 00:34:41,448
Sir!

337
00:34:41,968 --> 00:34:43,168
Hey, you!

338
00:34:44,288 --> 00:34:46,448
You can't park like this.

339
00:34:46,768 --> 00:34:47,888
Is that your car?

340
00:34:48,488 --> 00:34:49,608
Yes.

341
00:34:53,848 --> 00:34:55,248
Are you a cop?

342
00:34:56,808 --> 00:34:58,128
Yes, I am.

343
00:34:58,248 --> 00:35:01,008
Show me your badge.

344
00:35:01,128 --> 00:35:04,448
I left it at the police station.

345
00:35:06,608 --> 00:35:08,208
This is 390.

346
00:35:08,328 --> 00:35:09,928
Come in Mangwon station.

347
00:35:10,088 --> 00:35:11,368
ID check.

348
00:35:12,488 --> 00:35:13,968
What station do you work at?

349
00:35:14,088 --> 00:35:16,568
I was in a task force unit
2 years ago.

350
00:35:16,688 --> 00:35:18,088
Let's call them.

351
00:35:18,248 --> 00:35:19,528
Let's go to the station first.

352
00:35:19,688 --> 00:35:21,928
But my girls are being sold
this very moment.

353
00:35:22,088 --> 00:35:24,448
Shut up! Let's go and talk!

354
00:35:25,048 --> 00:35:26,128
You son of a bitch.

355
00:35:26,248 --> 00:35:28,048
I told you to shut up!

356
00:35:35,368 --> 00:35:36,488
Damn it.

357
00:35:36,808 --> 00:35:38,128
No answer?

358
00:35:40,568 --> 00:35:44,168
No cell phone, either.
Nothing he says makes sense.

359
00:35:44,328 --> 00:35:46,688
All we need to do
is go to his house.

360
00:35:47,488 --> 00:35:49,728
Please write it all down,
frankly.

361
00:35:49,888 --> 00:35:51,008
Yes, sir.

362
00:35:51,128 --> 00:35:54,448
People like him need to be deported.
How dare you impersonate a cop!

363
00:35:54,568 --> 00:35:57,688
Asshole, tell the truth.
Where did you sell the girls?

364
00:35:57,808 --> 00:35:58,928
Be quiet!

365
00:35:59,048 --> 00:36:00,088
Why are you shouting?

366
00:36:00,208 --> 00:36:01,888
Ask that bastard directly.

367
00:36:02,048 --> 00:36:03,328
You're out of line.

368
00:36:03,488 --> 00:36:05,448
Ask him!
Don't just get on my case!

369
00:36:06,448 --> 00:36:07,568
You really sold them?

370
00:36:09,128 --> 00:36:10,168
Are you crazy?

371
00:36:10,288 --> 00:36:12,448
Sorry.
He just wanted me to ask.

372
00:36:12,968 --> 00:36:14,488
This is fucking insane.

373
00:36:15,848 --> 00:36:17,768
Block them, idiot!

374
00:36:18,088 --> 00:36:19,968
Be quiet!

375
00:36:20,768 --> 00:36:21,768
Which hospital?

376
00:36:21,928 --> 00:36:23,968
St. Mary's Hospital.
I'll call you from there.

377
00:36:24,688 --> 00:36:27,528
Why'd you throw shit on
his face, you crazy bastard?

378
00:36:29,648 --> 00:36:31,528
Yes, Captain.
I'm on my way now.

379
00:36:31,688 --> 00:36:33,848
How can I stop someone
who pops up out of nowhere?

380
00:36:34,368 --> 00:36:37,088
Hey, cover the seat first
before he gets in.

381
00:36:37,928 --> 00:36:39,488
Yes, the rest went to
the hospital.

382
00:36:40,208 --> 00:36:43,248
Yes, I'll bring him in first.

383
00:36:45,888 --> 00:36:48,448
Mr. Ji Young-min,
whose car is that?

384
00:36:49,048 --> 00:36:51,008
- Pardon? Car?
- Yes.

385
00:36:53,088 --> 00:36:54,568
It belongs to someone I know.

386
00:36:55,088 --> 00:36:56,488
Who is that person you know?

387
00:36:56,648 --> 00:36:57,648
What?

388
00:36:58,448 --> 00:37:00,048
What's his name?

389
00:37:00,168 --> 00:37:02,208
I can't remember.

390
00:37:02,368 --> 00:37:03,768
Do you know his number?

391
00:37:04,768 --> 00:37:06,248
It's at home.

392
00:37:12,048 --> 00:37:13,368
Something wrong?

393
00:37:13,608 --> 00:37:16,528
No, it's strange you don't know
the car owner.

394
00:37:18,688 --> 00:37:20,768
I have a very bad memory.

395
00:37:20,888 --> 00:37:22,968
Okay, just keep writing.

396
00:37:31,048 --> 00:37:33,688
Mr. Ji, does your number
start with 011 or 016?

397
00:37:33,808 --> 00:37:34,928
016

398
00:37:37,088 --> 00:37:38,848
I thought you didn't have a phone.

399
00:37:39,768 --> 00:37:40,768
What?

400
00:37:41,128 --> 00:37:42,608
Where's your cell phone?

401
00:37:43,528 --> 00:37:44,528
At home.

402
00:37:45,048 --> 00:37:46,368
Then why did you lie?

403
00:37:47,528 --> 00:37:48,848
Tell me your number.

404
00:37:51,088 --> 00:37:52,568
It's 4885, right?

405
00:37:53,008 --> 00:37:53,848
No.

406
00:37:53,968 --> 00:37:56,448
Come on, I can find out easily.

407
00:38:00,808 --> 00:38:02,088
Did you sell the girls?

408
00:38:02,248 --> 00:38:03,528
No.

409
00:38:03,688 --> 00:38:06,088
Come on, did you sell the girls?

410
00:38:06,808 --> 00:38:08,288
I said no.

411
00:38:09,288 --> 00:38:10,888
I didn't sell them.

412
00:38:12,008 --> 00:38:13,488
- I killed them...
- What?

413
00:38:14,008 --> 00:38:16,088
- Nothing.
- You just said something.

414
00:38:16,208 --> 00:38:18,208
- What?
- You said that you killed them.

415
00:38:20,808 --> 00:38:22,048
Yes.

416
00:38:22,368 --> 00:38:23,488
What?

417
00:38:24,768 --> 00:38:27,008
Yes, I killed them.

418
00:38:36,488 --> 00:38:37,648
Whose shit is it?
Is it yours?

419
00:38:37,768 --> 00:38:39,848
History will be the judge of things!
Damn you all!

420
00:38:40,008 --> 00:38:42,648
- Crazy asshole.
- What a crazy...

421
00:38:43,248 --> 00:38:45,408
We're in deep trouble for this.

422
00:38:45,568 --> 00:38:46,968
This is crazy.

423
00:38:47,088 --> 00:38:48,408
I've been suffering.

424
00:38:48,528 --> 00:38:51,008
They've stopped the water supply
and I haven't washed for ages.

425
00:38:51,128 --> 00:38:52,928
Jung-ho
I can't even flush
my own shit.

426
00:38:53,048 --> 00:38:54,928
Shut the hell up!

427
00:38:55,528 --> 00:38:56,648
Be quiet.

428
00:38:59,568 --> 00:39:00,688
What?

429
00:39:01,128 --> 00:39:02,328
I'm busy now.

430
00:39:02,728 --> 00:39:05,888
What are you talking about?

431
00:39:06,288 --> 00:39:08,728
How do you know
whether he killed them or not?

432
00:39:08,888 --> 00:39:10,048
Anyway...

433
00:39:10,568 --> 00:39:11,608
Yes.

434
00:39:12,208 --> 00:39:13,328
9 of them?

435
00:39:15,088 --> 00:39:16,568
He said he killed 9 people?

436
00:39:17,288 --> 00:39:19,368
Hey, Jung-ho.

437
00:39:20,168 --> 00:39:21,768
Bastard.

438
00:39:24,688 --> 00:39:26,488
That Son of...

439
00:39:29,968 --> 00:39:30,808
Detective Oh.

440
00:39:30,928 --> 00:39:31,848
Yes?

441
00:39:33,128 --> 00:39:34,848
Remember
the Mapo murder case?

442
00:39:34,968 --> 00:39:37,888
- 3 murdered women?
- Yeah.

443
00:39:38,048 --> 00:39:40,208
How many occurred
in Mangwon district?

444
00:39:40,528 --> 00:39:42,088
All of them happened
in Mangwon.

445
00:39:42,528 --> 00:39:43,528
In the ally at dawn.

446
00:39:44,448 --> 00:39:45,448
Really?

447
00:39:47,328 --> 00:39:48,328
Why?

448
00:39:49,808 --> 00:39:50,928
Never mind.

449
00:39:57,008 --> 00:39:58,208
What shall we do?

450
00:39:59,208 --> 00:40:00,528
Let's take him in first.

451
00:40:00,648 --> 00:40:02,248
His statement makes sense.

452
00:40:03,048 --> 00:40:04,008
It does, doesn't it?

453
00:40:04,128 --> 00:40:06,208
Bunch of idiots wasting time.

454
00:40:06,328 --> 00:40:08,608
What did you say?

455
00:40:08,928 --> 00:40:10,048
You're way out of line.

456
00:40:10,168 --> 00:40:11,008
Watch what you say.

457
00:40:11,128 --> 00:40:13,168
He's pretending to
be crazy now.

458
00:40:13,288 --> 00:40:14,408
Hey!

459
00:40:14,568 --> 00:40:16,128
Shut up, you pimp.

460
00:40:16,288 --> 00:40:18,728
You're worse than
this asshole.

461
00:40:18,888 --> 00:40:22,168
You sell out your old police badge
to pimp girls.

462
00:40:22,328 --> 00:40:23,168
Take him to the car.

463
00:40:23,288 --> 00:40:24,768
- Yes?
- Put him in the car!

464
00:40:24,928 --> 00:40:25,728
Yes, sir!

465
00:40:25,888 --> 00:40:29,008
We're not taking the blame
for him beating this guy up.

466
00:40:30,208 --> 00:40:31,608
Let's not be like this, okay?

467
00:40:31,728 --> 00:40:34,168
Let's go.
Hurry up.

468
00:40:36,248 --> 00:40:36,968
Hello.

469
00:40:37,128 --> 00:40:38,208
Gil-woo!

470
00:40:38,368 --> 00:40:39,488
Where are you going?

471
00:40:39,608 --> 00:40:40,528
Those idiots are holding him.

472
00:40:40,648 --> 00:40:41,888
- And just...
- Hold on.

473
00:40:42,888 --> 00:40:44,168
Can I help you?

474
00:40:45,048 --> 00:40:46,448
I'm from the Task Force Unit.

475
00:40:46,968 --> 00:40:47,968
Where?

476
00:40:48,128 --> 00:40:49,808
The Task Force Unit
at the Seoul station.

477
00:40:49,928 --> 00:40:51,528
You must've come
for the Mapo case files.

478
00:40:51,688 --> 00:40:54,208
No, I came for that guy.

479
00:40:54,728 --> 00:40:55,688
What?

480
00:40:55,808 --> 00:40:56,928
I'm taking him in.

481
00:41:13,848 --> 00:41:15,248
Sorry to wake you up, sir.

482
00:41:16,528 --> 00:41:17,248
What is this all about?

483
00:41:17,368 --> 00:41:19,328
It's a bit complicated.

484
00:41:19,488 --> 00:41:20,888
Damn it!

485
00:41:21,008 --> 00:41:22,128
Who is this?

486
00:41:22,568 --> 00:41:23,968
Yes, this man is...

487
00:41:24,088 --> 00:41:25,288
Is he the shit thrower?

488
00:41:25,448 --> 00:41:26,728
Yes, I believe so.

489
00:41:26,888 --> 00:41:29,528
Crazy bastard,
why'd you throw shit at someone?

490
00:41:29,648 --> 00:41:31,528
What is he saying?

491
00:41:31,688 --> 00:41:35,368
Looks like he has to urinate.
Would you like to talk to him?

492
00:41:35,528 --> 00:41:36,728
Forget it.

493
00:41:37,608 --> 00:41:38,928
So are you sure about this?

494
00:41:39,048 --> 00:41:40,088
Yes, Gil-woo is.

495
00:41:40,208 --> 00:41:42,008
Don't use him as an excuse.

496
00:41:42,328 --> 00:41:44,608
- Sorry, sir.
- Okay.

497
00:41:44,728 --> 00:41:45,648
You son of bitch!

498
00:41:47,208 --> 00:41:48,448
Why is it so noisy in here!

499
00:41:50,568 --> 00:41:51,848
Sir!

500
00:41:52,488 --> 00:41:54,848
Crazy bastards.

501
00:41:55,648 --> 00:41:56,848
Who's Ji Young-min?

502
00:42:00,648 --> 00:42:02,048
Are you Ji Young-min?

503
00:42:02,848 --> 00:42:04,048
Yes.

504
00:42:04,168 --> 00:42:05,488
What happened to your face?

505
00:42:08,608 --> 00:42:11,248
Are you all out of your minds?

506
00:42:11,368 --> 00:42:14,128
Sir, we didn't do anything.

507
00:42:14,248 --> 00:42:15,568
Shut up!

508
00:42:17,728 --> 00:42:19,008
Come outside.

509
00:42:19,728 --> 00:42:21,208
Come out now!

510
00:42:27,208 --> 00:42:30,328
- Have a good life.
- Let me loose.

511
00:42:31,328 --> 00:42:32,728
Who beat him?

512
00:42:33,128 --> 00:42:35,048
- Well...
- They did it?

513
00:42:35,928 --> 00:42:37,728
- I don't know, sir.
- Find out who beat him

514
00:42:37,848 --> 00:42:40,008
and then bring him in.

515
00:42:40,328 --> 00:42:41,288
Yes, sir!

516
00:42:41,608 --> 00:42:43,288
- You know the situation we're in?
- Yes, sir.

517
00:42:43,408 --> 00:42:44,888
We're all dead if this case fails.

518
00:42:45,048 --> 00:42:46,048
Yes, sir.

519
00:42:50,888 --> 00:42:52,288
Who did this to you?

520
00:42:52,448 --> 00:42:53,728
That guy inside.

521
00:42:53,848 --> 00:42:55,248
- Who?
- Hey!

522
00:42:55,368 --> 00:42:58,048
There's more than
one in there!

523
00:42:58,448 --> 00:42:59,448
That man over there.

524
00:42:59,608 --> 00:43:01,488
Come here,
you son of a bitch.

525
00:43:01,608 --> 00:43:04,088
You lie to all of them?

526
00:43:04,208 --> 00:43:04,928
You son of a bitch!

527
00:43:05,088 --> 00:43:07,048
- Chill.
- That little...!

528
00:43:07,208 --> 00:43:08,968
Cut it out.
Let's go to the station first.

529
00:43:09,128 --> 00:43:11,168
Jung-ho, you can do it there.

530
00:43:11,328 --> 00:43:13,688
Right, let's go.

531
00:43:13,808 --> 00:43:15,488
Gil-woo, come here.

532
00:43:16,008 --> 00:43:17,808
Let's go and do it, okay?

533
00:43:18,808 --> 00:43:20,408
You're sure about this, right?

534
00:43:20,528 --> 00:43:21,448
Yes, I'm sure.

535
00:43:21,608 --> 00:43:23,088
- Absolutely sure?
- Yes, I am.

536
00:43:23,208 --> 00:43:24,608
Okay, let's go.

537
00:43:27,608 --> 00:43:28,808
- Let's go.
- Okay.

538
00:43:29,528 --> 00:43:31,008
- Wait! Stop!
- Why?

539
00:43:31,168 --> 00:43:31,968
Where'd that bastard go?

540
00:43:32,128 --> 00:43:33,808
- Who?
- Jung-ho.

541
00:43:33,928 --> 00:43:35,168
Damn it.

542
00:43:40,488 --> 00:43:41,568
There's that bastard.

543
00:43:41,728 --> 00:43:43,408
Hey!

544
00:43:43,528 --> 00:43:44,648
Come to the office!

545
00:43:44,808 --> 00:43:46,688
- Okay.
- You better come!

546
00:43:46,808 --> 00:43:48,008
Okay!

547
00:44:14,888 --> 00:44:16,008
Owner: Kwon Hae-gab

548
00:44:17,288 --> 00:44:18,888
Damn bastard.

549
00:44:53,168 --> 00:44:54,488
Hey.

550
00:44:55,368 --> 00:44:56,688
Hey!

551
00:44:58,848 --> 00:45:00,688
- Me?
- Yeah, you.

552
00:45:00,808 --> 00:45:02,128
What did you kill the girls with?

553
00:45:03,408 --> 00:45:04,728
With a chisel.

554
00:45:05,128 --> 00:45:06,728
The ones to crack stones?

555
00:45:07,048 --> 00:45:07,968
Yes.

556
00:45:08,408 --> 00:45:10,008
- Is that right?
- Yes,

557
00:45:10,128 --> 00:45:11,528
it was a narrow
blunt instrument.

558
00:45:13,208 --> 00:45:14,608
Okay.

559
00:45:15,128 --> 00:45:18,528
I need to pee really bad.
Let me out.

560
00:45:18,688 --> 00:45:20,568
Shut up.

561
00:45:20,688 --> 00:45:23,448
Or else I'll yank your dick out.

562
00:45:24,168 --> 00:45:25,248
Detective.

563
00:45:25,408 --> 00:45:26,688
What?

564
00:45:27,808 --> 00:45:30,248
Kim Mi-jin is probably still alive.

565
00:45:31,168 --> 00:45:32,568
What's he talking about?

566
00:45:32,648 --> 00:45:33,968
Kim Mi-jin.

567
00:45:34,568 --> 00:45:36,568
The girl that guy was looking for.

568
00:45:36,688 --> 00:45:37,888
Where is she now?

569
00:45:38,048 --> 00:45:39,328
In Anyang city?

570
00:45:40,808 --> 00:45:42,048
Why?

571
00:45:43,688 --> 00:45:46,448
Why would the victim be there?

572
00:45:48,008 --> 00:45:50,408
Wait, stop the car.

573
00:45:50,528 --> 00:45:53,848
That's just his address on paper.
He lives in Mangwon district.

574
00:45:54,248 --> 00:45:56,448
That's where I caught him.

575
00:45:58,288 --> 00:46:00,928
Bastard hangs up the phone
before I'm finished.

576
00:46:04,248 --> 00:46:04,928
Car registration

577
00:46:28,128 --> 00:46:29,408
Who is it?

578
00:46:31,688 --> 00:46:32,768
Do you know this man?

579
00:46:34,368 --> 00:46:35,288
No.

580
00:46:35,888 --> 00:46:37,248
These keys?

581
00:46:37,608 --> 00:46:38,888
I don't know.

582
00:46:39,048 --> 00:46:40,528
Look carefully.

583
00:46:40,648 --> 00:46:42,168
It's the first time I've seen it.

584
00:46:45,368 --> 00:46:47,048
Where did they go?

585
00:46:47,208 --> 00:46:50,408
They were going to some meeting,
but I don't remember.

586
00:46:51,328 --> 00:46:52,448
Yanpyung 11 a.m.
Yangpyung?

587
00:46:52,568 --> 00:46:54,528
Yes, I think so.

588
00:46:56,808 --> 00:46:57,888
Yangpyung is...

589
00:46:58,888 --> 00:47:02,328
Anyway, they must've past
the corner store.

590
00:47:08,648 --> 00:47:10,848
What took you so long, idiot?

591
00:47:10,968 --> 00:47:12,368
What happened?

592
00:47:12,968 --> 00:47:14,208
What about Mi-jin?

593
00:47:14,328 --> 00:47:15,448
I couldn't find her.

594
00:47:15,568 --> 00:47:16,888
What?

595
00:47:17,008 --> 00:47:18,408
See that store
across the street?

596
00:47:18,728 --> 00:47:20,728
- Yes.
- See that alley next to it?

597
00:47:20,848 --> 00:47:22,528
- Yes.
- So,

598
00:47:22,968 --> 00:47:26,008
Search every house from there
to this address with this.

599
00:47:28,728 --> 00:47:30,128
- What is this?
- Find houses

600
00:47:30,248 --> 00:47:34,168
with basements,
where the cell phone wouldn't work.

601
00:47:34,488 --> 00:47:36,088
Where is this house?

602
00:47:37,448 --> 00:47:38,568
Come here.

603
00:47:41,088 --> 00:47:43,168
- See that top over there?
- Yes.

604
00:47:44,168 --> 00:47:45,728
Where the hell
are you looking, idiot?

605
00:47:45,888 --> 00:47:47,648
That top over the cross.

606
00:47:48,008 --> 00:47:49,208
Yes.

607
00:47:49,528 --> 00:47:50,728
Right there.

608
00:47:52,888 --> 00:47:54,768
Why don't we just report it?

609
00:47:55,288 --> 00:47:56,128
They know already.

610
00:47:56,248 --> 00:47:58,128
Then why
go through the trouble?

611
00:47:58,248 --> 00:47:59,968
Just do what I say, asshole.

612
00:48:00,088 --> 00:48:01,688
We have to find Mi-jin.

613
00:48:03,048 --> 00:48:04,288
I got it.

614
00:48:06,728 --> 00:48:07,528
Search every corner!

615
00:48:07,688 --> 00:48:08,688
Okay!

616
00:48:17,248 --> 00:48:19,008
Shit.

617
00:48:28,368 --> 00:48:30,928
If you make an arrest
without a warrant,

618
00:48:31,048 --> 00:48:33,328
you need approval by
a prosecutor within 12 hours.

619
00:48:34,248 --> 00:48:35,328
12 hours?

620
00:48:35,688 --> 00:48:36,888
Yes.

621
00:48:39,528 --> 00:48:40,928
What if it isn't approved?

622
00:48:42,088 --> 00:48:43,128
We have to release him.

623
00:48:44,128 --> 00:48:45,288
Shit.

624
00:48:45,448 --> 00:48:46,528
Where are you?

625
00:48:46,688 --> 00:48:49,328
It's already 2.
What have you been doing?

626
00:48:50,888 --> 00:48:54,048
Why'd you go to Mangwon
after Anyang city?

627
00:48:54,648 --> 00:48:57,888
Then you should've dropped off
the shit thrower.

628
00:49:20,808 --> 00:49:22,128
Sit down.

629
00:49:25,928 --> 00:49:28,928
So did you hit them with a chisel
or hammer them with it?

630
00:49:29,088 --> 00:49:30,768
Used the hammer, of course.

631
00:49:31,288 --> 00:49:32,408
Give me your hand.

632
00:49:33,968 --> 00:49:35,288
Relax.

633
00:49:36,848 --> 00:49:37,688
Why'd you kill them like that?

634
00:49:37,808 --> 00:49:40,568
I choked them and used knives,
but they were too painful.

635
00:49:44,808 --> 00:49:46,808
I saw how pigs were killed
and did the same.

636
00:49:48,008 --> 00:49:49,168
And then?

637
00:49:49,288 --> 00:49:51,008
- Hang them on the wall.
- What?

638
00:49:51,208 --> 00:49:52,128
Yes?

639
00:49:52,288 --> 00:49:53,088
Hang what?

640
00:49:53,248 --> 00:49:54,728
Their bodies, of course.

641
00:49:54,888 --> 00:49:55,968
Say ah.

642
00:50:00,248 --> 00:50:01,448
And then?

643
00:50:02,368 --> 00:50:04,128
You know that muscle
behind the ankles?

644
00:50:04,288 --> 00:50:05,568
- The Achilles tendon?
- Yes.

645
00:50:05,728 --> 00:50:07,488
I slice it with a knife.

646
00:50:07,648 --> 00:50:09,728
- Of the dead body?
- Yes.

647
00:50:09,848 --> 00:50:11,048
Why?

648
00:50:11,208 --> 00:50:13,848
To drain out the blood.
Otherwise they're too heavy to lift.

649
00:50:15,208 --> 00:50:16,248
That's right.

650
00:50:16,968 --> 00:50:18,648
That's how
the corpses get lighter.

651
00:50:19,448 --> 00:50:20,808
So what did you do next?

652
00:50:20,968 --> 00:50:25,128
Leave it around for a day,
drain out all the blood and mess.

653
00:50:25,448 --> 00:50:27,648
Then I ax the bodies
and bury them.

654
00:50:27,768 --> 00:50:28,888
Where?

655
00:50:29,008 --> 00:50:29,928
Yes?

656
00:50:30,368 --> 00:50:32,048
Where'd you bury
the dead bodies?

657
00:50:33,928 --> 00:50:35,488
Here and there.

658
00:50:37,648 --> 00:50:39,728
Here and there is where?
Tell me exactly.

659
00:50:39,848 --> 00:50:41,168
Well...

660
00:50:42,168 --> 00:50:44,928
You wouldn't have buried
9 people in your front yard.

661
00:50:45,048 --> 00:50:46,528
Not 9.

662
00:50:46,968 --> 00:50:47,968
What?

663
00:50:48,128 --> 00:50:49,128
It's 12.

664
00:50:51,848 --> 00:50:53,888
Why 12? Wasn't it 9?

665
00:50:55,008 --> 00:50:57,448
Come to think of it, it was 12.

666
00:50:57,608 --> 00:50:58,888
Are you kidding me?

667
00:50:59,048 --> 00:50:59,968
Gil-woo!

668
00:51:03,648 --> 00:51:07,728
Just tell us what you remember.

669
00:51:07,848 --> 00:51:09,648
You're doing well.

670
00:51:10,728 --> 00:51:13,408
I was driving and
the Equus popped out.

671
00:51:13,528 --> 00:51:15,688
It slammed into my car,
and this rat was driving.

672
00:51:16,328 --> 00:51:17,528
That's why you beat him?

673
00:51:17,648 --> 00:51:20,688
No, I held on to him
and called 4885.

674
00:51:20,808 --> 00:51:22,208
- And his phone is...
- Hey.

675
00:51:22,928 --> 00:51:25,368
Just answer what I ask you.

676
00:51:26,088 --> 00:51:27,848
So you beat him, right?

677
00:51:28,968 --> 00:51:31,008
It was you
who messed up his face, right?

678
00:51:33,648 --> 00:51:34,648
What are you doing?

679
00:51:38,648 --> 00:51:40,528
Yes? Now?

680
00:51:41,728 --> 00:51:42,928
Yes, sir.

681
00:51:45,568 --> 00:51:47,248
The chief wants to see you.

682
00:51:47,848 --> 00:51:50,408
Testimony
First, press your finger.

683
00:52:03,088 --> 00:52:04,408
Go to Mi-jin's house?

684
00:52:05,288 --> 00:52:07,768
Yes, go with him.

685
00:52:09,448 --> 00:52:10,928
- Why?
- To do a DNA test

686
00:52:11,048 --> 00:52:12,848
on the blood
on his shirt and her samples.

687
00:52:12,968 --> 00:52:15,648
So you actually believe
what this bastard's saying?

688
00:52:15,768 --> 00:52:16,768
Hey! Just go!

689
00:52:16,928 --> 00:52:20,448
I doubt this bastard killed anyone.
Just search the neighborhood.

690
00:52:20,568 --> 00:52:21,688
Hey! Jung-ho!

691
00:52:22,288 --> 00:52:24,568
Give me a break.

692
00:52:26,888 --> 00:52:29,048
Does it taste delicious,
you bastard!

693
00:52:29,168 --> 00:52:30,768
Why do you keep hitting him?

694
00:52:30,888 --> 00:52:32,688
Is this time to eat chocolate?

695
00:52:33,008 --> 00:52:34,328
Hey! Jung-ho!

696
00:52:39,168 --> 00:52:41,728
Bastard.

697
00:52:45,608 --> 00:52:47,288
Is it true that the suspect
threw human feces?

698
00:52:47,408 --> 00:52:49,488
Have you identified
the suspect?

699
00:52:52,408 --> 00:52:53,528
Almost there.

700
00:52:54,408 --> 00:52:57,168
Turn right and go straight?

701
00:53:00,328 --> 00:53:01,448
Straight in?

702
00:53:03,408 --> 00:53:04,408
Steps?

703
00:53:05,248 --> 00:53:07,208
Downstairs?

704
00:53:13,008 --> 00:53:14,128
The first one?

705
00:53:15,888 --> 00:53:16,888
Okay.

706
00:53:18,688 --> 00:53:20,768
Anybody home?
Anybody there?

707
00:53:20,888 --> 00:53:22,768
Of course nobody's here.

708
00:53:24,928 --> 00:53:26,528
What shall we do now?

709
00:53:27,328 --> 00:53:28,448
Let's go to
the owner's house.

710
00:53:28,568 --> 00:53:30,368
Move, move.

711
00:53:36,488 --> 00:53:37,728
What is that?

712
00:53:38,408 --> 00:53:39,648
You scared me.

713
00:53:39,768 --> 00:53:41,448
You should've answered
if you were inside.

714
00:53:41,608 --> 00:53:43,648
- Is this the police?
- Hey, you!

715
00:53:43,808 --> 00:53:45,008
Strangers are breaking in.

716
00:53:45,328 --> 00:53:47,688
Mapo-gu Sangsoo-dong 21-15.

717
00:53:48,488 --> 00:53:50,088
They're coming inside!

718
00:53:50,408 --> 00:53:51,448
Give it to me.

719
00:53:53,008 --> 00:53:57,008
Who the hell are you?

720
00:53:58,568 --> 00:53:59,688
I'm asking you.

721
00:54:07,208 --> 00:54:08,408
Are you Mi-jin's daughter?

722
00:54:15,248 --> 00:54:18,488
This place is a mess.

723
00:54:18,608 --> 00:54:20,208
What are you doing here?

724
00:54:20,928 --> 00:54:22,408
Go stay over there.

725
00:54:22,568 --> 00:54:24,128
Why are you
taking someone's hair?

726
00:54:24,768 --> 00:54:26,728
You little prick, go away.

727
00:54:27,368 --> 00:54:29,328
Why are you taking her hair?

728
00:54:29,448 --> 00:54:32,008
Aren't you going to sleep?

729
00:54:32,328 --> 00:54:33,928
You go to sleep.

730
00:54:35,128 --> 00:54:37,928
You're just like your mom.

731
00:54:38,088 --> 00:54:39,368
What about my mom?

732
00:54:39,528 --> 00:54:40,808
You little brat.

733
00:54:41,328 --> 00:54:43,288
All done. So what now?

734
00:54:44,128 --> 00:54:46,488
Leave, of course.

735
00:54:53,048 --> 00:54:54,368
What's your name?

736
00:54:57,768 --> 00:54:58,768
Take it.

737
00:55:00,328 --> 00:55:02,048
Call me
if you get into any trouble.

738
00:55:04,368 --> 00:55:05,368
Let's go.

739
00:55:20,368 --> 00:55:21,848
Damn it.

740
00:55:23,808 --> 00:55:28,488
According to witnesses,

741
00:55:28,608 --> 00:55:31,568
Bastard made me
lose my appetite.

742
00:55:32,648 --> 00:55:34,048
Where's my mom?

743
00:55:35,248 --> 00:55:36,568
She's working.

744
00:55:36,888 --> 00:55:38,568
Then why'd you take her hair?

745
00:55:39,168 --> 00:55:40,928
For a DNA test?

746
00:55:43,568 --> 00:55:44,768
You're unbelievable.

747
00:55:44,928 --> 00:55:46,808
My mom isn't working now,
is she?

748
00:55:49,048 --> 00:55:50,248
Something happened to her?

749
00:55:52,128 --> 00:55:56,008
Don't you have
somewhere to go?

750
00:55:59,408 --> 00:56:00,808
How much did you search?

751
00:56:02,488 --> 00:56:05,608
I'll be there soon,
so search around some more.

752
00:56:06,048 --> 00:56:10,608
Also, do you know anyone
who can look after a kid?

753
00:56:13,488 --> 00:56:14,608
Okay, bye.

754
00:56:23,848 --> 00:56:26,128
Look behind you!

755
00:56:26,448 --> 00:56:28,048
Is there a cigarette?

756
00:56:28,168 --> 00:56:29,008
Yes.

757
00:56:29,128 --> 00:56:31,328
Get back there.

758
00:56:31,448 --> 00:56:34,208
Throw it out the window.

759
00:56:35,288 --> 00:56:36,488
Is it gone?

760
00:56:36,648 --> 00:56:37,848
Yes.

761
00:56:38,728 --> 00:56:40,448
Is there a burned mark?

762
00:56:40,568 --> 00:56:42,048
Yes.

763
00:56:43,168 --> 00:56:45,488
Damn it, nothing's helping me.

764
00:56:45,608 --> 00:56:47,408
What a day.

765
00:56:47,528 --> 00:56:49,888
You called my mom before,
right?

766
00:56:50,808 --> 00:56:53,648
Didn't you ask my mom
to go to work tonight?

767
00:56:53,768 --> 00:56:56,248
I'll send you back home
if you keep bothering me.

768
00:56:57,248 --> 00:56:58,448
Filth.

769
00:56:58,568 --> 00:57:00,648
What did you say?

770
00:57:00,768 --> 00:57:02,368
What? Filth?

771
00:57:06,728 --> 00:57:08,248
Get out!

772
00:57:09,528 --> 00:57:11,968
The Mapo murders
are also included.

773
00:57:12,608 --> 00:57:14,488
But who's this woman
that's alive?

774
00:57:14,608 --> 00:57:17,808
He seems to be lying.
She's probably been murdered.

775
00:57:17,928 --> 00:57:19,928
Except for the Mapo murders,

776
00:57:20,048 --> 00:57:22,408
they were killed at his house
and you can't find the bodies?

777
00:57:22,568 --> 00:57:23,368
No, sir.

778
00:57:23,528 --> 00:57:24,608
If you don't know the address,

779
00:57:24,768 --> 00:57:26,528
it means
you don't know anything.

780
00:57:26,688 --> 00:57:29,248
The suspect can't remember
the address,

781
00:57:29,368 --> 00:57:32,408
but we can find it quickly
if we start searching in the morning.

782
00:57:32,928 --> 00:57:35,968
Why aren't his motives
written down?

783
00:57:36,088 --> 00:57:39,128
He kept on talking gibberish.
No particular motivation.

784
00:57:39,248 --> 00:57:42,288
Then make one up!
What the hell is this?

785
00:57:42,408 --> 00:57:43,928
Yes, sir.

786
00:57:45,888 --> 00:57:46,888
You know
the situation we're in?

787
00:57:47,008 --> 00:57:48,008
- Yes, sir.
- Yes, sir.

788
00:57:48,128 --> 00:57:49,848
We die if we blow this.

789
00:57:50,248 --> 00:57:53,088
Get this right
if you want to keep your jobs.

790
00:57:53,248 --> 00:57:55,488
So that the mayor's incident
shuts up, okay?

791
00:57:55,648 --> 00:57:56,568
- Yes, sir.
- Yes, sir.

792
00:57:59,768 --> 00:58:00,688
Who is it?

793
00:58:00,808 --> 00:58:03,488
The police. Open the door.

794
00:58:05,328 --> 00:58:08,848
Sit down.

795
00:58:09,168 --> 00:58:10,008
Sit comfortably.

796
00:58:10,128 --> 00:58:11,328
Yes.

797
00:58:12,448 --> 00:58:13,448
Lady.

798
00:58:13,888 --> 00:58:16,528
How can a sister
not know where her brother lives?

799
00:58:16,648 --> 00:58:18,528
We really don't know.

800
00:58:19,048 --> 00:58:21,568
We haven't seen him
for a long time.

801
00:58:21,728 --> 00:58:23,128
How long?

802
00:58:23,848 --> 00:58:26,488
About 3 years.

803
00:58:26,608 --> 00:58:27,928
Where did he live then?

804
00:58:28,928 --> 00:58:30,328
In prison, right?

805
00:58:31,328 --> 00:58:32,728
Yes, in prison.

806
00:58:33,048 --> 00:58:34,848
What a screwed-up family.

807
00:58:35,528 --> 00:58:37,408
Now let's put things
in order, yes?

808
00:58:37,568 --> 00:58:39,048
Like I said before,

809
00:58:39,208 --> 00:58:44,328
your brother and brother-in-law
sold 3 of my girls.

810
00:58:44,448 --> 00:58:47,208
But I've paid twenty thousand
for those girls.

811
00:58:47,528 --> 00:58:49,048
What shall we do about that?

812
00:58:57,408 --> 00:58:59,008
Let's sign a contract.

813
00:59:00,288 --> 00:59:01,768
Why aren't you answering?

814
00:59:08,808 --> 00:59:11,368
Byeong-soo!

815
00:59:11,488 --> 00:59:13,688
Are you all right?

816
00:59:14,288 --> 00:59:15,888
Everything's okay.

817
00:59:19,848 --> 00:59:22,208
He was like this
ever since he was a baby.

818
00:59:23,128 --> 00:59:27,088
My son was bleeding
when I came back home.

819
00:59:27,968 --> 00:59:30,448
My damn brother
was the only one home.

820
00:59:30,568 --> 00:59:34,008
Ever since then,
I barely saw my brother.

821
00:59:36,928 --> 00:59:38,608
Where are we going?

822
00:59:40,088 --> 00:59:41,688
I said where are we going?

823
00:59:43,248 --> 00:59:45,328
We're not looking for my mom,
are we?

824
00:59:45,848 --> 00:59:47,808
Be quiet!

825
00:59:48,808 --> 00:59:50,688
Let me think.

826
00:59:59,448 --> 01:00:01,408
Is your name Oh Eun-shil?

827
01:00:01,568 --> 01:00:02,488
Why?

828
01:00:03,008 --> 01:00:05,568
Your eyes are very pretty.

829
01:00:05,688 --> 01:00:07,368
Shut up.

830
01:00:20,928 --> 01:00:22,248
Why'd you cut your hair
so short?

831
01:00:22,368 --> 01:00:24,368
You'd look sexy with long hair.

832
01:00:25,088 --> 01:00:27,048
- Hey!
- Yes?

833
01:00:27,488 --> 01:00:29,528
- You want a beating?
- No.

834
01:00:38,008 --> 01:00:40,848
Just sit and
don't screw around.

835
01:00:48,968 --> 01:00:50,728
You're not wearing
any perfume.

836
01:00:51,528 --> 01:00:54,368
You must be on your period.
Smells fishy.

837
01:01:17,528 --> 01:01:18,928
Is this a call-girl massage parlor?

838
01:01:19,328 --> 01:01:20,368
Let me ask you something.

839
01:01:25,888 --> 01:01:26,888
What's up?

840
01:01:29,248 --> 01:01:31,408
We're in deep trouble.

841
01:01:31,528 --> 01:01:34,368
That asshole has done this
twice before.

842
01:01:34,488 --> 01:01:35,808
What are you talking about?

843
01:01:35,928 --> 01:01:37,808
The prosecutor called.

844
01:01:37,928 --> 01:01:40,608
Young-min said he killed
someone before.

845
01:01:40,728 --> 01:01:42,888
But he was freed since
there wasn't enough evidence.

846
01:01:43,008 --> 01:01:45,968
The prosecutor ordered him
to be freed.

847
01:01:46,088 --> 01:01:48,848
The chief is going to
have a fit.

848
01:01:48,968 --> 01:01:50,968
We're screwed.

849
01:01:53,008 --> 01:01:54,488
You want to die?

850
01:01:56,648 --> 01:01:58,248
Did you kill them or not?

851
01:02:00,128 --> 01:02:01,328
Answer me, you bastard!

852
01:02:01,448 --> 01:02:03,888
Young-min,
you told us everything before.

853
01:02:04,008 --> 01:02:05,608
What's wrong with you?

854
01:02:05,768 --> 01:02:07,168
Turn the camera.

855
01:02:09,968 --> 01:02:11,168
Let me ask you once more.

856
01:02:11,968 --> 01:02:13,408
Did you kill them or not?

857
01:02:15,048 --> 01:02:16,368
I'm sorry.

858
01:02:19,208 --> 01:02:20,888
Who the hell
do you think you are?

859
01:02:21,008 --> 01:02:23,088
You must think
we're some damn clowns.

860
01:02:28,808 --> 01:02:29,608
I checked.

861
01:02:29,728 --> 01:02:32,408
Noryangjin station's warrant
was rejected by the judge.

862
01:02:32,528 --> 01:02:34,008
Eunpyung station was like us.

863
01:02:34,168 --> 01:02:35,488
Both stations
had insufficient evidence.

864
01:02:35,608 --> 01:02:38,608
Screw them.
That asshole is the murderer.

865
01:02:39,208 --> 01:02:41,488
He can't make that kind of statement
if he hadn't killed them.

866
01:02:41,608 --> 01:02:42,928
That's right.

867
01:02:43,248 --> 01:02:45,208
So do you want to let him go?

868
01:02:46,608 --> 01:02:50,408
Or search that neighborhood
to find some evidence?

869
01:02:51,048 --> 01:02:52,048
Listen carefully.

870
01:02:52,168 --> 01:02:54,048
He said he buried
the victims,

871
01:02:54,208 --> 01:02:56,088
- Right?
- Yes, sir.

872
01:02:56,208 --> 01:02:58,488
It means he buried
the victims somewhere else.

873
01:02:58,608 --> 01:03:01,168
He couldn't have buried
all 12 bodies in his front yard.

874
01:03:01,688 --> 01:03:03,288
- In the mountain!
- Yes,

875
01:03:03,408 --> 01:03:04,888
but are there
many mountains there?

876
01:03:05,528 --> 01:03:06,368
No, sir.

877
01:03:06,488 --> 01:03:09,288
No, there is only one.
Sungmi Mountain.

878
01:03:09,408 --> 01:03:11,208
- Am I right?
- Yes, sir.

879
01:03:11,328 --> 01:03:12,848
Go search there.

880
01:03:12,968 --> 01:03:15,328
Find the dead bodies.

881
01:03:35,048 --> 01:03:36,288
Are you really a cop?

882
01:03:38,608 --> 01:03:40,368
Show me your badge.

883
01:03:40,768 --> 01:03:42,568
I can't believe this.

884
01:03:43,968 --> 01:03:45,648
You're not a cop, are you?

885
01:03:45,768 --> 01:03:48,728
Fuck.

886
01:03:48,968 --> 01:03:50,168
Fuck?

887
01:03:50,968 --> 01:03:54,568
Get lost.

888
01:04:06,808 --> 01:04:10,888
Repeat this number,
016-9265-4885.

889
01:04:12,648 --> 01:04:14,528
9265-4885...

890
01:04:14,648 --> 01:04:15,768
Find it.

891
01:04:19,928 --> 01:04:21,248
See if anyone's coming!

892
01:04:27,528 --> 01:04:28,608
Here.

893
01:04:31,168 --> 01:04:32,008
Hyun-ju

894
01:04:32,128 --> 01:04:33,248
Where is she?

895
01:04:33,368 --> 01:04:34,488
Not here.

896
01:04:35,688 --> 01:04:36,968
She disappeared on this day?

897
01:04:37,128 --> 01:04:38,208
Don't know.

898
01:04:38,568 --> 01:04:40,528
Not knowing doesn't resolve things,
you bastard.

899
01:04:40,648 --> 01:04:41,888
You didn't even look for her?

900
01:04:54,648 --> 01:04:55,768
Where's your dad?

901
01:04:56,368 --> 01:04:57,768
He's in Brazil

902
01:04:57,928 --> 01:04:58,928
Brazil?

903
01:05:01,448 --> 01:05:02,768
Where in Brazil?

904
01:05:02,888 --> 01:05:04,408
Rio de Janeiro.

905
01:05:04,528 --> 01:05:05,728
What?

906
01:05:06,248 --> 01:05:08,168
The old capital of Brazil.

907
01:05:10,008 --> 01:05:11,208
What's he doing there?

908
01:05:11,368 --> 01:05:12,928
Working.

909
01:05:17,848 --> 01:05:19,168
Have you seen your dad?

910
01:05:19,688 --> 01:05:20,688
No.

911
01:05:21,968 --> 01:05:23,768
Did you talk on
the phone with him?

912
01:05:27,848 --> 01:05:29,808
Damn.

913
01:05:32,328 --> 01:05:33,848
What a bitch.

914
01:05:33,968 --> 01:05:35,768
Better off saying Saudi Arabia.

915
01:05:41,088 --> 01:05:42,968
Eat up.

916
01:05:45,208 --> 01:05:46,888
What a damn temper.

917
01:06:04,648 --> 01:06:06,088
Are you okay?

918
01:06:06,688 --> 01:06:07,608
Yes.

919
01:06:07,728 --> 01:06:10,768
Damn it.

920
01:06:12,728 --> 01:06:14,128
Shit!

921
01:06:36,488 --> 01:06:40,288
I've found it.

922
01:06:41,688 --> 01:06:43,488
- Where?
- Right here.

923
01:06:44,008 --> 01:06:44,808
Hee-jeong

924
01:06:44,968 --> 01:06:45,968
Where is she now?

925
01:06:46,088 --> 01:06:47,888
- Yes?
- Where's Hee-jeong?

926
01:06:48,008 --> 01:06:49,328
She's gone, too?

927
01:06:49,768 --> 01:06:52,088
She went to a customer.

928
01:06:52,688 --> 01:06:54,488
He's a complete lunatic.

929
01:06:54,608 --> 01:06:56,128
So do you know
where he lives?

930
01:06:56,248 --> 01:06:57,568
No.

931
01:06:57,688 --> 01:06:58,528
Then where were you 2?

932
01:06:58,648 --> 01:07:00,128
Somewhere around here.

933
01:07:00,288 --> 01:07:03,208
Was there anything
strange about him?

934
01:07:03,368 --> 01:07:04,768
A lot.

935
01:07:05,088 --> 01:07:06,208
Tell me.

936
01:07:06,728 --> 01:07:10,048
His dick wouldn't get hard.

937
01:07:10,368 --> 01:07:12,928
Watch what
you say around the kid.

938
01:07:14,088 --> 01:07:15,048
I mean,

939
01:07:15,648 --> 01:07:18,968
his penis didn't get erect.

940
01:07:19,968 --> 01:07:20,968
So?

941
01:07:21,128 --> 01:07:23,168
No matter how hard I tried,
it wouldn't work.

942
01:07:23,328 --> 01:07:25,448
He said
he wasn't drunk, either.

943
01:07:26,168 --> 01:07:27,568
That meant he was impotent.

944
01:07:27,688 --> 01:07:29,888
Why'd an impotent bastard
call me then?

945
01:07:30,008 --> 01:07:30,848
Then what?

946
01:07:30,968 --> 01:07:32,288
What else?

947
01:07:32,408 --> 01:07:34,288
I treated him like a king
so that I can keep the money.

948
01:07:34,408 --> 01:07:38,048
Then he kept calling me,
asking me to live with him.

949
01:07:38,168 --> 01:07:40,128
I got aggravated
so I didn't answer.

950
01:07:40,568 --> 01:07:41,768
Then that crazy bastard

951
01:07:41,928 --> 01:07:44,368
started sending me
strange pictures.

952
01:07:45,448 --> 01:07:48,408
He was covered with blood
and said he'd kill me.

953
01:07:48,528 --> 01:07:52,248
He kept bothering me like that
for several days.

954
01:07:52,568 --> 01:07:53,768
Do you still have the pictures?

955
01:07:53,928 --> 01:07:56,528
Are you crazy?
I erased all of them.

956
01:07:58,408 --> 01:07:59,608
Okay.

957
01:08:00,328 --> 01:08:01,808
Did he do something?

958
01:08:02,728 --> 01:08:04,408
He killed someone, didn't he?

959
01:08:06,368 --> 01:08:07,968
Hey, mister!

960
01:08:09,048 --> 01:08:10,368
Mister!

961
01:08:11,728 --> 01:08:12,848
Hey...

962
01:09:43,328 --> 01:09:44,728
Don't go anywhere.

963
01:09:45,728 --> 01:09:47,128
- Where is it?
- Over here.

964
01:09:49,928 --> 01:09:51,048
Here.

965
01:10:12,968 --> 01:10:14,048
Are you sure this is it?

966
01:10:14,208 --> 01:10:15,808
Yes, look.

967
01:10:20,648 --> 01:10:22,408
Is this the wrong place?

968
01:10:26,488 --> 01:10:28,288
Tell me what's going on.

969
01:10:28,408 --> 01:10:29,608
Search some more
with the keys.

970
01:10:29,768 --> 01:10:30,568
Why?

971
01:10:30,728 --> 01:10:32,488
Mi-jin isn't here, idiot!

972
01:10:44,808 --> 01:10:46,288
Let's go.

973
01:10:54,288 --> 01:10:55,608
Meathead!

974
01:11:53,368 --> 01:11:55,168
- Where did he go?
- I don't know!

975
01:11:55,688 --> 01:11:56,688
You go over there.

976
01:12:11,848 --> 01:12:16,048
I told you I'd pay you back,
asshole!

977
01:12:17,528 --> 01:12:19,408
I have to live, too!

978
01:12:25,768 --> 01:12:27,968
Why'd he call me out
in such a hurry?

979
01:12:28,088 --> 01:12:29,688
It's a big headache.

980
01:12:29,808 --> 01:12:31,408
Damn it.

981
01:12:32,968 --> 01:12:34,688
- Eun-shil, go wash up.
- Okay.

982
01:12:40,168 --> 01:12:42,928
Did you laugh? Did you?

983
01:12:48,608 --> 01:12:51,528
Get up, asshole.
We have a guest.

984
01:12:54,088 --> 01:12:56,928
Son of a bitch.

985
01:12:57,448 --> 01:12:59,408
Wake me up if anyone comes.

986
01:13:07,048 --> 01:13:08,528
Where is Kim Mi-jin?

987
01:13:08,648 --> 01:13:10,368
I don't know who she is.

988
01:13:11,848 --> 01:13:13,608
Where is she?

989
01:13:13,768 --> 01:13:16,568
Where is she? Answer me!

990
01:13:18,248 --> 01:13:19,528
Spare me.

991
01:13:21,968 --> 01:13:23,368
Where is she?

992
01:13:23,528 --> 01:13:26,048
I really don't know.
Spare me.

993
01:13:44,168 --> 01:13:46,208
We shared
the same prison cell.

994
01:13:46,848 --> 01:13:48,688
He visited me 4 months ago.

995
01:13:48,808 --> 01:13:52,528
He needed a place to stay
for 2 weeks.

996
01:13:53,528 --> 01:13:56,168
I haven't seen him
since then.

997
01:13:56,688 --> 01:13:59,928
Oh yeah, I saw him once.

998
01:14:00,048 --> 01:14:03,688
He came in and took his bag
while I was asleep.

999
01:14:03,808 --> 01:14:04,728
What sort of bag?

1000
01:14:13,608 --> 01:14:16,328
A large black bag.

1001
01:14:16,768 --> 01:14:18,568
It had all kinds of tools in it.

1002
01:14:18,688 --> 01:14:19,568
What tools?

1003
01:14:19,688 --> 01:14:21,968
Just tools.

1004
01:14:22,688 --> 01:14:25,048
Like a chisel,
hammer and saw.

1005
01:14:25,168 --> 01:14:26,688
Did he say
where he was going?

1006
01:14:27,088 --> 01:14:28,128
No.

1007
01:14:49,848 --> 01:14:51,128
Who painted all this?

1008
01:14:51,248 --> 01:14:52,768
He did.

1009
01:14:54,128 --> 01:14:55,168
No.

1010
01:14:56,808 --> 01:14:58,408
Then what about a girlfriend?

1011
01:14:58,568 --> 01:14:59,568
No.

1012
01:15:01,728 --> 01:15:05,808
Have you ever had
a girlfriend?

1013
01:15:05,928 --> 01:15:06,888
Yes.

1014
01:15:07,368 --> 01:15:09,928
How long was
your relationship?

1015
01:15:12,008 --> 01:15:13,208
About a year.

1016
01:15:13,808 --> 01:15:18,488
Then you must've had
sex with her.

1017
01:15:20,808 --> 01:15:23,928
Why? Are you embarrassed?

1018
01:15:24,728 --> 01:15:27,288
Just tell me.

1019
01:15:28,568 --> 01:15:32,168
Have you ever had sex
with your girlfriend?

1020
01:15:33,928 --> 01:15:35,728
Mr. Ji.

1021
01:15:37,008 --> 01:15:40,128
Have you ever had sex
with a woman?

1022
01:15:40,648 --> 01:15:42,368
Why do you want to know?

1023
01:15:43,848 --> 01:15:46,568
Don't answer
if you don't want to.

1024
01:15:47,208 --> 01:15:49,648
I'll ask something else.
At your house...

1025
01:15:49,768 --> 01:15:51,768
I asked you.
Why you do you want to know?

1026
01:15:54,408 --> 01:15:57,128
I thought that
you might be impotent.

1027
01:15:57,248 --> 01:15:59,688
How would you know?
Have you seen it?

1028
01:16:03,288 --> 01:16:05,848
Because assholes like you
mostly are.

1029
01:16:12,888 --> 01:16:14,088
You're impotent, aren't you?

1030
01:16:15,488 --> 01:16:16,888
When you see a woman,

1031
01:16:17,008 --> 01:16:20,048
you want to have sex
but you can't.

1032
01:16:20,368 --> 01:16:23,688
So you kill them
with a chisel, right?

1033
01:16:25,088 --> 01:16:27,968
You think
the chisel is your penis.

1034
01:16:28,128 --> 01:16:32,328
The pleasure from hammering
the chisel on a woman's head.

1035
01:16:32,448 --> 01:16:33,088
Stop it.

1036
01:16:33,208 --> 01:16:35,568
You killed young women
because of that pleasure.

1037
01:16:35,688 --> 01:16:38,448
Stop it. That's not it.

1038
01:16:40,688 --> 01:16:42,688
That's not why.

1039
01:16:48,008 --> 01:16:49,208
Are you curious?

1040
01:16:50,488 --> 01:16:51,808
I'll tell you.

1041
01:16:52,488 --> 01:16:53,728
Why'd you kill them?

1042
01:17:01,888 --> 01:17:03,968
Come here.
I'll tell you why.

1043
01:17:05,248 --> 01:17:06,368
Come over here.

1044
01:17:11,688 --> 01:17:13,728
- Just sit down.
- I'll tell you.

1045
01:17:14,088 --> 01:17:15,488
Go sit down, you bastard.

1046
01:17:17,328 --> 01:17:18,528
Sit.

1047
01:17:34,488 --> 01:17:37,048
I'm right, aren't I?

1048
01:17:37,168 --> 01:17:40,688
You want to have sex,
but your body can't.

1049
01:17:40,808 --> 01:17:42,248
So the women...

1050
01:17:43,408 --> 01:17:44,928
- What do you know?
- Let go!

1051
01:17:45,048 --> 01:17:46,648
What do you know?

1052
01:17:47,168 --> 01:17:48,488
Stop it!

1053
01:17:49,848 --> 01:17:54,608
Why do you keep
bothering me? Why?

1054
01:17:56,008 --> 01:17:56,928
Bravo.

1055
01:18:40,168 --> 01:18:41,128
Hey, where's the kid?

1056
01:18:41,248 --> 01:18:42,928
What?

1057
01:18:43,048 --> 01:18:44,288
Where's the kid?

1058
01:18:44,408 --> 01:18:46,208
- What?
- You dumb ass.

1059
01:18:57,928 --> 01:18:59,528
Go that way, idiot!

1060
01:19:41,568 --> 01:19:43,368
Over here! Hurry!

1061
01:19:43,488 --> 01:19:45,288
- Hurry!
- This way!

1062
01:20:02,688 --> 01:20:04,168
Are you her father?

1063
01:20:04,328 --> 01:20:06,568
You didn't sign here.

1064
01:20:41,808 --> 01:20:42,888
From now on,
we're searching

1065
01:20:43,048 --> 01:20:45,008
Mangwon to find
Ji Young-min's place.

1066
01:20:45,128 --> 01:20:48,088
The residents will be awake,
and we'll have more backup.

1067
01:20:48,208 --> 01:20:51,248
We have no warrant and
no approval, so by 12,

1068
01:20:51,368 --> 01:20:54,688
bring back any evidence,
if you need to fake it, got it?

1069
01:20:54,848 --> 01:20:55,968
Yes, sir.

1070
01:20:56,088 --> 01:20:59,328
You call that a response,
you bastards?

1071
01:20:59,448 --> 01:21:00,648
Yes, sir!

1072
01:21:14,048 --> 01:21:16,848
Tell me where it is!

1073
01:21:16,968 --> 01:21:18,408
Where is it?

1074
01:21:21,288 --> 01:21:23,088
Answer me, you asshole!

1075
01:21:25,928 --> 01:21:27,128
Tell me!

1076
01:21:27,248 --> 01:21:29,128
Where is it? Where is it?

1077
01:21:29,928 --> 01:21:32,688
Answer me,
you son of a bitch!

1078
01:21:33,888 --> 01:21:34,888
What's the matter?

1079
01:21:37,808 --> 01:21:38,728
What is it?

1080
01:21:51,208 --> 01:21:52,448
Go inside.

1081
01:21:53,048 --> 01:21:55,328
What happened?

1082
01:21:55,448 --> 01:21:56,648
What did he say?

1083
01:21:58,248 --> 01:22:00,608
He confessed.
Mangwon, 893-1.

1084
01:22:23,368 --> 01:22:25,608
- Move your ass!
- Get in there fast!

1085
01:22:26,328 --> 01:22:28,488
Dig deep all around, got it?

1086
01:22:28,648 --> 01:22:29,448
Yes, sir.

1087
01:22:29,608 --> 01:22:30,888
Run inside!

1088
01:22:33,128 --> 01:22:35,048
Hurry up!

1089
01:22:35,848 --> 01:22:38,008
Dig inside!

1090
01:22:38,128 --> 01:22:39,528
You bastard!

1091
01:22:39,688 --> 01:22:40,968
Where were you?

1092
01:22:41,128 --> 01:22:43,848
You can't dig
with a walkie-talkie, idiot!

1093
01:22:46,088 --> 01:22:48,008
Come over here.
There's something strange here.

1094
01:22:50,568 --> 01:22:53,048
Not there, come over here.
There's something strange.

1095
01:22:53,168 --> 01:22:54,208
Yeah?

1096
01:22:55,568 --> 01:22:57,568
Hey, hang it over there.

1097
01:22:57,688 --> 01:22:58,608
Yes, sir.

1098
01:23:01,928 --> 01:23:02,728
Is there anything?

1099
01:23:02,888 --> 01:23:05,128
Look, isn't this blood?

1100
01:23:05,288 --> 01:23:08,208
Not blood.
It looks like hot sauce.

1101
01:23:09,888 --> 01:23:11,088
It is hot sauce.

1102
01:23:11,528 --> 01:23:12,808
Asshole.

1103
01:23:14,008 --> 01:23:16,168
That means he's worked here
up until 6 months ago.

1104
01:23:16,328 --> 01:23:16,848
Yes.

1105
01:23:16,968 --> 01:23:18,288
And you didn't know
when he came and went?

1106
01:23:18,408 --> 01:23:22,848
How would I know
if he sneaked in here at night?

1107
01:23:23,008 --> 01:23:24,608
Do you know
how many people he's killed?

1108
01:23:24,728 --> 01:23:26,528
Shit, this is crazy.

1109
01:23:26,648 --> 01:23:28,328
I really don't know anything!

1110
01:23:28,488 --> 01:23:30,448
- Don't yell at me.
- It's not here.

1111
01:23:31,368 --> 01:23:32,568
Get out.

1112
01:23:33,288 --> 01:23:35,448
- If we find...
- Mi-jin isn't here.

1113
01:23:36,648 --> 01:23:39,768
We're right here.

1114
01:23:40,168 --> 01:23:41,768
Her car is parked here.

1115
01:23:42,088 --> 01:23:43,408
This doesn't make sense.

1116
01:23:44,608 --> 01:23:45,808
Why doesn't it?

1117
01:23:45,928 --> 01:23:48,888
It's more than a 20-minute walk
from her car to here.

1118
01:23:49,688 --> 01:23:50,528
It's here.

1119
01:23:50,648 --> 01:23:51,848
5 minutes away.

1120
01:23:52,368 --> 01:23:53,408
Let's search there.

1121
01:23:53,528 --> 01:23:55,288
With the men we have,
we can finish quickly.

1122
01:23:55,408 --> 01:23:57,208
He told us
he buried them here!

1123
01:23:57,328 --> 01:23:59,488
That asshole is talking bullshit!

1124
01:24:01,568 --> 01:24:03,248
You bastard.

1125
01:24:03,968 --> 01:24:06,528
What's with you?
Is it because of the money?

1126
01:24:07,888 --> 01:24:09,768
When will you get
your act straight?

1127
01:24:10,488 --> 01:24:12,288
I don't believe this.

1128
01:24:12,408 --> 01:24:15,448
Ji Young-min is on his way now.
Let's talk when he comes.

1129
01:24:17,208 --> 01:24:18,808
Why do you move so slowly?

1130
01:24:18,928 --> 01:24:20,048
I'm sorry, sir.

1131
01:24:20,368 --> 01:24:21,408
Hey!

1132
01:24:22,088 --> 01:24:23,328
I told you to cover his face.

1133
01:24:23,448 --> 01:24:25,528
- Sorry, sir.
- Get the mask.

1134
01:24:25,648 --> 01:24:27,128
Morons.

1135
01:24:27,848 --> 01:24:29,408
Get moving!
Put him in the car!

1136
01:24:29,568 --> 01:24:30,968
Yes, sir.

1137
01:24:31,848 --> 01:24:34,328
Move your asses, will you?

1138
01:24:34,928 --> 01:24:37,288
You seem busy.

1139
01:24:43,208 --> 01:24:46,808
Ji Young-min, you should say hi
if you had seen me.

1140
01:24:50,288 --> 01:24:52,648
Take off your cap.

1141
01:24:57,128 --> 01:24:59,048
Damn it, you ignorant cops.

1142
01:25:01,208 --> 01:25:02,528
Have you lost your mind?

1143
01:25:05,328 --> 01:25:08,928
Suspect of the Mapo murder case
was arrested.

1144
01:25:09,448 --> 01:25:12,768
It's pitiful, isn't it?

1145
01:25:14,568 --> 01:25:15,848
I understand.

1146
01:25:16,168 --> 01:25:20,448
Shit splashes on the mayor's face.
You must be scared to death.

1147
01:25:20,608 --> 01:25:24,608
Set Young-min free this instant,
and bring your men back.

1148
01:25:25,128 --> 01:25:27,768
How about we do this?
The DNA results will be out soon.

1149
01:25:27,888 --> 01:25:31,688
If people find out about this,
how would they react?

1150
01:25:32,968 --> 01:25:35,688
A cop who got shit
on the mayor's face

1151
01:25:35,848 --> 01:25:39,248
forced an innocent citizen
to be a serial killer to save face.

1152
01:25:40,168 --> 01:25:43,768
But that citizen's face
was pulverized.

1153
01:25:46,288 --> 01:25:49,808
Stop what you're doing and tell me
who did that to Young-min.

1154
01:25:49,928 --> 01:25:51,648
Drag him down here now.

1155
01:25:51,768 --> 01:25:53,368
I'll do everything
to get him fired.

1156
01:25:53,768 --> 01:25:55,848
What the hell's wrong with you?

1157
01:25:56,008 --> 01:25:57,408
- Jung-ho!
- Let go.

1158
01:25:57,528 --> 01:25:59,328
Jung-ho, come here!

1159
01:25:59,448 --> 01:26:02,368
He's calling me, idiot!

1160
01:26:02,488 --> 01:26:04,448
He's calling me, asshole.
You better watch it!

1161
01:26:08,928 --> 01:26:11,288
You have to hurry and go.

1162
01:26:11,408 --> 01:26:12,728
Where to?

1163
01:26:13,328 --> 01:26:14,368
Stay still, asshole.

1164
01:26:14,488 --> 01:26:15,488
Bastard.

1165
01:26:15,648 --> 01:26:17,328
Hurry and catch him!

1166
01:26:17,448 --> 01:26:20,888
Are you out of your minds?

1167
01:26:22,848 --> 01:26:25,608
Why?

1168
01:26:25,728 --> 01:26:26,648
What's with this?

1169
01:26:26,768 --> 01:26:27,688
What?

1170
01:26:27,848 --> 01:26:29,048
Jung-ho!

1171
01:26:29,168 --> 01:26:30,088
What's going on?

1172
01:26:30,248 --> 01:26:31,808
The chief said to bring you in!

1173
01:26:31,968 --> 01:26:34,128
So why'd you hit him, idiot?

1174
01:26:34,888 --> 01:26:37,368
Go away!
I'll chop you down!

1175
01:26:37,488 --> 01:26:38,608
It's all over!

1176
01:26:38,728 --> 01:26:40,728
We have to give up the case
and set Young-min free!

1177
01:26:40,848 --> 01:26:43,008
Why? Are you crazy?

1178
01:26:43,168 --> 01:26:45,528
We don't have any power!
The prosecutor told us to!

1179
01:26:45,768 --> 01:26:48,288
If he goes out,
what about Mi-jin?

1180
01:26:48,448 --> 01:26:51,848
She's dead.
She died a long time ago!

1181
01:26:52,008 --> 01:26:54,048
So put that down now!

1182
01:26:54,208 --> 01:26:56,488
Why would she die,
you asshole?

1183
01:26:58,728 --> 01:27:00,768
Grab that bastard!

1184
01:27:01,408 --> 01:27:03,088
Catch him! Run faster!

1185
01:27:05,128 --> 01:27:06,608
Over there!

1186
01:27:08,008 --> 01:27:09,488
That way! Hurry!

1187
01:27:12,808 --> 01:27:15,168
- Catch him!
- Run fast!

1188
01:27:15,688 --> 01:27:17,928
Bastards!

1189
01:27:18,568 --> 01:27:21,208
Catch him!

1190
01:27:23,368 --> 01:27:25,408
Stay still, you bastard!

1191
01:27:25,568 --> 01:27:26,688
- Make him not move!
- You sons of bitches!

1192
01:27:26,808 --> 01:27:28,768
Hey! You sons of bitches!

1193
01:27:29,688 --> 01:27:31,488
Let go!

1194
01:27:34,968 --> 01:27:36,568
Open the door!

1195
01:27:36,688 --> 01:27:38,088
Get in!

1196
01:27:38,968 --> 01:27:41,408
Get in there!

1197
01:28:08,328 --> 01:28:10,568
Why didn't you just kill me
with the hoe?

1198
01:28:10,728 --> 01:28:12,408
That's enough.

1199
01:28:14,648 --> 01:28:16,248
Give me a cigarette.

1200
01:28:18,088 --> 01:28:20,768
Ji-man, give me a cigarette.

1201
01:28:20,888 --> 01:28:22,288
Damn it.

1202
01:28:22,888 --> 01:28:24,208
Give it.

1203
01:28:31,248 --> 01:28:32,448
Give me a lighter.

1204
01:28:34,608 --> 01:28:38,128
Kyung-suk,
still working back door?

1205
01:28:38,928 --> 01:28:43,088
Buy your mom some good food
after ripping off businesses?

1206
01:28:43,208 --> 01:28:46,528
It's you who's made big money,
you bastard.

1207
01:28:46,968 --> 01:28:49,328
Kyung-suk and I
made some money back then.

1208
01:28:49,448 --> 01:28:51,648
Shit, but I was the
only one who got fired.

1209
01:28:54,848 --> 01:28:56,328
Isn't that right?

1210
01:28:57,128 --> 01:29:01,128
Is your wallet full
from sucking that pig's ass?

1211
01:29:01,288 --> 01:29:03,328
- Does your mother know that?
- What the...

1212
01:29:31,088 --> 01:29:32,488
Give me the key.

1213
01:29:33,688 --> 01:29:35,008
Hurry.

1214
01:29:36,568 --> 01:29:38,168
Where's Ji Young-min?

1215
01:29:38,488 --> 01:29:39,808
He's probably out now.

1216
01:29:40,608 --> 01:29:42,088
Shit.

1217
01:31:24,328 --> 01:31:25,928
Taxi! Taxi!

1218
01:32:31,208 --> 01:32:32,968
Anybody here?

1219
01:32:33,408 --> 01:32:35,168
Anybody here?

1220
01:32:35,328 --> 01:32:36,448
Yes?

1221
01:32:37,248 --> 01:32:39,128
- Oh, my goodness!
- Call the police!

1222
01:32:39,248 --> 01:32:40,448
Hurry!

1223
01:33:41,888 --> 01:33:43,288
Ma'am.

1224
01:33:43,408 --> 01:33:44,328
Ma'am!

1225
01:33:44,488 --> 01:33:45,568
Yes.

1226
01:33:46,488 --> 01:33:47,608
Oh, hello.

1227
01:33:47,728 --> 01:33:49,048
- Cigarettes?
- Yes.

1228
01:33:51,208 --> 01:33:54,208
What happened to your face?

1229
01:33:54,368 --> 01:33:55,488
It was some lunatic.

1230
01:33:55,608 --> 01:33:58,648
Why are there so many lunatics
in this neighborhood?

1231
01:34:00,688 --> 01:34:01,888
What's wrong?

1232
01:34:02,008 --> 01:34:03,328
I'm scared to death.

1233
01:34:03,448 --> 01:34:04,648
Stay with us for a while.

1234
01:34:04,808 --> 01:34:06,008
- Why?
- Well,

1235
01:34:06,128 --> 01:34:09,648
some lunatic locked up a girl
and tried to kill her.

1236
01:34:10,448 --> 01:34:11,568
Is that so?

1237
01:34:12,168 --> 01:34:15,048
Maybe it's the same guy
who hit you.

1238
01:34:16,408 --> 01:34:17,408
Have a nice day.

1239
01:34:17,568 --> 01:34:19,248
Just stay here a little longer!

1240
01:34:19,568 --> 01:34:22,408
- Why?
- What if that lunatic comes here?

1241
01:34:23,208 --> 01:34:24,808
Why would he come here?

1242
01:34:25,808 --> 01:34:27,808
That girl is here.

1243
01:34:33,768 --> 01:34:36,408
Just wait here
until the police arrive.

1244
01:34:36,528 --> 01:34:38,608
Help yourself to any drinks.

1245
01:34:43,648 --> 01:34:45,528
What's taking the police
so long?

1246
01:34:49,208 --> 01:34:50,408
When did you report it?

1247
01:34:50,568 --> 01:34:52,048
It's been quite a while.

1248
01:35:01,768 --> 01:35:03,088
Why aren't they coming?

1249
01:35:04,288 --> 01:35:05,928
- Ma'am.
- Yes?

1250
01:35:06,728 --> 01:35:09,008
Do you happen to have
a hammer or a club?

1251
01:35:09,128 --> 01:35:10,248
Why?

1252
01:35:10,408 --> 01:35:13,248
Well, I don't have a club.

1253
01:35:13,368 --> 01:35:14,848
Here's a hammer.

1254
01:35:19,128 --> 01:35:22,448
Seeing you stand there like that
makes me feel safe.

1255
01:35:32,648 --> 01:35:34,848
Just stand there like that,

1256
01:35:34,968 --> 01:35:38,728
and when that lunatic comes,
pound his face, okay?

1257
01:36:52,728 --> 01:36:54,048
Hey.

1258
01:36:54,928 --> 01:36:56,048
Wake up.

1259
01:36:56,168 --> 01:36:57,288
Hey.

1260
01:37:01,568 --> 01:37:03,448
You're really unbelievable.

1261
01:37:08,648 --> 01:37:10,088
How did you get out?

1262
01:37:12,128 --> 01:37:13,528
How did you get out?

1263
01:37:21,888 --> 01:37:23,648
Damn it.

1264
01:39:15,848 --> 01:39:19,928
What happened?

1265
01:39:27,608 --> 01:39:29,768
Gil-woo! Gil-woo!

1266
01:39:29,928 --> 01:39:31,328
Gil-woo! Gil-woo!

1267
01:39:36,528 --> 01:39:37,928
Mi-jin!

1268
01:39:42,088 --> 01:39:43,128
Mi-jin...

1269
01:39:48,248 --> 01:39:50,328
Gil-woo... Gil-woo!

1270
01:39:51,408 --> 01:39:52,808
- You have to leave.
- Stop.

1271
01:39:52,968 --> 01:39:54,128
Don't push!

1272
01:39:56,968 --> 01:39:58,048
Hey!

1273
01:40:00,688 --> 01:40:02,488
Hey!

1274
01:40:05,208 --> 01:40:06,408
Hey!

1275
01:40:07,048 --> 01:40:08,528
Hey!

1276
01:40:09,608 --> 01:40:10,728
Gil-woo!

1277
01:41:16,768 --> 01:41:17,968
Look after the kid.

1278
01:41:51,008 --> 01:41:52,688
He sent me
a strange text message.

1279
01:41:52,808 --> 01:41:53,848
He covered his body
with blood.

1280
01:41:53,968 --> 01:41:55,568
Hurry and tell me.

1281
01:41:55,688 --> 01:41:56,808
Right there.

1282
01:41:59,368 --> 01:42:00,448
What about
the telecom company?

1283
01:42:00,888 --> 01:42:02,648
No judge's approval
on Sunday.

1284
01:42:02,768 --> 01:42:04,648
Tell him to issue it
before I kill someone!

1285
01:42:04,808 --> 01:42:06,008
What bastard was it?

1286
01:42:06,528 --> 01:42:08,208
Who spilled the beans?

1287
01:42:08,528 --> 01:42:10,048
I told you to watch your mouth!

1288
01:42:31,688 --> 01:42:33,248
Jung-ho.

1289
01:42:34,128 --> 01:42:35,528
Jung-ho, it's me.

1290
01:42:36,528 --> 01:42:38,528
You're not answering
your phone.

1291
01:42:39,608 --> 01:42:41,688
Don't get mad and
listen to me.

1292
01:42:44,008 --> 01:42:46,008
I want to quit.

1293
01:42:48,048 --> 01:42:50,128
I really can't take it.

1294
01:42:51,128 --> 01:42:55,208
I'm too scared to do this job.

1295
01:43:49,328 --> 01:43:50,848
Mangwon church

1296
01:44:12,648 --> 01:44:15,488
Here doggie, doggie.

1297
01:44:16,008 --> 01:44:18,528
Here you are.

1298
01:44:52,928 --> 01:44:54,128
May I help you?

1299
01:45:01,368 --> 01:45:03,928
Do you know him?

1300
01:45:27,648 --> 01:45:29,408
Mr. Park Dong-won.

1301
01:45:29,568 --> 01:45:31,528
He worked in construction.

1302
01:45:32,168 --> 01:45:35,288
He helped to expand
the church recently.

1303
01:45:35,808 --> 01:45:37,288
I saw him then.

1304
01:45:38,288 --> 01:45:40,568
He made that cross.

1305
01:45:41,368 --> 01:45:43,448
He's very talented.

1306
01:45:44,528 --> 01:45:47,448
PARK Dong-won
If you ask Mr. Park,
he may know him.

1307
01:46:05,248 --> 01:46:06,448
Mangwon district, 24-1

1308
01:47:12,088 --> 01:47:13,088
Where are you going?

1309
01:47:16,328 --> 01:47:17,528
Let's go inside.

1310
01:52:07,568 --> 01:52:08,768
Where is he?

1311
01:52:09,168 --> 01:52:10,288
Here!

1312
01:52:10,408 --> 01:52:11,528
Freeze!

1313
01:52:18,768 --> 01:52:22,088
You bastard,
what are you doing?

1314
01:52:26,368 --> 01:52:29,288
Jung-ho, put it down.

1315
01:52:33,448 --> 01:52:37,448
Jung-ho, that's enough.

1316
01:53:57,448 --> 01:53:59,368
Get it right over there!

1317
01:54:45,128 --> 01:54:46,568
Where are all the reporters?
