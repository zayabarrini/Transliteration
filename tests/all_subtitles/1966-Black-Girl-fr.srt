00:01:49,297 --> 00:01:53,551
From a Short Story by...

5
00:02:52,026 --> 00:02:54,487
<i>Has anyone come for me?</i>

6
00:03:29,647 --> 00:03:31,899
You made it all right? Let's go.

7
00:04:01,804 --> 00:04:03,806
Did you have a nice trip?

8
00:04:19,947 --> 00:04:21,782
Lovely country, France.

9
00:04:22,074 --> 00:04:23,617
Yes, sir.

10
00:05:22,676 --> 00:05:24,637
Here we are at last.

11
00:05:44,573 --> 00:05:46,283
<i>Is that you?</i>

12
00:05:48,827 --> 00:05:50,371
Hello, Diouana.

13
00:05:56,418 --> 00:05:58,504
I hope you'll like it here.

14
00:05:58,712 --> 00:06:01,882
I'll show you your room.

15
00:06:09,390 --> 00:06:10,975
Here's your bed.

16
00:06:12,518 --> 00:06:16,313
And that's the Riviera.

17
00:06:17,731 --> 00:06:19,984
Juan-les-Pins,
Nice...

18
00:06:21,110 --> 00:06:22,653
Cannes...

19
00:06:23,112 --> 00:06:24,905
and Antibes.

20
00:06:28,534 --> 00:06:30,911
I'll show you the kitchen.

21
00:07:43,984 --> 00:07:46,654
<i>Kitchen, bathroom...</i>

22
00:07:47,071 --> 00:07:49,114
<i>bedroom...</i>

23
00:07:49,239 --> 00:07:50,407
<i>living room.</i>

24
00:07:50,532 --> 00:07:52,493
<i>That's all I ever see.</i>

25
00:07:52,660 --> 00:07:55,371
<i>This isn't what I
came to France for.</i>

26
00:07:57,915 --> 00:08:00,167
<i>What are the people here like?</i>

27
00:08:00,292 --> 00:08:02,836
<i>The doors are all
shut, day and night...</i>

28
00:08:03,295 --> 00:08:05,214
<i>night and day.</i>

29
00:08:05,964 --> 00:08:08,634
<i>I came to take care
of the children.</i>

30
00:08:09,093 --> 00:08:10,844
<i>Where are they?</i>

31
00:08:10,969 --> 00:08:13,722
<i>Why is Madame always
shouting at me?</i>

32
00:08:14,014 --> 00:08:17,309
<i>I'm not a cook or a cleaning woman.</i>

33
00:08:47,214 --> 00:08:49,133
You're not going to a party.

34
00:08:49,258 --> 00:08:52,928
You've dressed like that for
weeks. Put on something else!

35
00:08:59,226 --> 00:09:01,562
I bought this apron for you.

36
00:09:04,398 --> 00:09:05,816
Let's see.

37
00:09:13,198 --> 00:09:14,742
Turn around.

38
00:09:15,576 --> 00:09:17,911
We're having guests for lunch.

39
00:09:18,078 --> 00:09:20,873
Fix a nice rice with peanut sauce.

40
00:09:36,722 --> 00:09:38,390
<i>Why this apron?</i>

41
00:09:38,807 --> 00:09:40,768
<i>What am I here?</i>

42
00:09:41,185 --> 00:09:43,187
<i>I've never been a cook.</i>

43
00:09:44,021 --> 00:09:46,523
<i>Why does Madame want rice?</i>

44
00:09:47,107 --> 00:09:51,111
<i>Her cook in Dakar never fixed rice.</i>

45
00:09:52,696 --> 00:09:56,241
<i>Maybe the rice in
Dakar is different.</i>

46
00:09:58,327 --> 00:10:02,247
<i>I came here for the
children. Where are they?</i>

47
00:10:02,956 --> 00:10:06,960
<i>Why did Madame bring me
here if they aren't with her?</i>

48
00:10:16,136 --> 00:10:19,890
<i>After I make this rice, maybe
they'll show me the city.</i>

49
00:10:20,682 --> 00:10:22,726
<i>Maybe we'll go to Cannes...</i>

50
00:10:23,143 --> 00:10:25,521
<i>Nice, Monte Carlo.</i>

51
00:10:26,355 --> 00:10:29,316
<i>We'll look at all
the pretty stores,</i>

52
00:10:29,983 --> 00:10:32,236
<i>and when Madame pays me,</i>

53
00:10:32,361 --> 00:10:34,446
<i>I'll buy pretty dresses...</i>

54
00:10:34,571 --> 00:10:36,073
<i>shoes...</i>

55
00:10:36,198 --> 00:10:37,783
<i>silk undies...</i>

56
00:10:37,991 --> 00:10:39,827
<i>and pretty wigs.</i>

57
00:10:40,619 --> 00:10:43,497
<i>I'll have my picture
taken on the beach...</i>

58
00:10:44,122 --> 00:10:46,583
<i>and send it back to Dakar...</i>

59
00:10:46,708 --> 00:10:48,961
<i>where everyone will
be green with envy!</i>

60
00:10:49,670 --> 00:10:51,672
<i>I hope they like my rice.</i>

61
00:10:51,922 --> 00:10:53,799
<i>My sauce isn't too spicy.</i>

62
00:10:54,883 --> 00:10:56,969
<i>What if the children don't come?</i>

63
00:10:57,094 --> 00:11:00,931
- I'm dying to taste it.
- It's good but very spicy.

64
00:11:04,560 --> 00:11:07,521
Genuine African cooking
prepared by the maid!

65
00:11:09,690 --> 00:11:12,109
Would you pass the rice?

66
00:11:13,235 --> 00:11:14,862
You like it?

67
00:11:15,028 --> 00:11:17,155
It's very good.

68
00:11:17,281 --> 00:11:20,534
- Very spicy.
- Good. I like spicy food.

69
00:11:25,873 --> 00:11:27,541
A plate of rice, and wine.

70
00:11:31,461 --> 00:11:34,506
<i>These people eat like
pigs and jabber away!</i>

71
00:11:36,174 --> 00:11:38,176
<i>And do they ever drink!</i>

72
00:11:38,552 --> 00:11:40,220
A little sauce, please.

73
00:11:42,014 --> 00:11:43,682
It's good.

74
00:11:44,641 --> 00:11:46,643
A bit more.

75
00:11:47,227 --> 00:11:49,146
You must come to Dakar.

76
00:11:49,313 --> 00:11:52,482
Africa isn't safe now.
All those coups d'état.

77
00:11:52,608 --> 00:11:54,401
Senegal is safe.

78
00:11:54,568 --> 00:11:57,362
It's very good, but a bit rich.

79
00:11:57,487 --> 00:12:00,157
And nicely prepared.
Your cook's a gem.

80
00:12:00,616 --> 00:12:03,243
Africans only eat rice.

81
00:12:03,368 --> 00:12:05,871
- What's in the sauce?
- Is it fattening?

82
00:12:05,996 --> 00:12:07,998
I hope it's an aphrodisiac.

83
00:12:10,042 --> 00:12:11,919
Always kidding around!

84
00:12:12,711 --> 00:12:14,421
Thank you, Diouana.

85
00:12:17,174 --> 00:12:18,967
Do you mind, miss?

86
00:12:19,259 --> 00:12:21,219
I've never kissed a black woman.

87
00:12:22,721 --> 00:12:25,515
She doesn't look too happy.

88
00:12:36,818 --> 00:12:40,697
With independence, the natives
have lost a natural quality.

89
00:12:42,240 --> 00:12:44,242
He was just kidding around.

90
00:12:44,368 --> 00:12:46,453
The rice was very
good. I'm pleased.

91
00:12:49,081 --> 00:12:50,791
Fix some nice coffee.

92
00:12:56,338 --> 00:12:58,090
<i>Put that down.</i>

93
00:13:01,385 --> 00:13:03,095
Come over here.

94
00:13:04,805 --> 00:13:07,265
PUBLIC SCRIBE

95
00:13:10,686 --> 00:13:12,270
Where are you going?

96
00:13:12,813 --> 00:13:14,523
To look for work.

97
00:13:17,567 --> 00:13:20,237
<i>It all began that morning...</i>

98
00:13:20,654 --> 00:13:22,447
<i>in Dakar.</i>

99
00:13:37,379 --> 00:13:39,548
<i>I'd gone up and down,</i>

100
00:13:39,756 --> 00:13:42,592
<i>from one floor to the next,</i>

101
00:13:43,010 --> 00:13:45,512
<i>but it was the same all over:</i>

102
00:13:45,679 --> 00:13:47,848
<i>No one wanted a maid.</i>

103
00:14:00,068 --> 00:14:02,863
- Think of the future.
- The future looks dark!

104
00:14:02,988 --> 00:14:05,157
Don't exaggerate!

105
00:14:05,282 --> 00:14:08,285
- A man can't have opinions anymore!
- But that's obstruction!

106
00:14:08,410 --> 00:14:11,538
That's what you say!
It's in your interest.

107
00:14:11,705 --> 00:14:14,708
- In your district - -
I'm elected by the people!

108
00:14:14,875 --> 00:14:16,960
- Not so loud!
- I say no!

109
00:14:17,085 --> 00:14:18,712
Think of your children.

110
00:14:18,879 --> 00:14:22,049
He's right. You have
to ease up a bit.

111
00:14:38,398 --> 00:14:40,108
Excuse me, miss.

112
00:15:18,438 --> 00:15:20,607
I don't want any!

113
00:15:45,382 --> 00:15:49,136
<i>He walked right up to
me and just kept staring.</i>

114
00:15:49,594 --> 00:15:51,471
<i>My mind was elsewhere.</i>

115
00:15:52,097 --> 00:15:53,807
<i>I had to find work.</i>

116
00:15:54,891 --> 00:15:57,561
<i>The street was empty
except for two women.</i>

117
00:15:58,186 --> 00:16:01,439
<i>They were beautiful.
I watched them go by.</i>

118
00:16:09,865 --> 00:16:12,742
<i>But he just kept talking.</i>

119
00:16:15,495 --> 00:16:19,916
<i>He told me about “the maids'
square” where I might find work.</i>

120
00:16:23,211 --> 00:16:25,964
<i>When we got there, he left.</i>

121
00:16:27,507 --> 00:16:29,676
<i>I promised to see him again</i>

122
00:16:29,885 --> 00:16:33,513
<i>and then sat down to
wait like the other girls.</i>

123
00:16:35,015 --> 00:16:37,893
<i>The sun passed
overhead several times,</i>

124
00:16:38,018 --> 00:16:41,688
<i>but we all came back
every morning and evening.</i>

125
00:16:49,112 --> 00:16:53,200
<i>That morning I went
to the square as usual.</i>

126
00:16:53,658 --> 00:16:55,577
<i>The others were already there.</i>

127
00:16:55,744 --> 00:16:57,996
<i>I sat down on the curb,</i>

128
00:16:58,163 --> 00:17:01,374
<i>as I did every day,
to wait on providence.</i>

129
00:17:06,296 --> 00:17:08,840
<i>She came up from behind.</i>

130
00:17:10,967 --> 00:17:13,178
<i>She paced before us.</i>

131
00:17:15,889 --> 00:17:18,350
<i>No one could see her eyes.</i>

132
00:17:18,850 --> 00:17:21,561
<i>She looked us over one by one.</i>

133
00:17:21,728 --> 00:17:24,731
<i>We could tell she was
looking for a maid.</i>

134
00:17:25,732 --> 00:17:28,360
<i>The other girls surrounded her.</i>

135
00:17:28,485 --> 00:17:30,695
<i>Each wanted to be chosen.</i>

136
00:17:30,862 --> 00:17:32,405
<i>She backed away</i>

137
00:17:32,530 --> 00:17:34,658
<i>from all the outstretched hands.</i>

138
00:17:34,991 --> 00:17:38,286
<i>I was getting up when
she came over to me</i>

139
00:17:38,411 --> 00:17:41,414
<i>and asked if I wanted
a job. “Yes, ma'am.”</i>

140
00:17:41,539 --> 00:17:44,542
<i>"Can you take care of
children?” "Yes, ma'am.'</i>

141
00:17:44,793 --> 00:17:47,379
<i>“Have you worked for
white people before?”</i>

142
00:17:47,671 --> 00:17:48,964
<i>“No, ma 'am. ”</i>

143
00:17:49,130 --> 00:17:52,300
<i>She hired me anyway.
I was so happy.</i>

144
00:17:52,425 --> 00:17:55,762
<i>I had a job! When I
maimed home that evening,</i>

145
00:17:55,929 --> 00:17:58,014
<i>I was very, very happy.</i>

146
00:18:30,964 --> 00:18:32,882
I've got a job!

147
00:18:33,091 --> 00:18:35,093
I've got a job!

148
00:18:35,218 --> 00:18:37,929
I've got a job with white folks!

149
00:18:42,267 --> 00:18:44,561
I've got a job with white folks!

150
00:18:54,154 --> 00:18:55,947
I've got a job!

151
00:18:56,239 --> 00:18:58,825
A job with white folks!

152
00:18:59,909 --> 00:19:02,871
<i>Mother was there as usual,</i>

153
00:19:02,996 --> 00:19:05,790
<i>and I told her about my job.</i>

154
00:19:06,499 --> 00:19:10,795
<i>She threw the mask aside
and told me to be brave.</i>

155
00:19:22,390 --> 00:19:26,519
Let me have the mask. I'll
give you 50 francs on payday.

156
00:19:37,739 --> 00:19:39,032
For me?

157
00:19:39,199 --> 00:19:40,784
Yes, ma'am.

158
00:19:47,916 --> 00:19:49,918
A present from the maid.

159
00:19:56,591 --> 00:19:58,635
Looks like the real thing.

160
00:20:49,811 --> 00:20:53,314
This is the new nanny
for the children.

161
00:20:53,440 --> 00:20:55,567
Explain the house rules to her:

162
00:20:55,692 --> 00:20:58,194
If she breaks anything,
she pays for it.

163
00:20:59,529 --> 00:21:01,948
Give her something to eat.
- Yes, ma'am.

164
00:21:16,212 --> 00:21:18,256
These are the children:

165
00:21:18,381 --> 00:21:19,716
Sophie...

166
00:21:19,841 --> 00:21:21,217
Damien...

167
00:21:21,426 --> 00:21:23,052
and Philippe.

168
00:21:24,971 --> 00:21:26,973
Now go play outside.

169
00:21:36,024 --> 00:21:39,027
<i>In Dakar I didn't do the cooking</i>

170
00:21:39,486 --> 00:21:41,321
<i>or the laundry.</i>

171
00:21:42,489 --> 00:21:44,616
<i>I only looked after the children.</i>

172
00:21:44,991 --> 00:21:47,118
<i>I took them for walks.</i>

173
00:21:47,327 --> 00:21:49,162
<i>I walked them to school</i>

174
00:21:49,329 --> 00:21:51,414
<i>and then home again.</i>

175
00:22:12,727 --> 00:22:14,896
<i>Senegal isn't safe.</i>

176
00:22:15,021 --> 00:22:17,023
<i>With Senghor it is.</i>

177
00:22:17,732 --> 00:22:20,693
<i>I have to think it
over. Don't pressure me.</i>

178
00:22:20,860 --> 00:22:22,529
<i>It's a golden opportunity.</i>

179
00:22:22,695 --> 00:22:25,615
<i>But all those coups
d'état! I have a family.</i>

180
00:22:25,740 --> 00:22:28,326
<i>It looks worse from
here than it is.</i>

181
00:22:28,451 --> 00:22:30,078
<i>But look at the Congo.</i>

182
00:22:30,286 --> 00:22:33,498
<i>Senegal isn't the Congo.
Life is easy there.</i>

183
00:22:33,623 --> 00:22:36,459
<i>How long before we'd
get back to France?</i>

184
00:22:36,626 --> 00:22:40,046
<i>You get leave every two
years. And there's no risk:</i>

185
00:22:40,213 --> 00:22:42,757
<i>Part of your salary
is paid in France.</i>

186
00:22:42,924 --> 00:22:45,677
<i>It sounds interesting.
What about housing?</i>

187
00:22:45,802 --> 00:22:48,596
<i>Everything's spelled
out in the contract.</i>

188
00:22:48,721 --> 00:22:50,431
You'd have no worries.

189
00:22:53,393 --> 00:22:54,727
Here's our coffee.

190
00:23:16,624 --> 00:23:18,793
- Does she speak French?
- No.

191
00:23:19,002 --> 00:23:21,754
- But she understands.
- You mean instinctively?

192
00:23:23,214 --> 00:23:24,757
I suppose so.

193
00:23:24,882 --> 00:23:27,468
Like an animal.

194
00:23:28,428 --> 00:23:30,888
In any case, she's
a very good cook.

195
00:23:32,557 --> 00:23:35,184
It's late. We have to go.

196
00:23:43,109 --> 00:23:45,278
You must come to Dakar.

197
00:23:48,448 --> 00:23:50,325
<i>Now I understand.</i>

198
00:23:50,450 --> 00:23:53,161
<i>Madame wanted a servant
who'd do everything.</i>

199
00:23:53,369 --> 00:23:55,663
<i>That's why she chose me.</i>

200
00:23:56,205 --> 00:23:57,832
<i>Why am I here?</i>

201
00:23:57,957 --> 00:24:01,628
<i>To look after the children
or to be a housemaid?</i>

202
00:24:28,529 --> 00:24:31,240
Have you noticed
anything about Diouana?

203
00:24:36,663 --> 00:24:38,206
Look.

204
00:24:38,498 --> 00:24:40,667
It's like she's wasting away.

205
00:24:42,335 --> 00:24:44,170
Maybe it's the climate.

206
00:24:44,504 --> 00:24:46,172
After all...

207
00:24:48,341 --> 00:24:51,219
The climate! She's
lazy, that's all.

208
00:24:52,929 --> 00:24:55,098
The children will be back soon.

209
00:24:55,264 --> 00:24:57,350
We have to think about that.

210
00:25:27,588 --> 00:25:30,550
Excuse me. I'm going to take a nap.

211
00:25:31,718 --> 00:25:35,722
You do that. Listen, I'm not
cutting short my vacation!

212
00:25:35,847 --> 00:25:37,849
I'm fed up with this life!

213
00:25:40,226 --> 00:25:42,145
All you do is drink!

214
00:25:42,562 --> 00:25:45,732
That has to stop when
the kids come back!

215
00:26:28,024 --> 00:26:29,942
I'm going for a walk.

216
00:26:40,119 --> 00:26:42,538
<i>She wasn't like that in Dakar.</i>

217
00:26:43,247 --> 00:26:44,832
<i>Neither was he.</i>

218
00:26:46,125 --> 00:26:47,960
<i>When the children arrive,</i>

219
00:26:48,127 --> 00:26:50,463
<i>who'll do the cooking and washing?</i>

220
00:27:22,495 --> 00:27:25,206
<i>Back in Dakar they
must be saying...</i>

221
00:27:26,123 --> 00:27:28,626
<i>“Diouana is happy in France.</i>

222
00:27:29,043 --> 00:27:31,003
<i>She has a good life. ”</i>

223
00:27:33,965 --> 00:27:38,135
<i>For me, France is the
kitchen, the living room,</i>

224
00:27:38,261 --> 00:27:41,430
<i>the bathroom, and my bedroom.</i>

225
00:27:43,850 --> 00:27:46,853
<i>Where are the people
who live in this country?</i>

226
00:27:48,771 --> 00:27:50,481
<i>Madame told me...</i>

227
00:27:50,606 --> 00:27:54,110
<i>“You'll see, Diouana. There
are lovely shops in France.”</i>

228
00:27:54,944 --> 00:27:57,613
<i>Is France that black void?</i>

229
00:28:04,287 --> 00:28:06,163
<i>What am I here?</i>

230
00:28:08,124 --> 00:28:09,750
<i>The cook?</i>

231
00:28:10,209 --> 00:28:11,752
<i>The cleaning woman?</i>

232
00:28:12,086 --> 00:28:13,754
<i>The laundress?</i>

233
00:28:14,130 --> 00:28:18,217
<i>And when the kids arrive,
what else will I have to do?</i>

234
00:28:20,845 --> 00:28:22,513
<i>I'm all alone.</i>

235
00:28:24,724 --> 00:28:28,060
<i>Did Madame bring me
here to shut me in?</i>

236
00:28:29,437 --> 00:28:33,691
<i>That's why she was so
nice to me in Dakar...</i>

237
00:28:33,983 --> 00:28:36,152
<i>giving me her old dresses...</i>

238
00:28:36,402 --> 00:28:38,404
<i>her old slips...</i>

239
00:28:39,113 --> 00:28:40,865
<i>Her old shoes.</i>

240
00:29:00,092 --> 00:29:04,263
<i>I spend my life here in
the kitchen and my bedroom.</i>

241
00:29:04,764 --> 00:29:07,308
<i>Is this what living
in France means?</i>

242
00:30:04,323 --> 00:30:06,575
Diouana, wake up!

243
00:30:06,993 --> 00:30:08,995
Get up, lazybones!

244
00:30:12,999 --> 00:30:14,792
Will you get up?

245
00:30:16,002 --> 00:30:17,253
This isn't Africa!

246
00:30:17,795 --> 00:30:19,005
Get up!

247
00:30:21,966 --> 00:30:23,843
We're not in Africa!

248
00:31:17,521 --> 00:31:21,609
I didn't hire you to sleep
in. The children are here now.

249
00:32:03,484 --> 00:32:05,611
Diouana, come out of there!

250
00:32:06,112 --> 00:32:08,030
I know you're finished!

251
00:32:09,073 --> 00:32:11,200
Diouana, get out here!

252
00:32:15,579 --> 00:32:19,792
Come out of there!

253
00:32:26,841 --> 00:32:28,592
Come out here!

254
00:32:29,468 --> 00:32:31,512
What's going on?

255
00:32:31,804 --> 00:32:33,931
Diouana won't come out!

256
00:32:34,306 --> 00:32:37,893
I had to make the coffee
myself! She's useless!

257
00:32:40,688 --> 00:32:42,731
Soon I'll be the maid here.

258
00:32:49,613 --> 00:32:51,699
- Morning, son.
- Morning, Daddy.

259
00:32:52,116 --> 00:32:53,826
Go get dressed.

260
00:33:39,455 --> 00:33:43,209
Perhaps a rest would do
her good. She needs one.

261
00:33:43,542 --> 00:33:46,337
- What for?
- She could see the town.

262
00:33:46,462 --> 00:33:49,215
She knows no one
here but the grocer.

263
00:33:49,423 --> 00:33:51,550
And I'm responsible for her.

264
00:34:49,233 --> 00:34:51,443
Philippe, go play outside.

265
00:34:57,449 --> 00:35:00,202
Careful with your
balloon by the window!

266
00:36:17,571 --> 00:36:20,657
Take those shoes off.
Don't forget you're a maid.

267
00:36:20,783 --> 00:36:23,577
The kids are here
now. The picnic's over.

268
00:37:03,075 --> 00:37:05,994
- Diouana, are you ill?
- No, ma'am.

269
00:37:06,453 --> 00:37:07,913
Then what is it?

270
00:37:08,247 --> 00:37:10,916
If you don't work, you don't eat.

271
00:37:13,377 --> 00:37:17,214
<i>If I don't eat, I don't
take care of the children.</i>

272
00:37:25,764 --> 00:37:28,058
Mail from Dakar.

273
00:37:30,227 --> 00:37:32,604
Diouana, there's a letter for you.

274
00:37:35,858 --> 00:37:37,484
It's from Dakar.

275
00:37:38,569 --> 00:37:40,988
Shall I read it to you?
- Yes.

276
00:37:47,494 --> 00:37:49,288
It's from your mother.

277
00:37:49,496 --> 00:37:52,875
“Dearest daughter, this
is your mother writing.

278
00:37:53,292 --> 00:37:57,629
I've had no word from
you since you left.

279
00:37:57,880 --> 00:38:02,050
I got your employers'
address through Tive Correa.

280
00:38:02,176 --> 00:38:05,637
My health is getting
worse by the day.

281
00:38:06,555 --> 00:38:08,640
Why do you leave me penniless?

282
00:38:08,765 --> 00:38:12,311
I've nothing to live on while
you squander your wages there.

283
00:38:12,519 --> 00:38:16,815
I know you can't write, but I'm sure
your employer will write for you,

284
00:38:16,982 --> 00:38:18,984
because she's a lady and a mother.

285
00:38:19,485 --> 00:38:21,945
Didn't she give you
her cast-off clothes?

286
00:38:22,070 --> 00:38:24,156
She'll write a letter for you.

287
00:38:24,281 --> 00:38:27,075
You mustn't think only of yourself.

288
00:38:27,201 --> 00:38:29,244
You've sent nothing since you left.

289
00:38:29,369 --> 00:38:32,789
You're earning a salary.
What do you do with it?

290
00:38:33,457 --> 00:38:35,250
Think of your poor mother,

291
00:38:35,375 --> 00:38:39,087
who has to pay even for water.

292
00:38:39,505 --> 00:38:43,342
I think of you and pray
for you and your employers.

293
00:38:44,885 --> 00:38:46,386
Your mother.”

294
00:38:46,845 --> 00:38:48,847
We'll send a reply.

295
00:38:56,522 --> 00:38:59,483
We'll write back.
- I hope this will help.

296
00:39:04,071 --> 00:39:06,031
“Dear Mother...

297
00:39:06,323 --> 00:39:10,244
I received your letter...”

298
00:39:12,871 --> 00:39:15,374
What else do you want to say?

299
00:39:16,166 --> 00:39:18,335
Tell us what to write.

300
00:39:19,044 --> 00:39:22,214
I'll keep going. Stop
me if you don't agree.

301
00:39:22,464 --> 00:39:26,218
“Dear Mother, I
received your letter.

302
00:39:27,177 --> 00:39:30,389
I'm in good health,
and I think of you.

303
00:39:31,348 --> 00:39:35,060
Madame hasn't had time
to write on my behalf...”

304
00:39:35,269 --> 00:39:38,730
<i>It's not true. That
letter wasn't to me.</i>

305
00:39:39,898 --> 00:39:41,942
<i>My mother didn't write it,</i>

306
00:39:42,067 --> 00:39:45,654
<i>just like I didn't ask
Monsieur to reply for me.</i>

307
00:39:47,072 --> 00:39:49,449
<i>And Madame is no lady.</i>

308
00:39:50,242 --> 00:39:52,578
<i>It's because I can't write.</i>

309
00:39:52,703 --> 00:39:56,915
<i>If I could, I'd tell all
about Madame 's “kindness. ”</i>

310
00:39:57,165 --> 00:39:59,585
<i>I'm a prisoner here.</i>

311
00:40:10,596 --> 00:40:13,932
She's crazy! It's her own mother!

312
00:40:17,227 --> 00:40:19,313
<i>I'm their prisoner.</i>

313
00:40:19,688 --> 00:40:21,773
<i>I don't know anyone here.</i>

314
00:40:21,898 --> 00:40:24,610
<i>I have no family here.</i>

315
00:40:25,110 --> 00:40:27,654
<i>That's why I'm their slave.</i>

316
00:40:43,128 --> 00:40:45,464
Go play with Diouana.

317
00:40:50,302 --> 00:40:51,928
Let's go.

318
00:40:59,394 --> 00:41:03,440
Diouana, you want to play?
Mom and Dad have gone out.

319
00:41:15,786 --> 00:41:17,829
<i>This mask is mine.</i>

320
00:41:20,540 --> 00:41:22,459
<i>Madame deceived me.</i>

321
00:41:22,668 --> 00:41:25,045
<i>Let her take care of her own son.</i>

322
00:41:25,295 --> 00:41:29,091
<i>If she won't feed me, she
can take care of him herself.</i>

323
00:41:32,427 --> 00:41:33,970
Can I come in?

324
00:41:34,596 --> 00:41:38,600
Diouana, when will my
brother and sister be back?

325
00:41:47,859 --> 00:41:49,486
<i>I don't know.</i>

326
00:41:49,736 --> 00:41:52,739
<i>I haven't eaten. I won't work.</i>

327
00:41:53,699 --> 00:41:55,951
<i>I'm not Madame's plaything.</i>

328
00:41:56,785 --> 00:41:58,912
<i>They're fighting again upstairs.</i>

329
00:41:59,371 --> 00:42:01,581
<i>That's life in France.</i>

330
00:42:05,711 --> 00:42:07,879
<i>Why did I want to come here?</i>

331
00:42:09,840 --> 00:42:13,427
<i>Madame had given me a
dress and a suitcase,</i>

332
00:42:13,552 --> 00:42:17,222
<i>and I went with him for
a walk through the city.</i>

333
00:42:17,931 --> 00:42:20,726
<i>All I could think of
was the trip ahead.</i>

334
00:42:21,685 --> 00:42:24,146
<i>We had our picture taken.</i>

335
00:42:24,730 --> 00:42:28,942
<i>We quarreled because he
did something I didn't like.</i>

336
00:42:29,943 --> 00:42:32,362
<i>I got mad and walked away.</i>

337
00:42:33,697 --> 00:42:36,074
<i>All I could think of was my trip:</i>

338
00:42:36,199 --> 00:42:38,577
<i>I was going to France!</i>

339
00:43:26,416 --> 00:43:28,960
You think France is
prettier than this?

340
00:43:30,003 --> 00:43:32,798
How would I know?
I've never been there.

341
00:43:38,970 --> 00:43:42,474
Madame asked if I
wanted to go with her.

342
00:43:43,475 --> 00:43:46,603
- What for?
- To look after the children.

343
00:43:53,068 --> 00:43:55,904
<i>He's angry. He's going to say...</i>

344
00:43:56,321 --> 00:43:58,657
<i>“That's domestic slavery!”</i>

345
00:43:58,865 --> 00:44:02,619
<i>But my mother said all
right, so I'm going to France.</i>

346
00:44:03,620 --> 00:44:05,580
<i>To France!</i>

347
00:44:11,169 --> 00:44:13,338
FOR OUR DEAD FROM A GRATEFUL NATION

348
00:44:24,808 --> 00:44:26,685
Get down from there!

349
00:44:26,810 --> 00:44:28,603
That's a sacrilege!

350
00:44:29,062 --> 00:44:30,188
Come down!

351
00:44:31,690 --> 00:44:33,358
Don't stay up there!

352
00:44:33,525 --> 00:44:35,402
Come down!

353
00:44:38,822 --> 00:44:40,490
You hear me?

354
00:44:41,449 --> 00:44:42,951
Get down!

355
00:44:44,035 --> 00:44:45,829
Hurry up!

356
00:44:49,374 --> 00:44:50,876
Get down!

357
00:44:55,922 --> 00:44:57,507
Jump.

358
00:45:08,351 --> 00:45:10,770
Come on. I'll take you to France.

359
00:46:00,111 --> 00:46:02,447
- Just think.
- What?

360
00:46:02,614 --> 00:46:05,951
I'm going to France
with my employer.

361
00:46:08,787 --> 00:46:11,957
- What do you think you'll do there?
- I'll see the sights.

362
00:46:24,177 --> 00:46:26,179
<i>Why is he sulking?</i>

363
00:46:28,098 --> 00:46:32,060
<i>I'm in his room. What
more does he want?</i>

364
00:46:38,900 --> 00:46:40,944
<i>I have to go to France.</i>

365
00:46:41,236 --> 00:46:43,655
<i>I promised Madame.</i>

366
00:47:44,299 --> 00:47:46,384
She didn't do the dishes!

367
00:48:00,065 --> 00:48:02,859
Where can she be?
- How would I know?

368
00:48:05,904 --> 00:48:07,614
Sleeping again!

369
00:48:10,700 --> 00:48:12,243
On your feet!

370
00:48:30,261 --> 00:48:31,971
Where's the mask?

371
00:48:39,187 --> 00:48:40,772
Are you ill?

372
00:48:45,068 --> 00:48:47,237
Do you want your money?

373
00:48:48,863 --> 00:48:51,324
Here's 20,000 francs.

374
00:49:03,461 --> 00:49:05,421
Honey, come look.

375
00:49:06,965 --> 00:49:08,633
What's wrong with her?

376
00:49:08,758 --> 00:49:12,095
I don't know. Let's
leave her alone.

377
00:49:28,153 --> 00:49:30,155
Here's the mask!

378
00:49:34,534 --> 00:49:35,660
It's mine!

379
00:49:36,327 --> 00:49:38,413
- Let go!
- It's mine!

380
00:49:40,665 --> 00:49:43,126
I said let go!

381
00:49:43,668 --> 00:49:45,170
Help!

382
00:49:46,963 --> 00:49:49,090
She's out of her mind!

383
00:49:49,257 --> 00:49:51,176
She took down the mask.

384
00:49:51,342 --> 00:49:54,345
It's hers. She gave it to you.

385
00:49:54,512 --> 00:49:57,682
Ungrateful girl! After
all I've done for her!

386
00:50:07,442 --> 00:50:09,444
<i>This mask is mine.</i>

387
00:50:09,986 --> 00:50:12,197
<i>I paid 50 francs for it.</i>

388
00:50:14,449 --> 00:50:18,411
<i>Madame will never scold me again.</i>

389
00:50:19,495 --> 00:50:23,041
<i>Never again will she tell
me, “Diouana, make coffee.”</i>

390
00:50:25,126 --> 00:50:28,504
<i>Never again, “Diouana,
fix some rice.”</i>

391
00:50:30,381 --> 00:50:33,968
<i>Never again, 'Diouana.
take off your shoes.”</i>

392
00:50:38,014 --> 00:50:41,893
<i>Never again, "Diouana,
mash my husband's shin: "</i>

393
00:50:43,895 --> 00:50:47,148
<i>Never again,
“Diouana, you're lazy.”</i>

394
00:50:47,815 --> 00:50:49,817
<i>I'll never be a slave!</i>

395
00:50:52,070 --> 00:50:55,531
<i>I didn't come here for
the apron and the money.</i>

396
00:51:00,495 --> 00:51:02,747
<i>She'll never see me again.</i>

397
00:51:04,624 --> 00:51:07,418
<i>She'll never scold me again.</i>

398
00:51:09,462 --> 00:51:11,547
<i>Never again ”Diouana. ”</i>

399
00:51:11,756 --> 00:51:14,342
<i>I'll never see them ever again.</i>

400
00:51:53,673 --> 00:51:55,466
<i>Madame lied.</i>

401
00:51:56,092 --> 00:51:58,052
<i>She's lied all along.</i>

402
00:51:58,970 --> 00:52:01,139
<i>She'll never lie to me again.</i>

403
00:52:01,639 --> 00:52:04,350
<i>Never again will she lie to me.</i>

404
00:52:05,351 --> 00:52:08,313
<i>She wanted to keep
me here as her slave.</i>

405
00:52:54,108 --> 00:52:59,155
BLACK GIRL SLASHES THROAT
IN EMPLOYER"S BATHROOM

406
00:53:17,882 --> 00:53:20,093
We're going back to Dakar.

407
00:53:57,422 --> 00:53:59,424
Her bathrobe.

408
00:55:37,188 --> 00:55:38,731
Excuse me.

409
00:55:43,778 --> 00:55:45,321
Follow me.

410
00:56:07,218 --> 00:56:09,303
This is Diouana's employer.

411
00:56:18,104 --> 00:56:19,647
Come with me.

412
00:56:20,565 --> 00:56:22,066
This way.

413
00:56:49,594 --> 00:56:52,430
Mother, this is Diouana's employer.

414
00:56:53,097 --> 00:56:55,600
This is Diouana's mother.

415
00:56:59,228 --> 00:57:00,438
For you.

416
00:57:01,772 --> 00:57:02,940
Here.

417
00:57:05,985 --> 00:57:08,362
Take it. It's for you.

418
00:57:10,615 --> 00:57:12,116
Take it!

419
00:57:13,909 --> 00:57:16,704
She doesn't want
it. Keep your money.
