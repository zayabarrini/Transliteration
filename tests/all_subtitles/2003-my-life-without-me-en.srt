1
00:00:42,727 --> 00:00:44,138
<i>This is you. </i>

2
00:00:45,021 --> 00:00:47,014
<i>Eyes closed, </i>
<i>out in the rain. </i>

3
00:00:48,066 --> 00:00:50,687
<i>You never thought you'd be doing</i>
<i>something like this. </i>

4
00:00:51,611 --> 00:00:53,271
<i>You never saw yourself as, </i>

5
00:00:54,656 --> 00:00:56,364
<i>l don't know</i>
<i>how you'd describe it, as... </i>

6
00:00:56,532 --> 00:00:57,731
<i>like one of those people</i>

7
00:00:57,909 --> 00:01:00,115
<i>who like looking up at the moon, </i>

8
00:01:00,286 --> 00:01:03,572
<i>or who spend hours gazing at</i>
<i>the waves or the sunset or... </i>

9
00:01:04,874 --> 00:01:07,579
<i>l guess you know what kind of people</i>
<i>l'm talking about</i>

10
00:01:08,670 --> 00:01:09,868
<i>Maybe you don't</i>

11
00:01:11,339 --> 00:01:14,126
<i>Anyway, you kinda you kinda</i>
<i>like it being like this, </i>

12
00:01:15,343 --> 00:01:16,921
<i>fighting the cold</i>

13
00:01:18,012 --> 00:01:19,922
<i>and feeling the water seep</i>
<i>through your shirt</i>

14
00:01:20,098 --> 00:01:21,509
<i>and getting through to your skin. </i>

15
00:01:23,393 --> 00:01:24,887
<i>And the feel of the ground</i>

16
00:01:25,061 --> 00:01:27,517
<i>growing soft beneath your feet</i>

17
00:01:28,106 --> 00:01:29,268
<i>and the smell. </i>

18
00:01:31,359 --> 00:01:34,230
<i>And the sound of the rain</i>
<i>hitting the leaves. </i>

19
00:01:36,739 --> 00:01:39,776
<i>All the things they talk about</i>
<i>in the books that you haven't read. </i>

20
00:01:41,870 --> 00:01:43,114
<i>This is you. </i>

21
00:01:45,540 --> 00:01:46,915
<i>Who would have guessed it?. </i>

22
00:01:48,960 --> 00:01:49,956
<i>You. </i>

23
00:02:28,750 --> 00:02:30,160
<i>Lesson 3. </i>

24
00:02:30,501 --> 00:02:31,533
<i>Dialogue. </i>

25
00:02:36,799 --> 00:02:38,128
Catch this.

26
00:02:38,426 --> 00:02:39,837
You giv<i>e</i> me the big one.

27
00:02:40,136 --> 00:02:41,002
OK.

28
00:02:41,387 --> 00:02:42,716
Don't you <i>e</i>ven...

29
00:02:45,975 --> 00:02:47,802
So how come you always get...

30
00:02:50,813 --> 00:02:53,055
why do you <i>a</i>lways
get th<i>e</i> big one?

31
00:02:54,067 --> 00:02:55,644
I deserve the big one...

32
00:02:57,987 --> 00:03:00,063
Maybe you should just try
and you know

33
00:03:00,907 --> 00:03:02,946
to get chalk of the blackboard.

34
00:03:09,082 --> 00:03:09,828
Laurie...

35
00:03:09,999 --> 00:03:11,992
Oh, l'm trying to bIow it
away from you.

36
00:03:12,168 --> 00:03:14,659
- l thought you were quitting.
- l am quitting. l'm quitting, quitting.

37
00:03:14,837 --> 00:03:15,786
That's gre<i>a</i>t.

38
00:03:17,215 --> 00:03:18,958
l can't quit smoking

39
00:03:19,259 --> 00:03:21,928
and quit eating at the same tim<i>e. </i>

40
00:03:22,303 --> 00:03:24,759
You don't have to quit <i>e</i>ating.
Why would you have to quit e<i>a</i>ting?

41
00:03:24,931 --> 00:03:26,129
You just don't understand.

42
00:03:26,307 --> 00:03:28,549
You Iose weight
just by thinking about it.

43
00:03:28,851 --> 00:03:31,888
I swear you're slimmer now
than you were a month ago.

44
00:03:32,063 --> 00:03:34,388
- No, you're imagining it.
- l am not.

45
00:03:35,358 --> 00:03:37,351
When you're fat
like l am,

46
00:03:37,527 --> 00:03:40,481
th<i>e</i> only thing you see
is other women's bodies.

47
00:03:40,697 --> 00:03:42,440
lt's the only thing you see.

48
00:03:42,615 --> 00:03:44,407
L<i>a</i>urie, you'r<i>e</i> crazy.

49
00:03:44,993 --> 00:03:46,653
You're not fat at all, okay?

50
00:03:46,828 --> 00:03:49,449
l know fat peopl<i>e. </i> You're not one
of them. Look <i>a</i>t this tummy.

51
00:03:49,622 --> 00:03:51,531
It's not the tummy of <i>a</i> fat person.

52
00:03:52,417 --> 00:03:53,827
As for me,
l'm eating the s<i>a</i>me as always.

53
00:03:54,002 --> 00:03:55,496
Yesterd<i>a</i>y,
I <i>a</i>te a whole litre of ice-cream.

54
00:03:55,920 --> 00:03:58,292
l haven't had ice-cream
in so long.

55
00:04:01,885 --> 00:04:02,798
Say,

56
00:04:03,720 --> 00:04:05,759
you're not following one of those
ic<i>e</i>-cream di<i>e</i>ts are you?

57
00:04:05,930 --> 00:04:08,006
Y<i>e</i>ah, Ben and Jerry's
miracle di<i>e</i>t.

58
00:04:08,266 --> 00:04:08,882
Really?

59
00:04:09,183 --> 00:04:10,013
No.

60
00:04:10,768 --> 00:04:12,179
You know
wh<i>a</i>t l'm thinking of right now?

61
00:04:12,353 --> 00:04:13,100
Wh<i>a</i>t?

62
00:04:13,605 --> 00:04:14,803
Corn on the cob.

63
00:04:16,024 --> 00:04:18,515
With lots of salt, lots of butter.

64
00:04:19,277 --> 00:04:21,483
Just talking about diets
makes me hungry.

65
00:04:21,946 --> 00:04:22,895
See you tomorrow.

66
00:04:23,072 --> 00:04:24,864
- All right. See you tomorrow.
- Tomorrow.

67
00:04:25,033 --> 00:04:26,112
Bye.

68
00:05:16,501 --> 00:05:18,078
ls Don going to look for another job?

69
00:05:18,503 --> 00:05:20,330
Don's alw<i>a</i>ys looking for another job.

70
00:05:21,172 --> 00:05:23,580
l could try and get him
something at the hot<i>e</i>l.

71
00:05:24,425 --> 00:05:25,706
That's okay.

72
00:05:26,594 --> 00:05:29,381
Last thing l n<i>e</i>ed is for you two
to fight there as well.

73
00:05:38,523 --> 00:05:40,231
Why do you hav<i>e</i>
to listen to this stuff?

74
00:05:40,400 --> 00:05:43,317
Why can't you list<i>e</i>n to music
like normal people?

75
00:05:51,953 --> 00:05:53,233
No one's normal, Mom.

76
00:05:55,164 --> 00:05:56,824
No such thing as normal people.

77
00:06:25,153 --> 00:06:27,192
Some muffins for the girls,
for bre<i>a</i>kf<i>a</i>st.

78
00:06:27,363 --> 00:06:30,115
They're a littIe squashed,
but they're fine.

79
00:06:30,408 --> 00:06:32,068
Who rent<i>e</i>d Nathan's hous<i>e</i>?

80
00:06:33,786 --> 00:06:36,159
l don't know.
Someon<i>e</i>'s moving in on Sunday.

81
00:06:39,167 --> 00:06:40,744
Barry Manilow.

82
00:06:40,919 --> 00:06:41,749
Wh<i>a</i>t?

83
00:06:42,295 --> 00:06:44,833
Barry Manilow.
H<i>e</i>'s normal.

84
00:06:46,007 --> 00:06:47,170
Good night, mom.

85
00:07:28,174 --> 00:07:31,508
Com<i>e</i> on. Move ov<i>e</i>r, buddy.

86
00:07:40,687 --> 00:07:43,972
Are those your feet or are you rubbing
ice-cub<i>e</i>s down my legs?

87
00:07:44,148 --> 00:07:45,691
Y<i>e</i>s, they <i>a</i>re ice-cubes.

88
00:07:47,902 --> 00:07:51,236
Ok<i>a</i>y, warm them up.
That's my only choice.

89
00:08:07,463 --> 00:08:09,171
l'm cold up here, too.

90
00:08:09,340 --> 00:08:11,084
l'm cold everywhere.

91
00:08:16,723 --> 00:08:18,846
Did you put all the laundry
in the basket?

92
00:08:19,559 --> 00:08:21,018
- Y<i>e</i>s.
<i>-Thank you. </i>

93
00:08:21,769 --> 00:08:22,884
Are you tired?

94
00:08:23,938 --> 00:08:24,804
Okay.

95
00:08:25,023 --> 00:08:26,481
No!

96
00:08:36,284 --> 00:08:39,735
I think you're too little.
l'll tell you when you're older.

97
00:08:39,913 --> 00:08:40,908
You guys want some more milk?

98
00:08:41,080 --> 00:08:42,195
Pl<i>e</i>as<i>e</i>, please, teIl me now.

99
00:08:42,373 --> 00:08:45,208
Drink up your milk. We've going to go
in about five minutes, all right?

100
00:08:47,921 --> 00:08:51,005
You've spilt your milk.
I told you, you're too Iittle.

101
00:08:51,174 --> 00:08:54,377
Shit, Patsy, can you not drink a gl<i>a</i>ss
of milk for once without spilling it?

102
00:08:56,387 --> 00:08:57,882
No, no, no.

103
00:08:58,139 --> 00:08:59,170
Wh<i>a</i>t are you doing?

104
00:08:59,349 --> 00:09:01,887
Daddy, why don't the Flintstones
<i>e</i>ver go to the beach?

105
00:09:02,060 --> 00:09:03,887
l don't know. Don't change the subj<i>e</i>ct.

106
00:09:04,062 --> 00:09:06,054
Wher<i>e</i> does Mommy
keep your sweaters?

107
00:09:07,815 --> 00:09:10,485
Mommy, l ate all my cere<i>a</i>l
and Patsy didn't.

108
00:09:11,486 --> 00:09:13,313
lt's okay, we have accidents.

109
00:09:13,488 --> 00:09:15,315
OK. Under the girls' bed,
in the green box,

110
00:09:15,490 --> 00:09:16,984
there's another sweater under th<i>e</i>re.

111
00:09:17,158 --> 00:09:18,487
Okay, put up your arms.

112
00:09:18,660 --> 00:09:20,948
Come on, we've got to take this off,
okay girlie?

113
00:09:21,287 --> 00:09:22,746
Got a little bit of milk on you.

114
00:09:22,914 --> 00:09:24,076
Are you stuck?

115
00:09:24,249 --> 00:09:27,166
Where's Patsy? l don't know.
There's Patsy.

116
00:09:28,670 --> 00:09:30,128
Th<i>e</i>re you go. Here you go.
Put that on.

117
00:09:31,422 --> 00:09:34,340
Lance's brother rang me last night.
H<i>e</i> said he might have something for me.

118
00:09:34,509 --> 00:09:36,086
No way!
Gr<i>e</i>at!

119
00:09:36,261 --> 00:09:37,803
Where are the k<i>e</i>ys?
l can't find the k<i>e</i>ys.

120
00:09:37,971 --> 00:09:40,010
- They're still in the ignition, l think.
- They are?

121
00:09:40,181 --> 00:09:42,174
Girls, you've got to put on
your jackets.

122
00:09:43,434 --> 00:09:45,925
Mommy, do l have to tell Patsy
where babies come from?

123
00:09:46,104 --> 00:09:48,180
- l think she's too little.
- She is too little.

124
00:09:48,356 --> 00:09:49,981
Can you put on your jacket first?

125
00:09:50,149 --> 00:09:52,723
They open<i>e</i>d a swimming pool
busin<i>e</i>ss in Wilmington Drive.

126
00:09:52,902 --> 00:09:54,313
- No way.
- Y<i>e</i>ah.

127
00:09:54,696 --> 00:09:55,775
I know.

128
00:09:56,614 --> 00:09:58,406
- Good luck.
- Yeah, thank you.

129
00:09:59,158 --> 00:10:01,068
Can you...
You pick up the girIs from school,

130
00:10:01,244 --> 00:10:02,868
because l might not be back
till later.

131
00:10:03,079 --> 00:10:04,953
- Yeah, sur<i>e. </i> No problem.
- Ok<i>a</i>y. Guys?

132
00:10:05,123 --> 00:10:06,403
Put on your hats
and gloves, okay?

133
00:10:06,583 --> 00:10:09,702
l'm going to warm up the car <i>a</i>nd we're
going to be gone in two minutes, okay?

134
00:10:10,211 --> 00:10:11,705
Two minut<i>e</i>s. Y<i>e</i>s!

135
00:10:12,005 --> 00:10:13,713
l want you to help Patsy
with h<i>e</i>rs as w<i>e</i>ll, okay?

136
00:10:13,882 --> 00:10:15,126
So get yours on and h<i>e</i>lp.

137
00:10:15,383 --> 00:10:17,340
- Bye, guys. Have a good day.
- Bye, Mom.

138
00:10:17,510 --> 00:10:19,752
l got you, l got you.

139
00:11:11,022 --> 00:11:11,686
Ann,

140
00:11:12,482 --> 00:11:15,685
l'm hanging out some wash. You got
anything you want me to hang out?

141
00:11:20,031 --> 00:11:21,229
Ann, are you in there?

142
00:11:26,913 --> 00:11:29,486
Put your cIothes in the bag,
and put on the robe.

143
00:11:29,666 --> 00:11:31,124
Do you know
if this is going to tak<i>e</i> long?

144
00:11:31,292 --> 00:11:33,830
- l'm supposed to pick up my kids.
- l really have no idea.

145
00:11:34,045 --> 00:11:35,670
Can l just go teII my Mom
to pick them up for me?

146
00:11:35,838 --> 00:11:37,630
We can't make any exceptions.

147
00:11:39,300 --> 00:11:40,498
Is your mother outside?

148
00:11:40,677 --> 00:11:42,634
Yeah, she came with me.
Ann Matland.

149
00:11:42,804 --> 00:11:45,509
- l forgot to tell her.
- l'll see what I can do.

150
00:11:45,848 --> 00:11:48,636
Now if you could get undressed
or you really will be here aIl day.

151
00:11:49,102 --> 00:11:50,015
Thank you.

152
00:11:56,067 --> 00:11:56,731
John,

153
00:11:56,901 --> 00:11:58,941
Charlie Bob, Seymour,

154
00:11:59,112 --> 00:12:00,274
Jack and Bill.

155
00:12:06,536 --> 00:12:08,279
Follow me, please.

156
00:12:08,538 --> 00:12:10,365
Hey, do you know if the other nurse told
my mom she had to go pick up my kids?

157
00:12:10,540 --> 00:12:11,868
l was supposed to go
and pick them up today and...

158
00:12:12,041 --> 00:12:12,658
Who'd you tell it to?

159
00:12:12,834 --> 00:12:13,913
The other nurse.
I don't know her name.

160
00:12:15,169 --> 00:12:17,577
Do you know how many nurses
we have working in this hospital?

161
00:12:18,715 --> 00:12:20,921
Do you know what it's like to be waiting
at the school gat<i>e a</i>ll on your own,

162
00:12:21,092 --> 00:12:22,088
with your nose fre<i>e</i>zing to death

163
00:12:22,260 --> 00:12:23,920
while aII the other kids
get picked up by th<i>e</i>ir moms?

164
00:12:29,893 --> 00:12:30,972
Yeah, l do.

165
00:12:31,603 --> 00:12:33,512
I'II go se<i>e</i> if l can find
your moth<i>e</i>r.

166
00:12:44,949 --> 00:12:47,072
Hi Ann.
l am Doctor Thompson,

167
00:12:47,660 --> 00:12:50,495
l'll be looking at th<i>e</i> results
of your ultrasound.

168
00:12:56,210 --> 00:12:57,835
Why are we doing this again?

169
00:13:00,048 --> 00:13:01,328
How are your kids?

170
00:13:01,799 --> 00:13:03,543
l'm kind of worried, actually,

171
00:13:03,718 --> 00:13:05,794
I was supposed
to pick them up today so...

172
00:13:05,970 --> 00:13:08,805
Let's not worry about thatjust now.
This will be over in a few minutes.

173
00:13:41,297 --> 00:13:43,669
Ann, would you excuse me for a moment?

174
00:13:44,092 --> 00:13:45,716
Y<i>e</i>ah, sure. lt's your hospital.

175
00:13:51,891 --> 00:13:53,884
Ann, this is Doctor Stuart
and Doctor L<i>a</i>nce.

176
00:13:54,060 --> 00:13:57,096
Hi! Do you know if someon<i>e</i> told my mom
<i>a</i>bout picking up my daughters?

177
00:13:57,522 --> 00:13:59,929
We're onIy gonna take
<i>a</i> few minutes, okay?

178
00:14:06,114 --> 00:14:07,905
Does your husband Iive with you?

179
00:14:08,074 --> 00:14:09,237
Yeah,

180
00:14:10,994 --> 00:14:13,152
he<i>. . </i> he builds swimming pools.
He was out all day today.

181
00:14:13,580 --> 00:14:15,821
And you work at the university.

182
00:14:16,916 --> 00:14:18,956
Yeah. l clean the university. Nights.

183
00:14:19,419 --> 00:14:20,794
And you're twenty-three...

184
00:14:22,005 --> 00:14:24,840
l'll be twenty four in December.
l'm <i>a</i>n Aquarius.

185
00:14:25,758 --> 00:14:28,843
How about you? What star sign are you?
What the hell is happening to me?

186
00:14:29,304 --> 00:14:32,470
We've don<i>e</i> th<i>e</i> scan
thre<i>e</i> times and...

187
00:14:32,682 --> 00:14:35,636
Are you sure you wouldn't prefer
to call your husband?

188
00:14:36,978 --> 00:14:38,638
No. l would pr<i>e</i>fer not to call him.

189
00:14:41,316 --> 00:14:45,265
We've done the scan three times,
and l've ordered a... a pre-biopsy...

190
00:14:45,445 --> 00:14:46,524
So, what?

191
00:14:48,489 --> 00:14:50,612
You have a tumour.

192
00:14:51,576 --> 00:14:52,821
In both ovaries.

193
00:14:53,453 --> 00:14:56,703
lt's reach<i>e</i>d your stomach and it's
beginning to spread to your liver.

194
00:15:05,715 --> 00:15:07,090
Wow. That's pretty f<i>a</i>r gone, eh?

195
00:15:08,176 --> 00:15:10,418
Ann, if you were twenty years older,

196
00:15:10,595 --> 00:15:14,094
the whole thing would be spreading
more slowly we could oper<i>a</i>te on it.

197
00:15:16,559 --> 00:15:17,888
But... your cells are very young.

198
00:15:18,061 --> 00:15:20,219
Too young, in fact

199
00:15:21,356 --> 00:15:23,847
and l'm afraid there's...
there's nothing we can do.

200
00:15:46,756 --> 00:15:47,669
Wow. How long?

201
00:15:48,633 --> 00:15:50,211
Two months, maybe three.

202
00:15:58,268 --> 00:16:00,391
Here's me thinking
l was pregnant...

203
00:16:02,564 --> 00:16:03,726
No, l'm afr<i>a</i>id not.

204
00:16:13,616 --> 00:16:16,403
l knew it was something pretty serious
when you sat down here beside me.

205
00:16:18,246 --> 00:16:21,781
They're renovating my office,
changing the air-conditioning and...

206
00:16:25,461 --> 00:16:26,837
No, that's not true...

207
00:16:28,715 --> 00:16:32,463
l can't sit down in front of someone
<i>a</i>nd tell them that they're gonna die...

208
00:16:34,971 --> 00:16:36,631
l've never been able to...

209
00:16:37,432 --> 00:16:39,923
the nurs<i>e</i>s are beginning
to m<i>e</i>ntion it.

210
00:16:43,897 --> 00:16:46,269
Your family might w<i>a</i>nna s<i>e</i>e
another doctor,

211
00:16:46,441 --> 00:16:48,149
they might want
a s<i>e</i>cond opinion.

212
00:16:48,318 --> 00:16:50,987
Someone who tells me the ex<i>a</i>ct s<i>a</i>me thing
as you, but looks me right in the ey<i>e</i>?

213
00:16:56,326 --> 00:16:57,784
Can l get you a coffee?

214
00:16:58,620 --> 00:16:59,533
No.

215
00:17:01,205 --> 00:17:02,071
Bourbon?

216
00:17:02,957 --> 00:17:04,701
Let me guess,
you'r<i>e</i> goinna offer m<i>e a</i> cig<i>a</i>rett<i>e</i>?

217
00:17:04,876 --> 00:17:05,706
No.

218
00:17:09,923 --> 00:17:11,251
Do have a piece of candy?

219
00:17:11,591 --> 00:17:12,836
A pi<i>e</i>ce of... ? Yeah.

220
00:17:22,518 --> 00:17:23,681
It's pretty good...

221
00:17:25,188 --> 00:17:26,563
what fl<i>a</i>vour is that?

222
00:17:27,774 --> 00:17:28,972
Ginger.

223
00:17:30,902 --> 00:17:31,981
It's pretty good.

224
00:17:33,947 --> 00:17:35,738
lt's a bit hot, but it's okay.

225
00:17:36,866 --> 00:17:39,950
l've... l've prepar<i>e</i>d some leaflets,
which more or less

226
00:17:40,536 --> 00:17:42,031
expl<i>a</i>in ev<i>e</i>rything,

227
00:17:42,497 --> 00:17:44,205
and some recipes

228
00:17:44,374 --> 00:17:45,702
to h<i>e</i>lp e<i>a</i>se the nause<i>a</i>,

229
00:17:45,917 --> 00:17:47,660
and l'd like to see you
next week.

230
00:17:47,835 --> 00:17:49,958
I've given you an appointment
and my direct line

231
00:17:50,129 --> 00:17:51,505
in case you n<i>e</i>ed to c<i>a</i>ll me.

232
00:17:54,342 --> 00:17:55,373
Y<i>e</i>ah... Okay.

233
00:17:55,927 --> 00:17:58,050
Do you have anoth<i>e</i>r piece of candy?
On<i>e</i> for the road?

234
00:17:59,347 --> 00:18:01,138
I'm sorry, that was my last one...

235
00:18:06,521 --> 00:18:08,976
Next week
l'll hav<i>e</i> more... candy.

236
00:18:09,732 --> 00:18:13,232
<i>Your Dad used to drink a bottle</i>
<i>of bourbon and call it breakfast. </i>

237
00:18:13,403 --> 00:18:15,146
<i>You get wired if you drink</i>
<i>so much as a beer. </i>

238
00:18:17,490 --> 00:18:19,399
<i>You didn't even take drugs</i>
<i>during high school, </i>

239
00:18:20,493 --> 00:18:22,652
<i>just the odd drag</i>
<i>of Don's joint. </i>

240
00:18:23,705 --> 00:18:26,990
<i>Without inhaling, like that guy who used</i>
<i>to be President of the United States, </i>

241
00:18:27,709 --> 00:18:28,989
<i>that guy Bill Clinton. </i>

242
00:18:30,044 --> 00:18:31,622
So, were they waiting long?

243
00:18:33,047 --> 00:18:34,292
Oh, good.

244
00:18:34,674 --> 00:18:36,880
Good, thanks a lot, Mom.
I owe you one.

245
00:18:37,802 --> 00:18:40,210
No, no, they're doing
blood analysis.

246
00:18:40,388 --> 00:18:43,093
Apparently l've got anaemia...
that's why l've b<i>e</i>en fainting.

247
00:18:45,977 --> 00:18:49,180
You know th<i>e</i>y're like, once they'v<i>e</i>
got you, they don't w<i>a</i>nt to let you go.

248
00:18:49,647 --> 00:18:52,221
Trying out some new machine,
they're like littl<i>e</i> kids.

249
00:18:53,026 --> 00:18:53,690
You know, l should go, Mom,

250
00:18:53,860 --> 00:18:55,235
'cause the nurse is coming to g<i>e</i>t me,
l've got to go.

251
00:18:56,279 --> 00:18:57,738
Okay, bye, thanks <i>a</i> lot.

252
00:19:00,158 --> 00:19:03,112
<i>Now you feel like you want to take</i>
<i>all the drugs in the world. </i>

253
00:19:04,203 --> 00:19:06,695
<i>But all the drugs in the world</i>
<i>aren't going to change the feeling</i>

254
00:19:06,873 --> 00:19:10,740
<i>that your whole life's been a dream</i>
<i>and it's only now that you're waking up. </i>

255
00:19:32,440 --> 00:19:35,145
"But l like to eat cake in a tub",
laugh<i>e</i>d the c<i>a</i>t.

256
00:19:35,318 --> 00:19:38,235
"You should try it sometime",
laughed the c<i>a</i>t as he sat.

257
00:19:38,571 --> 00:19:40,480
And then l got m<i>a</i>d,
ther<i>e</i> was no time for fun.

258
00:19:40,657 --> 00:19:42,483
l said "Cat you get out!"

259
00:19:44,452 --> 00:19:45,152
Hi, Mommy.

260
00:19:47,789 --> 00:19:49,200
Hi. You'v<i>e</i> be<i>e</i>n good?

261
00:19:49,374 --> 00:19:52,540
Mom, can you tell us a story?
Daddy says it too fast.

262
00:19:52,710 --> 00:19:55,581
Hey. Thanks a lot. You little monster.

263
00:19:56,589 --> 00:19:57,918
l don't read them too fast.

264
00:19:58,967 --> 00:20:01,422
- How <i>a</i>re you?
- Good. l've got anaemia,

265
00:20:01,594 --> 00:20:02,757
that's why l've b<i>e</i>en fainting,

266
00:20:02,929 --> 00:20:05,764
so th<i>e</i>y gav<i>e</i> me some iron and vitamins.
How did it go with Lance?

267
00:20:06,849 --> 00:20:08,260
l start on Monday.

268
00:20:08,643 --> 00:20:10,434
Hey, no w<i>a</i>y! That's so good.

269
00:20:10,603 --> 00:20:13,640
Y<i>e</i>s. I know, and there's enough work
for a year at l<i>e</i>ast.

270
00:20:13,815 --> 00:20:16,566
- That's so gre<i>a</i>t!
- l know, it's great.

271
00:20:16,901 --> 00:20:20,566
- Did you giv<i>e</i> th<i>e</i> girls something to eat?
- Daddy gave us milk shakes and fries.

272
00:20:20,738 --> 00:20:23,526
He said we mustn't telI you.
lt was so nice.

273
00:20:24,367 --> 00:20:27,570
Mommy, l at<i>e a</i>ll my fri<i>e</i>s
and all my milk shake.

274
00:20:27,745 --> 00:20:30,699
Fri<i>e</i>s are vegetables, right? They're
potatoes, which is a very good food.

275
00:20:30,873 --> 00:20:32,332
lt's one of the food groups.

276
00:20:32,500 --> 00:20:33,164
I'm sorry,

277
00:20:33,334 --> 00:20:35,042
it was a littl<i>e</i> treat. l just got a job.

278
00:20:35,211 --> 00:20:37,500
- What is wrong with you?
- l'm sorry.

279
00:20:37,839 --> 00:20:41,671
- Okay. The rafters, in a second.
- Can l stay, or should l go?

280
00:20:42,844 --> 00:20:44,124
You c<i>a</i>n stay.

281
00:20:45,221 --> 00:20:46,596
That's okay. Good night, you two.

282
00:20:49,767 --> 00:20:50,763
Close our ey<i>e</i>s.

283
00:20:51,728 --> 00:20:53,969
Close our ey<i>e</i>s.
We're setting off. Okay?

284
00:20:55,356 --> 00:20:56,186
Oh, no!

285
00:20:56,482 --> 00:20:58,356
lt's getting wavier <i>a</i>nd wavi<i>e</i>r
and we...

286
00:21:01,487 --> 00:21:03,195
and then we splash down in the water.

287
00:21:03,948 --> 00:21:04,814
No,

288
00:21:05,325 --> 00:21:07,317
- what's that?
- ls that a shark?

289
00:21:07,493 --> 00:21:08,869
lt is a shark.

290
00:21:09,037 --> 00:21:10,199
They're really really mad at us.

291
00:21:10,371 --> 00:21:11,996
They thought
th<i>a</i>t this river was the oce<i>a</i>n.

292
00:21:12,165 --> 00:21:13,410
They're really mad!

293
00:21:29,265 --> 00:21:30,759
Here, l think you should eat those.

294
00:21:35,104 --> 00:21:36,136
Are you going to go to work?

295
00:21:37,065 --> 00:21:38,263
Yeah, l'll go in.

296
00:21:38,566 --> 00:21:41,401
Your moth<i>e</i>r said she could get
a lift back if you w<i>a</i>nt to rest.

297
00:21:42,612 --> 00:21:43,608
No, l should go in.

298
00:21:44,530 --> 00:21:45,906
l thought you were pregnant.

299
00:21:48,409 --> 00:21:49,738
Ye<i>a</i>h. Me too.

300
00:21:52,163 --> 00:21:53,361
You sure you'r<i>e</i> all right?

301
00:21:53,581 --> 00:21:56,037
Yes, l'm good,
l'm just a little bit tir<i>e</i>d, that's all.

302
00:22:01,756 --> 00:22:05,042
You know, next month when l g<i>e</i>t
my paycheck we could go to Wh<i>a</i>lebay Beach.

303
00:22:05,635 --> 00:22:06,666
Would you like that?

304
00:22:07,136 --> 00:22:07,753
Yeah,

305
00:22:08,596 --> 00:22:09,675
that'd be nice.

306
00:22:10,181 --> 00:22:12,802
P<i>a</i>tsy hasn't <i>e</i>ven be<i>e</i>n
at the beach before.

307
00:22:14,936 --> 00:22:16,679
Yeah. l've got a good fe<i>e</i>ling
about things,

308
00:22:17,355 --> 00:22:19,312
with the swimming pooIs, l mean.

309
00:22:19,732 --> 00:22:20,728
l really do.

310
00:22:27,699 --> 00:22:28,612
<i>Thinking. </i>

311
00:22:29,659 --> 00:22:31,533
<i>You're not used</i>
<i>to thinking. </i>

312
00:22:32,370 --> 00:22:34,493
<i>When you have your first kid</i>
<i>at seventeen with the only man</i>

313
00:22:34,664 --> 00:22:36,123
<i>you've ever kissed in your life, </i>

314
00:22:36,708 --> 00:22:39,115
<i>and then another kid when you're</i>
<i>nineteen, with the same man, </i>

315
00:22:39,294 --> 00:22:41,785
<i>and you live in a trailer</i>
<i>in your Mom's backyard, </i>

316
00:22:41,963 --> 00:22:44,086
<i>and your Dad's been in jail</i>
<i>for ten years, </i>

317
00:22:44,257 --> 00:22:45,751
<i>you never have time to think. </i>

318
00:22:46,801 --> 00:22:50,300
<i>Maybe you're so out of practice</i>
<i>you've forgotten how. </i>

319
00:23:01,024 --> 00:23:02,815
- What is this?
- lt's coffee.

320
00:23:03,067 --> 00:23:07,314
- Yes. l asked for an espresso.
- Th<i>e e</i>spresso machine ain't working.

321
00:23:07,614 --> 00:23:09,191
So if the espresso machine
wasn't working,

322
00:23:09,365 --> 00:23:11,405
then why didn't you tell me
the espresso machine wasn't working?

323
00:23:11,576 --> 00:23:14,031
l figured you wanted coffee.

324
00:23:14,203 --> 00:23:16,492
You brought me a coffee.
I asked for an espr<i>e</i>sso.

325
00:23:16,664 --> 00:23:18,242
Okay, just relax.

326
00:23:18,833 --> 00:23:20,458
Com<i>e</i> back n<i>e</i>xt week,
we'll have espresso.

327
00:23:23,379 --> 00:23:26,001
- Hey, could you please lend me a pen?
- Sure, honey,

328
00:23:26,174 --> 00:23:28,131
just t<i>e</i>ll me what you w<i>a</i>nt first,
so as l can write it down

329
00:23:28,301 --> 00:23:30,756
and then l can lend it to you,
that way w<i>e</i>'II aIl be happy.

330
00:23:30,929 --> 00:23:32,589
Okay, l'll hav<i>e... </i>

331
00:23:33,264 --> 00:23:35,969
Don't say espresso because
th<i>e e</i>spresso machine ain't working...

332
00:23:36,142 --> 00:23:38,550
don't say cappuccino
'caus<i>e</i> it's the same machine.

333
00:23:38,728 --> 00:23:39,926
Ok<i>a</i>y, l'll have a...

334
00:23:40,980 --> 00:23:42,011
a Danish.

335
00:23:42,190 --> 00:23:43,850
Got no more 'til tomorrow.

336
00:23:44,776 --> 00:23:46,899
Can l g<i>e</i>t then a coffee and

337
00:23:47,737 --> 00:23:50,228
just something swe<i>e</i>t, like anything
you have that's sweet.

338
00:23:50,907 --> 00:23:52,816
Pineapple cheesecake?

339
00:23:52,992 --> 00:23:55,032
lt's the sweetest thing we got.
Actually it's the only thing we've got.

340
00:23:55,203 --> 00:23:56,994
That's fin<i>e</i>, that's great.
Pine<i>a</i>pple cheesecak<i>e. </i>

341
00:23:57,163 --> 00:23:58,112
Okay.

342
00:25:10,653 --> 00:25:13,607
Ther<i>e</i> you go,
the world's sweetest chees<i>e</i>cake.

343
00:25:13,907 --> 00:25:15,983
You can keep the pen
for as long as you ne<i>e</i>d it.

344
00:25:16,159 --> 00:25:18,068
I <i>a</i>lready filled
in the Iottery ticket <i>e</i>arlier.

345
00:25:18,328 --> 00:25:20,616
What <i>a</i>re you going to do if you win?
Have you decided?

346
00:25:20,788 --> 00:25:22,448
Have l ev<i>e</i>r, honey.

347
00:25:25,835 --> 00:25:27,080

348
00:25:28,004 --> 00:25:29,997
l want her nos<i>e</i>,

349
00:25:30,173 --> 00:25:32,212

350
00:25:32,383 --> 00:25:34,210
her hair, her waist...

351
00:25:34,385 --> 00:25:36,045
l'm going to be so much lik<i>e</i> Cher

352
00:25:36,220 --> 00:25:38,676
that folks ar<i>e</i> gonna stop me
in the supermarket and say

353
00:25:38,848 --> 00:25:41,256
<i>"Wasn't it terrible what happened</i>
<i>to dear old Sonny?"</i>

354
00:25:41,809 --> 00:25:42,889
What do you think?

355
00:25:44,020 --> 00:25:46,226
l think that's
a r<i>e</i>aIly fucking stupid ide<i>a. </i>

356
00:25:49,567 --> 00:25:50,433
l'm just kidding.

357
00:25:50,735 --> 00:25:51,980
I think Ch<i>e</i>r is great.

358
00:25:58,952 --> 00:26:02,367
Penny, Patsy, l'm making
a big heap of pancakes.

359
00:26:02,538 --> 00:26:03,819
lf you don't come right this second

360
00:26:03,998 --> 00:26:05,623
l'm going to eat all of them
all by myself.

361
00:26:05,833 --> 00:26:07,458
l'm coming, Mommy.

362
00:26:11,464 --> 00:26:13,042
- Morning, buddy.
- Hi, Mommy.

363
00:26:15,176 --> 00:26:17,335
l guess P<i>a</i>tsy do<i>e</i>sn't want
any pancakes, eh?

364
00:26:17,512 --> 00:26:19,136
No pancakes for Patsy.

365
00:26:23,101 --> 00:26:25,888
ls it Sunday yet?
ls it my birthday?

366
00:26:26,062 --> 00:26:27,390
No, but you know what?

367
00:26:27,563 --> 00:26:29,722
Last night l dreamt

368
00:26:29,899 --> 00:26:32,568
that you wok<i>e</i> up
like hungry lions

369
00:26:32,944 --> 00:26:35,233
and you ate lots of food.

370
00:26:44,205 --> 00:26:45,450
I'll cut it up for you. Ther<i>e</i> you go.

371
00:26:48,835 --> 00:26:50,958
Are you going to take
the kids to school?

372
00:26:58,678 --> 00:27:01,050
The bigg<i>e</i>st lion of th<i>e</i>m aIl.

373
00:27:01,222 --> 00:27:02,301
Go get him, Patsy.

374
00:27:04,892 --> 00:27:07,015
Bye. l Iove you, my little lions,

375
00:27:07,770 --> 00:27:08,968
l Iove you so much.

376
00:27:26,372 --> 00:27:27,653
l love you.

377
00:27:32,378 --> 00:27:33,754
l kind of want...

378
00:27:34,839 --> 00:27:36,084
something different.

379
00:27:37,634 --> 00:27:38,713
Different...

380
00:27:40,887 --> 00:27:42,714
To what l've got at th<i>e</i> moment, l mean.

381
00:27:43,598 --> 00:27:46,552
l could do you braids,
but it wouId take all day...

382
00:27:46,768 --> 00:27:48,595
and l'm on my own here
on Wednesdays, so...

383
00:27:48,770 --> 00:27:50,513
Not braids.
No way.

384
00:27:55,109 --> 00:27:57,019
Well, you've got good h<i>a</i>ir
for braids.

385
00:27:57,946 --> 00:28:00,187
And you asked for something
different, so...

386
00:28:00,490 --> 00:28:03,325
Braids are fine.
Th<i>e</i>y look great on you, but...

387
00:28:04,661 --> 00:28:06,238
l w<i>a</i>s thinking of som<i>e</i>thing mor<i>e... </i>

388
00:28:08,331 --> 00:28:09,659
How about blonde?

389
00:28:10,083 --> 00:28:11,114
Blonde?

390
00:28:11,751 --> 00:28:12,949
Something to kind of...

391
00:28:13,711 --> 00:28:16,629
- bright<i>e</i>n up my face a bit.
- Something bright.

392
00:28:17,423 --> 00:28:18,123
Like this?

393
00:28:18,299 --> 00:28:20,375
l was also wondering
about faIs<i>e</i> nails.

394
00:28:20,551 --> 00:28:21,583
l don't have any nails and...

395
00:28:22,387 --> 00:28:25,423
The girI who do<i>e</i>s the nails
doesn't come in W<i>e</i>dnesd<i>a</i>ys.

396
00:28:25,640 --> 00:28:27,467
You what then, why l don't just
com<i>e</i> back tomorrow then.

397
00:28:27,642 --> 00:28:30,180
We can do it all at the same time,
can't we?

398
00:28:30,436 --> 00:28:31,599
Braids as well?

399
00:28:32,855 --> 00:28:35,181
l'll think <i>a</i>bout it. Ok,
l'll see you tomorrow. Bye.

400
00:28:39,237 --> 00:28:41,064
l had two conventions today

401
00:28:41,239 --> 00:28:44,193
and l had to make a cake
for three hundred people

402
00:28:44,367 --> 00:28:46,075
in the shape of a tyr<i>e. </i>

403
00:28:48,496 --> 00:28:49,824
I'm beat.

404
00:28:52,750 --> 00:28:54,245
Even my hips ache.

405
00:28:56,087 --> 00:28:58,708
l think l'm going to make an appointment
to s<i>e</i>e the doctor tomorrow.

406
00:28:58,881 --> 00:29:00,589
My knee's acting up again as well.

407
00:29:02,594 --> 00:29:05,215
That d<i>a</i>mn cak<i>e</i> must have
weighed 30 pounds.

408
00:29:08,266 --> 00:29:10,305
How about you? You feeling any better?

409
00:29:10,810 --> 00:29:12,269
Yeah, I'm f<i>e</i>eIing fine.

410
00:29:14,147 --> 00:29:17,064
They say it's going to snow
this weekend, but l don't think so.

411
00:29:18,109 --> 00:29:19,354
l hate the snow.

412
00:29:21,321 --> 00:29:24,772
l like the snow
<i>e</i>ven l<i>e</i>ss than l like the rain.

413
00:29:28,578 --> 00:29:31,283
<i>... because you'll never be anything</i>
<i>but a common frump</i>

414
00:29:31,456 --> 00:29:33,329
<i>whose father lived over</i>
<i>a grocery store</i>

415
00:29:33,499 --> 00:29:35,207
<i>and whose mother took in washing. </i>

416
00:29:35,376 --> 00:29:36,787
<i>With this money, l can get away from</i>

417
00:29:36,961 --> 00:29:40,295
<i>every rotten stinking thing that</i>
<i>makes me think of this place or you. </i>

418
00:29:40,465 --> 00:29:43,750
<i>You must think l'm on a string. </i>

419
00:29:43,968 --> 00:29:45,593
<i>Go away, Veda, </i>
<i>come back, Veda. </i>

420
00:29:46,095 --> 00:29:47,506
<i>lt isn't that easy. </i>

421
00:30:03,696 --> 00:30:04,692
<i>Alone. </i>

422
00:30:06,157 --> 00:30:07,320
<i>You're alone. </i>

423
00:30:08,785 --> 00:30:11,073
<i>You've never been</i>
<i>so alone in your live. </i>

424
00:30:12,997 --> 00:30:14,824
<i>Lies are your only company. </i>

425
00:30:14,999 --> 00:30:18,036
GONE TO THE LAUNDROMAT.
WE'RE OUT FO CLEAN CLOTHES.

426
00:30:34,644 --> 00:30:37,561
- Can l get you something?
- Can l get a MoIson Canadian, pIease?

427
00:30:39,399 --> 00:30:40,264
Hi!

428
00:30:41,109 --> 00:30:42,104
Hi.

429
00:30:42,652 --> 00:30:45,143
- l haven't seen you h<i>e</i>re befor<i>e. </i>
- No.

430
00:30:47,782 --> 00:30:50,071
l'm sorry <i>a</i>bout the thing
with the braids this morning.

431
00:30:50,243 --> 00:30:52,117
l shouldn't really have sugg<i>e</i>sted it,

432
00:30:52,704 --> 00:30:55,408
but l was having
a kind of weird morning...

433
00:30:55,707 --> 00:30:56,952
you ever get those?

434
00:30:57,125 --> 00:30:59,117
You know, when youjust
can't face th<i>e</i> world?

435
00:30:59,294 --> 00:31:01,832
lt's v<i>e</i>ry stressful being
a hairdresser,

436
00:31:02,213 --> 00:31:04,040
people expect a lot from you

437
00:31:05,008 --> 00:31:07,333
and sometimes
you can't stand the pressure.

438
00:31:07,510 --> 00:31:10,345
People want you
to m<i>a</i>ke them beautiful

439
00:31:10,513 --> 00:31:13,265
but som<i>e</i>times
it's just not possible.

440
00:31:13,433 --> 00:31:14,761
You know what?
Don't worry <i>a</i>bout it,

441
00:31:14,934 --> 00:31:16,642
l wasn't h<i>a</i>ving
a great morning either, so...

442
00:31:18,563 --> 00:31:21,599
Now, can l ask you
<i>a</i> personal question?

443
00:31:23,610 --> 00:31:25,104
Do you Iik<i>e</i> Milli VaniIIi?

444
00:31:25,653 --> 00:31:28,358
You mean thos<i>e</i> guys in shorts
who didn't sing.

445
00:31:28,531 --> 00:31:29,942
Oh, you're wrong there.

446
00:31:30,283 --> 00:31:33,035
They did sing, but their produc<i>e</i>r
wouldn't let them.

447
00:31:33,453 --> 00:31:35,445
He practicaIly blackmailed them

448
00:31:35,622 --> 00:31:37,495
and said he would teII everyone
their secret,

449
00:31:37,665 --> 00:31:39,741
and he got
all the royalties.

450
00:31:40,585 --> 00:31:42,412
lt was so unfair.

451
00:31:43,046 --> 00:31:44,789
And later they showed
that they could sing,

452
00:31:44,964 --> 00:31:47,253
but you know no one listened to them.

453
00:31:48,092 --> 00:31:51,212
They w<i>e</i>re too fragile
for th<i>e</i> music industry.

454
00:31:52,555 --> 00:31:55,093
- What kind of music do you like?
- Music?

455
00:31:56,893 --> 00:31:59,300
God, l h<i>a</i>ven't Iistened to any music
in so long.

456
00:32:00,355 --> 00:32:01,600
l used to like Nirv<i>a</i>n<i>a. </i>

457
00:32:01,940 --> 00:32:03,398
l went to one of th<i>e</i>ir concerts...

458
00:32:03,566 --> 00:32:05,025
actu<i>a</i>lly it was
their last conc<i>e</i>rt.

459
00:32:05,193 --> 00:32:09,143
That's actually wher<i>e</i> l met Don,
my husband.

460
00:32:09,405 --> 00:32:10,354
He was...

461
00:32:10,531 --> 00:32:13,283
Hold th<i>a</i>t thought,
Ijust got to get up and dance.

462
00:32:13,451 --> 00:32:15,491
The DJ's <i>a</i> friend of mine.
l'll be back.

463
00:33:16,306 --> 00:33:18,797
l'm going to go get
a cup coffee next door.

464
00:33:18,975 --> 00:33:21,892
l was wondering if m<i>a</i>yb<i>e</i>
you wanted me to go and get you one too?

465
00:33:22,812 --> 00:33:23,891
No, thanks.

466
00:33:25,231 --> 00:33:27,105
Yeah, actually, please, yeah.

467
00:33:27,650 --> 00:33:29,524
Sure. Milk and sugar, ple<i>a</i>se.

468
00:33:30,153 --> 00:33:31,232
Thanks.

469
00:34:58,783 --> 00:35:00,158
Your coffee's cold.

470
00:35:00,535 --> 00:35:01,946
l w<i>a</i>s kind of tired.

471
00:35:04,080 --> 00:35:06,785
l washed,
folded your Iaundry.

472
00:35:08,585 --> 00:35:09,533
Thanks.

473
00:35:11,671 --> 00:35:13,295
l didn't forget the softener,
did l?

474
00:35:13,464 --> 00:35:15,457
No, you forgot the soap.

475
00:35:25,435 --> 00:35:27,593
Were you watching m<i>e</i>
while l w<i>a</i>s asl<i>e</i>ep?

476
00:35:28,062 --> 00:35:30,221
Y<i>e</i>ah, for a littIe whiIe. Sorry.

477
00:35:31,482 --> 00:35:32,478
Why?

478
00:35:33,985 --> 00:35:36,108
l was snoring or... ?

479
00:35:36,279 --> 00:35:39,114
No, you were drooling.
You drool when you sIe<i>e</i>p.

480
00:35:42,076 --> 00:35:43,274
Are you that girl? That girl

481
00:35:44,370 --> 00:35:45,651
at the coffee shop

482
00:35:45,830 --> 00:35:48,036
that was writing in a journ<i>a</i>l
the other day?

483
00:35:52,503 --> 00:35:54,046
Thanks for th<i>e</i> j<i>a</i>ck<i>e</i>t.

484
00:35:56,090 --> 00:35:57,122
lt's yours, isn't it?

485
00:35:57,300 --> 00:35:59,043
Yeah, you can keep it if you want.

486
00:35:59,218 --> 00:36:03,002
lt's mighty cold out there
<i>a</i>nd l'm us<i>e</i>d to it.

487
00:36:03,181 --> 00:36:06,347
I was in Alaska for three years,
l lived ther<i>e</i>, l m<i>e</i>an, two and <i>a</i> half.

488
00:36:06,517 --> 00:36:07,513
It's all right.

489
00:36:08,728 --> 00:36:11,349
l really like the cold.
lt m<i>a</i>kes me feel really alive.

490
00:36:14,901 --> 00:36:17,522
l'v<i>e</i> got to run. l'v<i>e</i> got
two young kids. You know how it is.

491
00:36:19,989 --> 00:36:20,938
Sure.

492
00:36:29,415 --> 00:36:30,197
Thanks.

493
00:36:33,628 --> 00:36:35,419
- l'll see you around.
- My name's Lee.

494
00:36:36,589 --> 00:36:37,503
Ann.

495
00:36:50,436 --> 00:36:52,180
Are you sure that
you don't need the jacket?

496
00:36:52,647 --> 00:36:54,604
No, no. Go ahead, take it.

497
00:36:56,025 --> 00:36:59,110
Okay. l've never been to Alaska.
l always really liked the sound of it.

498
00:37:00,571 --> 00:37:03,442
- l'll bring the jacket back, don't worry.
- No. l want you to have it.

499
00:37:03,908 --> 00:37:05,616
l like the idea of you we<i>a</i>ring it.

500
00:37:06,244 --> 00:37:07,358
That's nice.

501
00:37:09,205 --> 00:37:10,913
l'll bring it back, don't worry.

502
00:37:46,701 --> 00:37:48,575
<i>You see things clearly now. </i>

503
00:37:49,746 --> 00:37:52,949
<i>You see all these all these</i>
<i>borrowed lifes, borrowed voices. </i>

504
00:37:53,875 --> 00:37:55,749
<i>Milli Vanilli everywhere. </i>

505
00:37:57,378 --> 00:37:59,750
<i>You look at all the things</i>
<i>you can't buy, </i>

506
00:38:00,089 --> 00:38:02,331
<i>now you don't even</i>
<i>wanna buy. </i>

507
00:38:02,926 --> 00:38:05,677
<i>All the things that will still</i>
<i>be here after you're gone. </i>

508
00:38:06,262 --> 00:38:07,721
<i>When you're dead. </i>

509
00:38:08,723 --> 00:38:11,344
<i>And then you realize</i>
<i>that all the things</i>

510
00:38:11,517 --> 00:38:13,225
<i>in the bright window displays, </i>

511
00:38:13,770 --> 00:38:15,762
<i>all the models</i>
<i>in the catalogues, </i>

512
00:38:15,939 --> 00:38:18,560
<i>all the colours, </i>
<i>all the special offers, </i>

513
00:38:18,733 --> 00:38:20,726
<i>all the Martha Stewart</i>
<i>recipes, </i>

514
00:38:20,902 --> 00:38:23,393
<i>all the piles</i>
<i>of greasy food, </i>

515
00:38:23,988 --> 00:38:26,277
<i>it's just all thereto try</i>
<i>and keep us away from death. </i>

516
00:38:27,116 --> 00:38:28,492
<i>And it doesn't work. </i>

517
00:38:30,787 --> 00:38:33,622
So, it turns out that she loved
her daughter so much

518
00:38:33,790 --> 00:38:35,829
that she didn't tell her
that she was her mother,

519
00:38:36,000 --> 00:38:37,376
b<i>e</i>cause she didn't...

520
00:38:37,543 --> 00:38:39,619
she thought
that would be better,

521
00:38:39,796 --> 00:38:41,835
the boy's parents
would accept her better

522
00:38:42,006 --> 00:38:43,666
and the boy would ask her
to marry him,

523
00:38:43,841 --> 00:38:45,881
which was what she w<i>a</i>nted
most in the whole world.

524
00:38:46,594 --> 00:38:48,219
But it was a hug<i>e</i> sacrifice,

525
00:38:48,471 --> 00:38:50,629
and sh<i>e</i> suffered a whole lot,

526
00:38:53,268 --> 00:38:56,802
Mommy, Grandma toId us
a b<i>e</i>autiful story <i>a</i>bout a mom

527
00:38:56,980 --> 00:39:00,146
who has lots of bad things happen
to her, and it's r<i>e</i>aIIy sad.

528
00:39:00,316 --> 00:39:02,060
Goodness, how unusual.

529
00:39:04,362 --> 00:39:05,560
l bathed th<i>e</i>m

530
00:39:05,738 --> 00:39:07,778
and Penny ate thr<i>e</i>e sIic<i>e</i>s
of banana bread

531
00:39:07,949 --> 00:39:11,234
and Patsy drank some miIk.
Lately she's been kind of off it.

532
00:39:12,328 --> 00:39:14,451
Grandma's story's a movie,

533
00:39:14,622 --> 00:39:16,366
Mommy, and she says she Iik<i>e</i>s it a lot.

534
00:39:16,541 --> 00:39:18,996
- R<i>e</i>aIly?
- Yeah, Joan Crawford.

535
00:39:19,252 --> 00:39:22,169
Joan Crawford, that's gr<i>e</i>at!
Okay, let's go, guys.

536
00:39:22,338 --> 00:39:25,541
Patsy, put th<i>a</i>t down.
Patsy. We're going.

537
00:39:26,968 --> 00:39:30,467
l just wanted to keep them entertained,
you know, so they don't watch so much TV.

538
00:39:30,805 --> 00:39:32,216
N<i>e</i>xt time l'll keep my mouth shut.

539
00:39:32,390 --> 00:39:34,798
Mommy, l don't want to go
to school tomorrow.

540
00:39:34,976 --> 00:39:38,143
- l don't want to.
- l know, I know.

541
00:39:38,855 --> 00:39:40,894
l said thanks, okay?
So just drop it.

542
00:39:41,065 --> 00:39:44,232
- I don't need your thanks.
- Okay, so l'll take them back then.

543
00:39:45,069 --> 00:39:48,319
All l did was watch your kids
while you did your shopping.

544
00:39:48,489 --> 00:39:49,687
You asked me to.

545
00:39:49,866 --> 00:39:52,072
Ye<i>a</i>h, l asked you to.
l didn't ask you to fill their heads

546
00:39:52,243 --> 00:39:55,493
with stupid stories <i>a</i>bout mothers
m<i>a</i>king dumb-ass sacrifices.

547
00:39:56,080 --> 00:39:58,037
What kind of stories
do you want me to tell th<i>e</i>m?

548
00:39:58,207 --> 00:40:00,449
Cinderella?
About murderous step-mothers?

549
00:40:00,627 --> 00:40:02,536
- ls that what you want?
- Y<i>e</i>s!

550
00:40:05,965 --> 00:40:08,421
There's times th<i>a</i>t you're
just like your father,

551
00:40:08,593 --> 00:40:10,336
<i>a</i>nd let me tell you,
it's not something I like.

552
00:40:10,511 --> 00:40:12,089
You're wrong, there's times
th<i>a</i>t l'm just like you,

553
00:40:12,263 --> 00:40:13,923
and it's not something l like either.

554
00:40:25,443 --> 00:40:27,768
I'm sorry, it's just really tangled.

555
00:40:28,321 --> 00:40:30,112
P<i>a</i>tsy's aIways whining.

556
00:40:30,323 --> 00:40:32,316
Penny, please don't pick on her.

557
00:40:32,492 --> 00:40:34,947
You always complain
when l brush your hair too.

558
00:40:35,119 --> 00:40:37,077
- Why do you hav<i>e</i> to do that?
- l wasn't picking on her.

559
00:40:37,246 --> 00:40:38,954
And telling me
that she's always complaining,

560
00:40:39,123 --> 00:40:40,534
that's not picking on her?
l think so.

561
00:40:40,708 --> 00:40:42,535
l wasn't picking on her.

562
00:40:43,962 --> 00:40:45,753
l'm not always complaining.

563
00:40:45,922 --> 00:40:47,749
Okay, that's enough, guys.

564
00:40:48,091 --> 00:40:49,668
Go to bed, ok<i>a</i>y?

565
00:40:52,929 --> 00:40:55,135
Okay, good night, monk<i>e</i>y girl.
You got kitty?

566
00:40:55,431 --> 00:40:58,136
- Yeah.
- Ther<i>e</i> you go. You've got some covers.

567
00:40:58,309 --> 00:41:00,979
'Night, buddy.
You don't want me to kiss you?

568
00:41:01,145 --> 00:41:02,177
l wasn't picking on her.

569
00:41:02,355 --> 00:41:05,142
Penny, that is <i>e</i>nough,
l said, okay?

570
00:41:10,238 --> 00:41:12,277
lt's true you're just
like Grandma.

571
00:41:18,705 --> 00:41:20,781
H<i>e</i>y. Do you want some leftover chicken?

572
00:41:23,126 --> 00:41:24,501
Ar<i>e</i>n't you going to say hello?

573
00:41:27,463 --> 00:41:29,171
How many beers hav<i>e</i> you had?

574
00:41:30,800 --> 00:41:32,709
WeII, one or two or...

575
00:41:33,886 --> 00:41:35,262
four. l don't know.

576
00:41:37,807 --> 00:41:41,141
- You want some chicken or don't you?
- l want a kiss.

577
00:41:42,645 --> 00:41:45,432
l want a big, juicy kiss.

578
00:41:49,819 --> 00:41:51,194
Here's some chicken.

579
00:41:57,035 --> 00:41:58,908
Great. Chicken.

580
00:42:05,960 --> 00:42:07,205
lt's good.

581
00:42:07,962 --> 00:42:09,540
Have the girIs been
in bed long?

582
00:42:09,964 --> 00:42:11,340
Yeah, a littl<i>e</i> whil<i>e. </i>

583
00:42:13,217 --> 00:42:14,795
Penny's was picking
on Patsy again.

584
00:42:14,969 --> 00:42:17,009
l told her not to
and she got kind of mad at me.

585
00:42:17,180 --> 00:42:18,804
- She did?
- Ye<i>a</i>h, a little bit.

586
00:42:19,849 --> 00:42:21,889
We started
a pool out at Rushmore tod<i>a</i>y.

587
00:42:22,060 --> 00:42:24,729
- Oh yeah?
- Ye<i>a</i>h. lt's crescent-sh<i>a</i>p<i>e</i>d.

588
00:42:25,355 --> 00:42:26,813
lt's going to look wild.

589
00:42:27,023 --> 00:42:30,059
These people,
they got a thr<i>e</i>e-story hous<i>e</i>,

590
00:42:30,234 --> 00:42:32,808
a porch out of "Gone With th<i>e</i> Wind"
<i>a</i>nd everything.

591
00:42:33,404 --> 00:42:34,567
lt's beautiful.

592
00:42:35,073 --> 00:42:36,318
Are you happy?

593
00:42:37,450 --> 00:42:39,490
With th<i>e</i> swimming pool thing, l mean.

594
00:42:39,661 --> 00:42:40,906
Yeah, it's good.

595
00:42:41,621 --> 00:42:45,369
lt's not like th<i>e</i> factory
but it's b<i>e</i>tt<i>e</i>r than nothing.

596
00:42:46,042 --> 00:42:47,620
l'm going to get to work.

597
00:42:48,086 --> 00:42:50,755
You not just going to l<i>e</i>ave m<i>e</i> here alone
gn<i>a</i>wing on a coId chicken bone, ar<i>e</i> you?

598
00:42:50,922 --> 00:42:54,540
lf you like you can always heat it up,
but l thought you really loved cold food.

599
00:42:54,717 --> 00:42:56,757
Why don't you just eat it cold?

600
00:43:04,102 --> 00:43:05,512
Will you sing to me?

601
00:43:05,687 --> 00:43:07,062
No, l have to go to work.

602
00:43:07,230 --> 00:43:09,436
You know how much l love it
wh<i>e</i>n you sing to me.

603
00:43:09,774 --> 00:43:10,937
Please.

604
00:43:11,276 --> 00:43:12,604
Just sing to m<i>e. </i>

605
00:43:45,310 --> 00:43:46,305
Hi.

606
00:43:46,936 --> 00:43:47,718
Hi.

607
00:43:48,980 --> 00:43:50,095
Bye...

608
00:43:51,274 --> 00:43:52,305
Bye...

609
00:44:12,629 --> 00:44:14,171
Hey, my buddy Penny.

610
00:44:16,424 --> 00:44:18,167
l'm not going to be
at your birthday p<i>a</i>rty,

611
00:44:18,343 --> 00:44:21,213
but there's nothing l'd like more
in the whole, wide world.

612
00:44:23,097 --> 00:44:25,469
l bet Gr<i>a</i>ndm<i>a</i>'s m<i>a</i>d<i>e a</i> sp<i>e</i>cial
birthday cake just for

613
00:44:25,642 --> 00:44:27,800
you with your name on it
in big chocolate Ietters.

614
00:44:34,192 --> 00:44:37,228
Penny, l w<i>a</i>nt you to know
that th<i>e</i> day that you were born

615
00:44:38,446 --> 00:44:39,940
I held you in my arms

616
00:44:40,114 --> 00:44:42,784
and that was the happiest d<i>a</i>y
in my whole life.

617
00:44:45,328 --> 00:44:47,866
l was so happy
l couIdn't even speak.

618
00:44:50,208 --> 00:44:53,374
l just strok<i>e</i>d your tiny little feet
and l cried with h<i>a</i>ppiness.

619
00:44:54,295 --> 00:44:57,082
Without you l could have never found out
that lions e<i>a</i>t pancakes

620
00:44:57,256 --> 00:44:59,463
or that the b<i>e</i>d
could be a raft.

621
00:44:59,926 --> 00:45:02,168
Try and look after Patsy, okay?

622
00:45:06,683 --> 00:45:09,719
l know it's hard 'caus<i>e</i> sometimes
sh<i>e</i> mak<i>e</i>s you mad and ev<i>e</i>rything.

623
00:45:11,271 --> 00:45:14,853
l know it's not easy being a big sister,
but l know that you can do it, okay?

624
00:45:18,278 --> 00:45:20,685
Mommy sends you millions
and millions of kiss<i>e</i>s.

625
00:45:36,963 --> 00:45:39,169
H<i>a</i>ppy birthday,
my darling Iittle Patsy.

626
00:45:40,174 --> 00:45:41,717
Now you're fiv<i>e</i>!

627
00:45:42,093 --> 00:45:44,251
I'II b<i>e</i>t that Penny Iooks after you now.

628
00:45:44,846 --> 00:45:46,922
l bet that sh<i>e</i> doesn't pick
on you anymore.

629
00:45:48,516 --> 00:45:51,517
Honey, l don't want you to be sad
that l'm not at your birthday, okay?

630
00:45:51,686 --> 00:45:52,849
Promise?

631
00:45:53,896 --> 00:45:56,566
l remember your first birthday
really well, you know?

632
00:45:56,774 --> 00:46:00,190
l remember how you start<i>e</i>d to cry

633
00:46:00,361 --> 00:46:03,777
and you wouldn't stop b<i>e</i>caus<i>e</i> you didn't
like how w<i>e</i> were singing "Happy Birthday".

634
00:46:04,616 --> 00:46:07,285
Every time we started to sing,
you'd just scream and yell

635
00:46:07,452 --> 00:46:09,943
because you didn't Iik<i>e</i>
how we were singing.

636
00:46:14,250 --> 00:46:15,875
Happy birthday, my little buddy.

637
00:46:18,338 --> 00:46:19,998
Mommy loves you to bits.

638
00:46:27,680 --> 00:46:29,388
Buddy, I want you to be happy.

639
00:46:29,807 --> 00:46:31,883
l know sometim<i>e</i>s
it's not easy 'c<i>a</i>use

640
00:46:32,810 --> 00:46:34,518
sometimes things happen

641
00:46:35,229 --> 00:46:37,305
and people aren't always
like you want them to be.

642
00:46:37,482 --> 00:46:40,233
Talk to your Dad
if there's things bothering you, okay?

643
00:46:40,401 --> 00:46:41,943
He knows more
than you'd think, s<i>e</i>riously,

644
00:46:42,111 --> 00:46:44,781
if th<i>e</i>re's something bothering you
and you're not sure about something,

645
00:46:44,948 --> 00:46:48,447
just ask him and he'll t<i>e</i>ll you.
Grandma knows a lot of things, too.

646
00:46:48,701 --> 00:46:50,824
l r<i>e</i>aIIy hope
she'll <i>e</i>xplain them to you.

647
00:46:51,287 --> 00:46:53,825
Try and be patient with her, OK?

648
00:46:54,082 --> 00:46:57,533
She is a good person, <i>e</i>ven if sometimes
it doesn't always seem that way...

649
00:47:00,672 --> 00:47:03,791
None of the things she's aIways dr<i>e</i>am<i>e</i>d
about ever c<i>a</i>me true, you know?

650
00:47:03,967 --> 00:47:06,884
Try and understand her.
Don't let her make you mad.

651
00:47:12,558 --> 00:47:16,058
lf you g<i>e</i>t a n<i>e</i>w Mom,
try and love her, okay?

652
00:47:16,854 --> 00:47:19,642
Don't make life impossibIe for her
just out of some loyalty to me

653
00:47:19,816 --> 00:47:20,847
or something like that.

654
00:47:21,401 --> 00:47:22,231
Just l don't know...

655
00:47:23,861 --> 00:47:25,320
l know it's not the sam<i>e. </i>

656
00:47:31,661 --> 00:47:34,282
... and wh<i>a</i>tev<i>e</i>r happens,
you finish school,

657
00:47:34,789 --> 00:47:36,663
even if you think it sucks,
and you don't know

658
00:47:36,958 --> 00:47:39,627
if you can take it anymore,
you just finish school.

659
00:47:42,088 --> 00:47:44,626
l'd lik<i>e</i> to be able to tell you
stuff about boys

660
00:47:45,800 --> 00:47:49,584
and boyfri<i>e</i>nds and relationships
and that kind of stuff,

661
00:47:50,555 --> 00:47:53,556
l think
l wouldn't b<i>e</i> much heIp.

662
00:47:54,183 --> 00:47:56,556
l was s<i>e</i>vente<i>e</i>n
when you were born, Penny,

663
00:47:57,437 --> 00:47:59,429
exactly how old
you are right now.

664
00:48:00,565 --> 00:48:02,439
You hav<i>e</i> to have f<i>a</i>ith in yourself.

665
00:48:03,109 --> 00:48:05,600
You have to have f<i>a</i>ith
in your ability to do things,

666
00:48:05,778 --> 00:48:07,189
to just mak<i>e</i> a go of it.

667
00:48:08,948 --> 00:48:10,857
Lots of kisses and cuddl<i>e</i>s,

668
00:48:12,702 --> 00:48:15,275
even though l know you're not
a small little thing anymore.

669
00:48:57,622 --> 00:48:58,737
Ann, is something wrong?

670
00:49:01,376 --> 00:49:02,538
What is it?

671
00:49:03,628 --> 00:49:05,252
ls it that diet you're on?

672
00:49:22,438 --> 00:49:24,098
How come you're throwing up?

673
00:49:25,316 --> 00:49:27,356
You're not taking
thos<i>e</i> slimming pills, are you?

674
00:49:28,820 --> 00:49:30,195
You want to know why l'm throwing up?

675
00:49:34,701 --> 00:49:36,195
You really want to know?

676
00:49:39,580 --> 00:49:41,490
l'm throwing up because
when l was eight years old

677
00:49:41,666 --> 00:49:45,284
the girl who was supposed to be my best
friend toId <i>e</i>veryone l was a slut.

678
00:49:46,713 --> 00:49:48,504
I'm throwing up 'cause
when l was fifteen years oId

679
00:49:48,673 --> 00:49:52,208
l didn't get invited to the only party
l ever wanted to go to in my entire life.

680
00:49:53,428 --> 00:49:55,385
l'm throwing up because when
l was seventeen l had my first kid

681
00:49:55,555 --> 00:49:57,713
and l had to grow up
overnight.

682
00:49:58,016 --> 00:49:59,676
And l've got no more dreams.

683
00:50:00,268 --> 00:50:02,723
Without dre<i>a</i>ms
you can't fucking live.

684
00:50:05,565 --> 00:50:08,815
l'm throwing up because sinc<i>e</i> they put
my dad in jail l haven't seen him.

685
00:50:09,569 --> 00:50:10,849
l don't have anything from him,

686
00:50:11,029 --> 00:50:12,938
I don't even h<i>a</i>ve
a single fucking postcard.

687
00:50:15,366 --> 00:50:18,533
And in all the commercials
everybody is so fucking happy

688
00:50:18,703 --> 00:50:21,787
and <i>a</i>ll day long my two littIe daughters
sing those stupid fucking songs

689
00:50:21,956 --> 00:50:24,115
from those stupid fucking commercials.

690
00:50:31,424 --> 00:50:32,799
lf l beg you,

691
00:50:33,468 --> 00:50:36,006
if l g<i>e</i>t down on my knees
to beg you...

692
00:50:39,140 --> 00:50:42,924
please, don't give me the name
of that diet you're on.

693
00:50:54,781 --> 00:50:57,354
l didn't wake you up, did I?

694
00:50:58,868 --> 00:51:00,197
lt's Ann.

695
00:51:02,580 --> 00:51:04,288
Can l bring you back
your book now?

696
00:51:06,751 --> 00:51:08,126
Yeah, right now.

697
00:51:09,587 --> 00:51:11,461
Yeah, ok<i>a</i>y, l know where that is.

698
00:51:20,932 --> 00:51:23,008
l should have given you
a raincoat. Come on in.

699
00:51:27,563 --> 00:51:30,517
- lt's got a bit w<i>e</i>t.
- Don't worry about it.

700
00:51:36,489 --> 00:51:37,817
What happened?

701
00:51:39,075 --> 00:51:41,992
You didn't keep up the p<i>a</i>yments on your
furniture and they took it <i>a</i>ll away?

702
00:51:44,372 --> 00:51:45,321
No.

703
00:51:46,791 --> 00:51:48,534
Well, actuaIIy, I was

704
00:51:50,336 --> 00:51:52,910
pIanning on getting
some furniture on<i>e</i> day,

705
00:51:53,089 --> 00:51:54,714
l just didn't re<i>a</i>lly hav<i>e</i> the time.

706
00:51:58,344 --> 00:52:02,212
Sorry, l'd off<i>e</i>r you something,
but l don't have anything.

707
00:52:03,599 --> 00:52:05,473
l don't ev<i>e</i>n have any gl<i>a</i>ss<i>e</i>s.

708
00:52:06,561 --> 00:52:08,850
Not even like a cookie or something?

709
00:52:10,023 --> 00:52:11,221
Nothing.

710
00:52:13,568 --> 00:52:16,485
if I kn<i>e</i>w you wer<i>e</i> coming,
l would have bought something.

711
00:52:19,157 --> 00:52:20,984
l can live without cookies.

712
00:52:23,411 --> 00:52:24,870
Who took
all your furnitur<i>e</i>?

713
00:52:27,915 --> 00:52:29,078
Someone...

714
00:52:30,877 --> 00:52:32,075
took it... yeah.

715
00:52:32,920 --> 00:52:36,289
You don't w<i>a</i>nt to get anymore
because you think she might come back?

716
00:52:48,770 --> 00:52:50,098
You wanna sit down?

717
00:52:57,403 --> 00:52:58,067
Thanks.

718
00:53:02,450 --> 00:53:03,861
Are they okay?

719
00:53:10,333 --> 00:53:11,911
What did you do in Alaska?

720
00:53:13,503 --> 00:53:14,701
l'm a surveyor.

721
00:53:14,879 --> 00:53:18,747

bridges and things like that.

722
00:53:20,301 --> 00:53:22,045

00:53:39,570 --> 00:53:40,851
Penny and P<i>a</i>tsy.

729

Would you Iik<i>e</i> to see a photograph?

730
00:53:46,995 --> 00:53:47,943
Okay.

731

Th<i>e</i>y look h<i>a</i>ppy.

732
00:54:02,260 --> 00:54:03,671
They look like you.

733
00:54:04,929 --> 00:54:06,304
Do l look happy?

734
00:54:07,015 --> 00:54:08,129
Not happy.

735
00:54:09,309 --> 00:54:10,554
You look beautiful.

736
00:54:11,769 --> 00:54:13,311
You look like your girls.

737
00:54:19,694 --> 00:54:21,153
You've been thinking about me?

738
00:54:26,284 --> 00:54:27,233
Yeah.

739
00:54:28,995 --> 00:54:30,988
I've been thinking about you a lot.

740
00:54:33,416 --> 00:54:34,531
Too much.

741
00:54:53,019 --> 00:54:56,020
l'v<i>e</i> got a sister, you know, who...

742
00:54:57,315 --> 00:54:59,888
sh<i>e</i> works for this radio
company up north.

743
00:55:02,362 --> 00:55:05,528
And she makes these tapes for me
that she sends to me,

744
00:55:05,698 --> 00:55:09,114

746
00:55:11,621 --> 00:55:13,530
out in my car right now.

747
00:55:15,208 --> 00:55:16,999
We could go listen to it,

748
00:55:17,794 --> 00:55:18,992
if you want...

749
00:56:25,862 --> 00:56:28,567
lf you don't kiss me right now,
l'm going to scream.

750
00:56:38,958 --> 00:56:39,788
Shut up!

751
00:57:02,565 --> 00:57:05,317
lf you don't kiss me right now,
l'm goinna fucking scream.

752
00:57:29,592 --> 00:57:30,458
Hello, Ann.

753
00:57:31,094 --> 00:57:33,798
This some kind of therapy
to get over your shyness?

754
00:57:33,972 --> 00:57:35,134
Something like that.

755
00:57:36,891 --> 00:57:38,551
So you didn't come Iast we<i>e</i>k.

756
00:57:40,061 --> 00:57:41,970
Th<i>e</i>re didn't seem to be a Iot of point.

757
00:57:43,064 --> 00:57:46,729
l have to give you <i>a</i> further scan
and <i>a</i> fuller biopsy.

758
00:57:47,360 --> 00:57:48,605
No, l'm sorry.

759
00:57:49,195 --> 00:57:51,152
l don't want any of those things, okay?

760
00:57:51,614 --> 00:57:54,817
I ne<i>e</i>d to feel
like l'v<i>e</i> got some control.

761
00:57:56,786 --> 00:57:58,992
So l don't w<i>a</i>nt any more tests
if they're not going to save me.

762
00:57:59,163 --> 00:58:00,990
l don't want to di<i>e</i> here.

763
00:58:01,165 --> 00:58:04,083
l will not have the only thing my kids
remember about me be a hospital ward.

764
00:58:05,211 --> 00:58:06,789
So why are you here?

765
00:58:10,591 --> 00:58:12,299
lt's this package.

766
00:58:14,095 --> 00:58:15,886
l want you to Iook <i>a</i>fter it for me.

767
00:58:16,180 --> 00:58:17,461
l don't know. What is it?

768
00:58:17,807 --> 00:58:20,594
l've recorded birthday m<i>e</i>ss<i>a</i>g<i>e</i>s
for both of my daughters,

769
00:58:20,768 --> 00:58:22,642
for every birthday
till they're eighteen.

770
00:58:23,313 --> 00:58:25,186
And you want me
to give these, don't you?

771
00:58:28,151 --> 00:58:29,775
Why don't you ask your husband?

772
00:58:30,194 --> 00:58:31,190
'Caus<i>e... </i>

773
00:58:33,156 --> 00:58:35,729
'cause Don, you know, he'd Iose them

774
00:58:36,367 --> 00:58:39,154
or maybe he'd give them to them next year,
and maybe the year after that,

775
00:58:39,329 --> 00:58:41,321
or maybe he'd give them to th<i>e</i>m
all at onc<i>e. </i>

776
00:58:41,623 --> 00:58:43,948
They wouldn't understand
a thing if he did that,

777
00:58:44,125 --> 00:58:45,952
so... please tell me
you'll do it, please.

778
00:58:47,712 --> 00:58:49,586
l'll only do it
if you promise to com<i>e</i> here

779
00:58:49,756 --> 00:58:52,044
every week
and l have to give you medication.

780
00:58:52,216 --> 00:58:55,716
l would imagine that the n<i>a</i>usea's
got worse, you're not eating.

781
00:58:55,887 --> 00:58:58,294
Dying's not as easy as it looks.

782
00:58:58,473 --> 00:59:02,340
But there's no ne<i>e</i>d for you to have
to fe<i>e</i>l terrible all the time.

783
00:59:03,686 --> 00:59:04,600
lt's just...

784
00:59:05,897 --> 00:59:07,011
lt's just l'm kind of afraid

785
00:59:07,190 --> 00:59:09,763
I'm going to come in her<i>e</i> one d<i>a</i>y
and l'm never gonna leave...

786
00:59:11,778 --> 00:59:14,399
and l've got to so much
I have to do before l di<i>e</i>,

787
00:59:14,572 --> 00:59:16,363
l h<i>a</i>ve so many things l have to do.

788
00:59:16,532 --> 00:59:17,777
l have to do them, or...

789
00:59:18,409 --> 00:59:20,449
lt'Il only bejust som<i>e</i> painkillers.

790
00:59:20,745 --> 00:59:24,446
l promise we won't do any more tests,
just something to ease the pain.

791
00:59:25,541 --> 00:59:26,704
And anyway...

792
00:59:29,462 --> 00:59:31,087
l brought you some candies.

793
00:59:32,966 --> 00:59:35,670
- So you'll look after it for me?
- Of course.

794
00:59:36,219 --> 00:59:39,339
L<i>e</i>t's just say it's part
of your ther<i>a</i>py.

795
00:59:45,645 --> 00:59:47,637
God. These candies are so good.

796
00:59:55,738 --> 00:59:56,901
l don't g<i>e</i>t it.

797
00:59:57,073 --> 01:00:00,406
I've been counting my caIories tod<i>a</i>y,
and l c<i>a</i>n't h<i>a</i>ve eaten more than 1500,

798
01:00:00,576 --> 01:00:03,945
and in theory l need 2000,
so in theory l shouId hav<i>e</i> lost weight,

799
01:00:04,163 --> 01:00:06,286
and l just weighed mys<i>e</i>lf
before l left th<i>e</i> house

800
01:00:06,457 --> 01:00:08,865
and l weigh nearIy a pound
mor<i>e</i> th<i>a</i>n l did yesterday.

801
01:00:09,210 --> 01:00:11,119
lt must be my metabolism.

802
01:00:11,421 --> 01:00:14,624
They should give us compensation
for slow met<i>a</i>bolisms,

803
01:00:15,633 --> 01:00:17,211
give us some kind of allowance.

804
01:00:18,970 --> 01:00:20,844
Laurie, you want to come over
for dinner tomorrow night?

805
01:00:22,307 --> 01:00:23,505
Yeah, l'd love to.

806
01:00:24,142 --> 01:00:24,841
Great.

807
01:00:25,143 --> 01:00:26,257
Diet food, l hope.

808
01:00:26,686 --> 01:00:28,310
l don't want to ruin my diet.

809
01:00:36,446 --> 01:00:39,530
<i>lt's cold in the supermarket, </i>
<i>and you like it like that. </i>

810
01:00:40,658 --> 01:00:43,825
<i>People always read the labels of their</i>
<i>favourite brands really really carefully</i>

811
01:00:43,995 --> 01:00:46,118
<i>just to see how many chemicals</i>
<i>they have, </i>

812
01:00:46,623 --> 01:00:48,864
<i>and then they just sigh</i>
<i>and they put them in their cartanyway, </i>

813
01:00:49,042 --> 01:00:50,915
<i>like they're saying sure</i>
<i>it's bad for me, </i>

814
01:00:51,085 --> 01:00:52,793
<i>it's bad for my family but we like it. </i>

815
01:00:53,921 --> 01:00:56,294
<i>No one ever thinks</i>
<i>about death in a supermarket. </i>

816
01:01:29,749 --> 01:01:32,287
Sixty dollars and forty eight cents.

817
01:01:34,963 --> 01:01:37,454
Girls, you finish
those mashed potatoes, okay?

818
01:01:39,425 --> 01:01:41,382
Oh, God. Th<i>e</i>se ribs are so great.

819
01:01:41,928 --> 01:01:45,012
How did you get them
so tender?

820
01:01:45,181 --> 01:01:48,217
l leav<i>e</i> them soaking in my fridge
in milk for a coupl<i>e</i> of hours.

821
01:01:48,393 --> 01:01:51,975
You leav<i>e</i> them soaking in milk
in th<i>e</i> fridge for a couple of hours.

822
01:01:52,939 --> 01:01:54,563
l must try and remember that.

823
01:01:55,233 --> 01:01:57,356
Patsy, stop playing with your food.

824
01:01:59,612 --> 01:02:01,356
Ann, t<i>e</i>ll P<i>a</i>tsy to stop playing
with her food.

825
01:02:01,531 --> 01:02:04,532
You do what your Dad tells you to do,
okay? Stop pIaying with your food.

826
01:02:04,701 --> 01:02:05,899
Try and e<i>a</i>t a littIe more.

827
01:02:06,077 --> 01:02:08,200
lt's more fun pl<i>a</i>ying with it
than eating it.

828
01:02:08,663 --> 01:02:09,908
You know

829
01:02:10,081 --> 01:02:13,035
that eating food can be fun too?

830
01:02:13,251 --> 01:02:14,531
Why?

831
01:02:15,086 --> 01:02:16,545
Well because...

832
01:02:17,630 --> 01:02:20,086
because you're doing new things,

833
01:02:20,258 --> 01:02:23,010
you'r<i>e</i> trying new things
<i>a</i>nd that's fun.

834
01:02:23,177 --> 01:02:25,668
Mashed potatoes isn't new.
lt's mor<i>e</i> fun doing things with it.

835
01:02:25,847 --> 01:02:28,468
Laurie, why don't you hav<i>e</i>
some more sauce?

836
01:02:28,641 --> 01:02:30,266
Here, Don made it himself.

837
01:02:30,643 --> 01:02:31,888
Goodness me.

838
01:02:32,061 --> 01:02:33,935
l didn't know your husb<i>a</i>nd cooked.

839
01:02:36,107 --> 01:02:39,808
l didn't know there w<i>e</i>re husbands
th<i>a</i>t cooked.

840
01:02:41,237 --> 01:02:42,731
lt w<i>a</i>sn't really cooking.

841
01:02:42,905 --> 01:02:44,779
l just added honey
to a bottle of barbecue sauce.

842
01:02:44,949 --> 01:02:46,823
Well th<i>a</i>t's better than nothing.

843
01:02:47,243 --> 01:02:50,244
You could have lied,
s<i>a</i>id you m<i>a</i>d<i>e</i> the whole thing.

844
01:02:51,164 --> 01:02:53,489
No, Don would never li<i>e. </i>
He wouldn't even know how.

845
01:02:55,585 --> 01:02:57,293
How did you two guys meet?

846
01:02:58,338 --> 01:02:59,796
We met at a Nirvana concert.

847
01:03:00,214 --> 01:03:01,922
ActualIy
it was the last Nirvana concert

848
01:03:02,091 --> 01:03:03,669
before Kurt Cobain...

849
01:03:03,843 --> 01:03:05,468
No, my God.

850
01:03:05,637 --> 01:03:09,255
Did you save the tickets?
They must be worth a fortune by now.

851
01:03:09,724 --> 01:03:11,099
No, no we didn't save them.

852
01:03:11,267 --> 01:03:14,517
No, we were sort of too excited
to keep them.

853
01:03:14,687 --> 01:03:16,596
Ann spent the whole concert crying.

854
01:03:17,982 --> 01:03:20,271
l didn't re<i>a</i>lly like Nirvana back then,

855
01:03:20,568 --> 01:03:22,810
so I was this kind of bored
and l was looking around,

856
01:03:23,863 --> 01:03:25,488
and th<i>a</i>t's wh<i>e</i>n l saw Ann.

857
01:03:26,741 --> 01:03:29,695
She w<i>a</i>s this beautiful girl
just crying her <i>e</i>yes out,

858
01:03:30,453 --> 01:03:32,991
so l went up to her
and l offered her a h<i>a</i>ndkerchief,

859
01:03:33,164 --> 01:03:34,789
but l didn't have a handkerchief,

860
01:03:35,333 --> 01:03:37,242
l didn't even have a paper one,
so l just...

861
01:03:37,418 --> 01:03:40,668
l took off my T-shirt
and I gav<i>e</i> it to her.

862
01:03:42,715 --> 01:03:43,960
Thats how we met.

863
01:03:44,300 --> 01:03:45,711
That's really romantic.

864
01:03:48,471 --> 01:03:51,342
- Do you have any more mash<i>e</i>d potato?
- Yeah, sure.

865
01:03:56,437 --> 01:03:57,517
You're a pig.

866
01:04:00,608 --> 01:04:02,850
She's basically a nice person,
you know?

867
01:04:03,027 --> 01:04:04,190
Oh Christ, Ann.

868
01:04:04,362 --> 01:04:05,940
Don't talk so Ioud.

869
01:04:06,114 --> 01:04:07,524
Penny's right.

870
01:04:08,241 --> 01:04:10,364
l mean, the woman ate eight ribs.

871
01:04:10,535 --> 01:04:13,452
And they were fucking hug<i>e</i> ribs.
Did you see those things?

872
01:04:13,621 --> 01:04:14,652
l know, but...

873
01:04:15,957 --> 01:04:17,332
Fucking huge.

874
01:04:17,500 --> 01:04:19,956
Her fianc dumped her
the day b<i>e</i>fore her wedding, you know.

875
01:04:20,128 --> 01:04:23,544
He invited h<i>e</i>r to an All You Can Eat
and they want<i>e</i>d to charge her triple?

876
01:04:24,549 --> 01:04:27,300
Th<i>a</i>t's not funny, Don.
That's not funny.

877
01:04:27,593 --> 01:04:30,429
Food can be fun.

878
01:04:31,681 --> 01:04:33,638
Food can be fun.

879
01:04:34,767 --> 01:04:37,554
Sh<i>e</i>'s a really nice person.

880
01:04:39,689 --> 01:04:41,646
Lately she's got this obsession.

881
01:04:43,609 --> 01:04:45,851
Yeah, lately you seem to have
the opposite.

882
01:04:47,572 --> 01:04:48,402
lt's the anaemia.

883
01:04:48,573 --> 01:04:51,574
Gonna go get more vitamins this week,
go to the hospit<i>a</i>l.

884
01:04:52,410 --> 01:04:53,869
Do you want me to come with you?

885
01:04:55,621 --> 01:04:57,448
No, don't worry, l can m<i>a</i>n<i>a</i>g<i>e. </i>

886
01:04:58,541 --> 01:04:59,537
Ok.

887
01:05:04,839 --> 01:05:08,457
Tonight l re<i>a</i>liz<i>e</i>d how lucky we were
to me<i>e</i>t that night.

888
01:05:10,094 --> 01:05:11,589
l me<i>a</i>n, in spite of everything,

889
01:05:13,598 --> 01:05:15,721
in spite of living in this shit hole,

890
01:05:17,352 --> 01:05:19,391
in spite of nev<i>e</i>r having anything new,

891
01:05:20,980 --> 01:05:23,187
in spite of n<i>e</i>ver going
on vacation.

892
01:05:27,362 --> 01:05:28,856
You never compIained once,

893
01:05:31,115 --> 01:05:32,230
not once.

894
01:05:40,041 --> 01:05:41,204
l would...

895
01:05:45,838 --> 01:05:47,630
l would like to be better for you.

896
01:06:00,853 --> 01:06:02,312
l lov<i>e</i> you, you know that?

897
01:06:05,274 --> 01:06:06,817
Don't you ev<i>e</i>r forget that.

898
01:06:11,114 --> 01:06:12,359
l love you.

899
01:06:18,663 --> 01:06:19,861
Wh<i>a</i>t are you doing?

900
01:06:20,498 --> 01:06:21,661
I'm sweeping up.

901
01:06:23,001 --> 01:06:25,326
- What <i>a</i>re you doing?
- l'm the queen witch

902
01:06:25,503 --> 01:06:28,255
and l'm teaching this little witch
how to make spells.

903
01:06:28,423 --> 01:06:30,546
- I'm the littl<i>e</i> witch.
- Really?

904
01:06:30,717 --> 01:06:32,756
And what kind of spells
are you doing?

905
01:06:33,052 --> 01:06:34,677
Oh, just normal spells,

906
01:06:34,846 --> 01:06:38,546
turning frogs into cars
and turning lizards into airplanes.

907
01:06:38,975 --> 01:06:40,599
You know how to do th<i>a</i>t?

908
01:06:40,768 --> 01:06:42,097
- Are you going to teach me?
- Sure!

909
01:06:44,147 --> 01:06:44,929
Hi, there.

910
01:06:45,106 --> 01:06:46,221
l'm Ann.

911
01:06:46,566 --> 01:06:48,724
l see you've already met
Penny and P<i>a</i>tsy.

912
01:06:48,901 --> 01:06:50,526
- Yeah. l'm also Ann.
- Oh yeah?

913
01:06:50,695 --> 01:06:52,652
Ther<i>e</i> you go.
Nice to me<i>e</i>t you.

914
01:06:52,822 --> 01:06:55,609
- So you just moved in or<i>. . </i>?
- Ye<i>a</i>h, a few days ago.

915
01:06:55,783 --> 01:06:58,405
l was just trying to do som<i>e</i> gardening
or som<i>e</i>thing.

916
01:06:58,578 --> 01:07:00,535
- Looks great.
- They're so swe<i>e</i>t.

917
01:07:02,290 --> 01:07:03,914
Their littl<i>e</i> gets ups on.

918
01:07:04,083 --> 01:07:05,412
Listen,
this is kind of a weird question

919
01:07:05,585 --> 01:07:07,044
since we just m<i>e</i>t and ev<i>e</i>rything,
but l was wondering,

920
01:07:07,211 --> 01:07:09,916
l'm just h<i>e</i>ading out for about half
an hour'cause both my husband

921
01:07:10,298 --> 01:07:12,172
and my mom aren't back yet.

922
01:07:12,342 --> 01:07:13,752
l was wondering if there was any chance
of you keeping an <i>e</i>ye on them

923
01:07:13,926 --> 01:07:14,922
for the n<i>e</i>xt half hour if you're around.

924
01:07:15,094 --> 01:07:16,470
- Of course. No problem.
- Ar<i>e</i> you sure?

925
01:07:16,638 --> 01:07:18,345
Yeah, l'm going to b<i>e</i> here all day

926
01:07:18,514 --> 01:07:20,174
<i>a</i>nd they were going to show me
how to do some speIls, so...

927
01:07:20,350 --> 01:07:22,638
Ther<i>e</i> you go.
They're v<i>e</i>ry good at speIIs, so...

928
01:07:22,810 --> 01:07:24,353
- Okay.
- Th<i>a</i>nks a lot.

929
01:07:24,520 --> 01:07:26,560
Bye, guys.
You b<i>e</i>h<i>a</i>ve yourselves, okay?

930
01:07:27,231 --> 01:07:29,307
Ann's gonna watch you for a Iittle bit.

931
01:07:29,484 --> 01:07:31,607
- Th<i>a</i>nk you so much.
- lt's okay.

932
01:07:33,946 --> 01:07:36,651
So, help me here.
Who's Patsy and who's Penny?

933
01:07:51,547 --> 01:07:54,335
My body hurt
thinking you w<i>e</i>ren't gonn<i>a</i> come.

934
01:07:55,426 --> 01:07:56,707
l w<i>a</i>sn't gonna come.

935
01:07:58,012 --> 01:08:00,052
l'm glad you did.

936
01:08:06,521 --> 01:08:07,932
ls this one of your sister's tapes?

937
01:08:08,106 --> 01:08:08,936
Yeah.

938
01:08:12,527 --> 01:08:13,807
Would you like to danc<i>e</i>?

939
01:09:05,330 --> 01:09:08,449
... and then the Little Mermaid
said to th<i>e</i> T<i>a</i>xi Driv<i>e</i>r

940
01:09:08,624 --> 01:09:11,376
"l wanna se<i>e</i> New York City.
Please, show me New York. "

941
01:09:11,544 --> 01:09:14,498
'Caus<i>e</i> it's so big. You can't...
you can't just walk around New York.

942
01:09:14,964 --> 01:09:17,716
So the t<i>a</i>xi driver took her
to the Empire State Building,

943
01:09:18,259 --> 01:09:20,631
and you know it's so high
it has two elevators

944
01:09:20,803 --> 01:09:23,259
b<i>e</i>caus<i>e</i> th<i>e</i>y couldn't find
just one cable to build one, you know?

945
01:09:23,431 --> 01:09:26,681
They had to build two.
So he got on the first elevator

946
01:09:26,934 --> 01:09:30,268
and then on the second <i>e</i>levator
that's as fast as a space rocket,

947
01:09:31,105 --> 01:09:33,477
and they got to the top
of th<i>e</i> Empir<i>e</i> State building

948
01:09:33,900 --> 01:09:36,355
and th<i>e</i> Little Merm<i>a</i>id w<i>a</i>s looking down
and she said

949
01:09:36,527 --> 01:09:39,232
"Oh, my God. Peopl<i>e</i> look like ants,
they're so small... "

950
01:09:39,405 --> 01:09:41,481
Hey, guys. Hello, ther<i>e. </i>

951
01:09:41,658 --> 01:09:44,612
We pIayed witches and princesses.

952
01:09:45,203 --> 01:09:47,326
And Ann did our braids.

953
01:09:47,497 --> 01:09:50,284
Oh, they look beautiful. Thank you, Ann.
l'm sorry l took so long.

954
01:09:50,458 --> 01:09:53,210
No, that w<i>a</i>s fine.
We had <i>a</i> great time.

955
01:09:53,378 --> 01:09:55,370
- Wer<i>e</i> you guys good?
- Yeah.

956
01:09:57,548 --> 01:09:59,256
Good. Want your witches hats?

957
01:09:59,842 --> 01:10:02,796
Tomorrow can you finish the story
about the m<i>e</i>rmaid

958
01:10:02,971 --> 01:10:05,426
- and the taxi driver?
- Of cours<i>e. </i> My pl<i>e</i>asure.

959
01:10:05,890 --> 01:10:07,633
Give Ann a kiss goodbye.

960
01:10:09,352 --> 01:10:10,811
W<i>e</i> hav<i>e</i> to go have bath
and supper time now,

961
01:10:10,979 --> 01:10:13,814
but maybe we can come back
and hear th<i>e e</i>nd of that story, okay?

962
01:10:13,982 --> 01:10:16,389
Thank you so much, Ann.
Let's go.

963
01:10:28,079 --> 01:10:29,988
- Hey, Ann?
- Yeah?

964
01:10:30,164 --> 01:10:32,834
l w<i>a</i>s just going to mak<i>e</i> some coffee.
Do you want to come over?

965
01:10:33,001 --> 01:10:33,914
Great.

966
01:10:34,752 --> 01:10:35,867
Just let me finish doing this.

967
01:10:36,129 --> 01:10:37,078
Okay.

968
01:10:42,802 --> 01:10:45,258
- Do you take sugar?
- No, no it's alright.

969
01:10:47,682 --> 01:10:49,306
You'r<i>e</i> not on a diet, ar<i>e</i> you?

970
01:10:49,809 --> 01:10:51,600
No. Why? ShouId I?

971
01:10:51,769 --> 01:10:55,352
No. l just have this friend
who's obsessed with di<i>e</i>ts

972
01:10:55,523 --> 01:10:57,681
and calories and...

973
01:10:57,859 --> 01:10:59,057
Boring.

974
01:10:59,694 --> 01:11:03,145
No, and I've seen too many p<i>e</i>ople
sick with <i>a</i>norexia and bulimi<i>a. </i>

975
01:11:04,073 --> 01:11:05,698
- l'm a nurse. That's why.
- ls th<i>a</i>t so?

976
01:11:06,451 --> 01:11:08,490
So l'm not r<i>e</i>aIIy bothered.

977
01:11:11,164 --> 01:11:12,706
You know, you've got re<i>a</i>lly cute kids.

978
01:11:13,082 --> 01:11:14,909
Yeah, they're great, aren't they?

979
01:11:16,586 --> 01:11:18,625
What <i>a</i>bout you? You want kids?

980
01:11:18,880 --> 01:11:20,457
No, l don't think so.

981
01:11:22,550 --> 01:11:24,543
Why not? l mean,

982
01:11:24,927 --> 01:11:27,597
you think it's stupid
to bring them into the world, or... ?

983
01:11:27,764 --> 01:11:29,922
Just haven't found
the right guy, or... ?

984
01:11:30,975 --> 01:11:32,351
No, l haven't.

985
01:11:33,061 --> 01:11:34,852
No, but it's not that either, no.

986
01:11:35,813 --> 01:11:37,723
Do you think you can't?

987
01:11:38,775 --> 01:11:41,610
No. Well,

988
01:11:42,779 --> 01:11:43,728
l don't know, actu<i>a</i>lly.

989
01:11:51,037 --> 01:11:52,116
But...

990
01:11:55,249 --> 01:11:57,325
l was in my last year
of nursing college.

991
01:11:57,502 --> 01:12:00,419
We were doing some work experience
in a paediatric hospital.

992
01:12:01,631 --> 01:12:04,916
l'd decided to specialize in kids,
because l've alw<i>a</i>ys liked them.

993
01:12:07,428 --> 01:12:09,800
Maybe because l was <i>a</i>n only child.

994
01:12:11,015 --> 01:12:12,130
l don't know. Anyw<i>a</i>y,

995
01:12:13,851 --> 01:12:14,966
one night l was on duty,

996
01:12:15,144 --> 01:12:17,220
<i>a</i>nd they called me in
to heIp with a birth.

997
01:12:17,397 --> 01:12:19,520
This woman was overdue,

998
01:12:19,691 --> 01:12:22,526
sh<i>e</i> was expecting twins,
and the babies were in danger.

999
01:12:24,112 --> 01:12:28,061
So they decided to do
a caesarean

1000
01:12:28,658 --> 01:12:31,612
and the moth<i>e</i>r was put
under a gener<i>a</i>l <i>a</i>naesthetic.

1001
01:12:33,621 --> 01:12:34,736
And...

1002
01:12:37,208 --> 01:12:39,664
it turned out they were Siam<i>e</i>se twins.

1003
01:12:40,670 --> 01:12:43,920
They w<i>e</i>re born without one torso...
on<i>e</i> set of lungs...

1004
01:12:44,090 --> 01:12:45,370
they hardly cried.

1005
01:12:46,968 --> 01:12:48,877
They w<i>e</i>ren't horribl<i>e</i> to look at.

1006
01:12:49,303 --> 01:12:51,676
No, th<i>e</i>y were just Iik<i>e a</i>ny other baby.

1007
01:12:54,600 --> 01:12:55,430
But

1008
01:12:56,352 --> 01:12:58,559
ther<i>e</i> was no way
they were going to survive.

1009
01:12:59,397 --> 01:13:00,476
lt's impossible.

1010
01:13:04,360 --> 01:13:06,567
So we put them in an incubator
while the doctors talked to the f<i>a</i>ther

1011
01:13:06,738 --> 01:13:08,196
about what they shouId do.

1012
01:13:09,741 --> 01:13:11,650
The father didn't even wanna see them.

1013
01:13:14,370 --> 01:13:18,320
So they d<i>e</i>cided to take them out
of the incubator

1014
01:13:21,419 --> 01:13:22,913
and wait for them to di<i>e. </i>

1015
01:13:23,713 --> 01:13:25,207
And l off<i>e</i>red

1016
01:13:25,631 --> 01:13:27,589
to be with them until they...

1017
01:13:27,759 --> 01:13:30,297
l couldn't bear the thought of them
dying alone

1018
01:13:30,470 --> 01:13:32,130
in a cold hospital room.

1019
01:13:36,059 --> 01:13:37,636
They lived thirty hours.

1020
01:13:40,772 --> 01:13:43,179
l held them in my arms thirty hours.

1021
01:13:46,069 --> 01:13:48,524
l sang <i>e</i>very song l knew,

1022
01:13:48,946 --> 01:13:52,362
songs from the world
they could never see, but...

1023
01:13:56,037 --> 01:13:58,610
Anyway, th<i>e</i>y just grew smaller
and smaIIer in my arms.

1024
01:13:59,082 --> 01:14:00,659
First the boy di<i>e</i>d, and...

1025
01:14:04,420 --> 01:14:06,413
six hours later the girl died.

1026
01:14:11,427 --> 01:14:14,677
So... sinc<i>e</i> then l've speci<i>a</i>liz<i>e</i>d
in geri<i>a</i>tric nursing.

1027
01:14:21,771 --> 01:14:23,146
l'm so sorry, Ann.

1028
01:14:25,233 --> 01:14:27,558
l don't know
why l told you this story.

1029
01:14:27,735 --> 01:14:29,443
Th<i>a</i>nks for the coffee.

1030
01:14:29,612 --> 01:14:32,150
You know what? l b<i>e</i>tter be going.
No, l'm sorry.

1031
01:14:32,323 --> 01:14:34,731
Do you want to come over
for dinner next we<i>e</i>k?

1032
01:14:36,661 --> 01:14:39,781
- Are you sure?
- Yeah, no, l would realIy love you to.

1033
01:14:40,790 --> 01:14:42,783
l know th<i>e</i> girls
would r<i>e</i>aIIy lov<i>e</i> it too,

1034
01:14:43,292 --> 01:14:45,166
b<i>e</i>caus<i>e</i> you hav<i>e</i> to tell them
the end of that m<i>e</i>rmaid story,

1035
01:14:45,336 --> 01:14:46,581
they love that story.

1036
01:14:49,757 --> 01:14:51,216
I'd love to, Ann.

1037
01:14:51,801 --> 01:14:53,628
And you know,
that story is happy.

1038
01:14:55,805 --> 01:14:58,474
Thank you so much,
l'd love to.

1039
01:15:03,479 --> 01:15:04,677
Read me something.

1040
01:15:04,897 --> 01:15:07,020
Read m<i>e</i> something
that you're reading right now.

1041
01:15:07,191 --> 01:15:10,109
I'm reading a very sad book
at the moment.

1042
01:15:11,904 --> 01:15:13,363
Beautiful, but sad.

1043
01:15:15,074 --> 01:15:17,482
It can't be as sad
as the story l h<i>e</i>ard today.

1044
01:15:18,119 --> 01:15:19,198
Tell it to me.

1045
01:15:20,038 --> 01:15:21,033
l can't.

1046
01:15:21,414 --> 01:15:22,789
It'll make me too sad.

1047
01:15:22,957 --> 01:15:25,994
You don't wanna teII it to me
because its part of your Iife,

1048
01:15:27,170 --> 01:15:29,743
<i>a</i>nd you don't want me to know
anything about your Iif<i>e. </i>

1049
01:15:29,922 --> 01:15:32,627
I like it that you don't ask me
anything about my life.

1050
01:15:34,052 --> 01:15:36,887
l don't ask you anything
because l've learned not to.

1051
01:15:39,849 --> 01:15:41,474
When you look at som<i>e</i>body,

1052
01:15:43,144 --> 01:15:44,175
you might see

1053
01:15:45,480 --> 01:15:48,053
fifty per cent

1054
01:15:49,734 --> 01:15:50,897
of who they ar<i>e</i>,

1055
01:15:52,654 --> 01:15:56,105
and w<i>a</i>nting to know the rest,
that's what destroys <i>e</i>verything.

1056
01:15:57,200 --> 01:15:58,658
That's what l learnt.

1057
01:15:58,826 --> 01:16:02,076
Whoever took away your furniture
really t<i>a</i>ught you a lesson, eh?

1058
01:16:03,081 --> 01:16:04,954
That's all she left me.

1059
01:16:10,004 --> 01:16:12,839
- You really want me to read you som<i>e</i>thing?
- Please.

1060
01:16:14,092 --> 01:16:15,372
Read me something.

1061
01:16:15,802 --> 01:16:16,797
Okay.

1062
01:16:19,472 --> 01:16:20,635
Pick something.

1063
01:16:22,850 --> 01:16:25,092
"To the Wedding"
by John B<i>e</i>rger.

1064
01:16:42,787 --> 01:16:46,370
"Her capacities go out one by one,

1065
01:16:47,834 --> 01:16:49,542
and there's no night,

1066
01:16:50,169 --> 01:16:51,580
no stars,

1067
01:16:52,964 --> 01:16:55,799
onIy a cell<i>a</i>r from which
she c<i>a</i>n never w<i>a</i>lk

1068
01:16:56,050 --> 01:16:58,541
and which nobody <i>e</i>lse
can stay.

1069
01:17:00,513 --> 01:17:03,431
She's given medicines
which mak<i>e</i> her ill,

1070
01:17:04,267 --> 01:17:06,343
but would stop her dying.

1071
01:17:07,061 --> 01:17:08,259
For a little while.

1072
01:17:08,813 --> 01:17:10,971
They're scared.
l'm scar<i>e</i>d. "

1073
01:17:17,739 --> 01:17:19,612
You know, I don't think it was that bad.

1074
01:17:20,491 --> 01:17:21,950
No, I like it.

1075
01:17:23,328 --> 01:17:25,119
ljust don't want to read right now.

1076
01:17:39,719 --> 01:17:40,999
l lied.

1077
01:17:43,389 --> 01:17:47,007
When l said that when you look at
somebody you know fifty per cent.

1078
01:17:49,520 --> 01:17:51,727
l guess when l look at you l see,

1079
01:17:52,732 --> 01:17:55,353
l don't know, maybe ten per cent...

1080
01:17:58,029 --> 01:18:00,781
and that ten per cent is...

1081
01:18:09,916 --> 01:18:11,196
lt's not so bad. ls it?

1082
01:18:31,104 --> 01:18:33,725
lt's my birthday today.
Wish me a happy birthday.

1083
01:18:34,273 --> 01:18:35,602
Happy birthday, mom.

1084
01:18:41,531 --> 01:18:43,191
Aren't you going to start the c<i>a</i>r?

1085
01:18:44,742 --> 01:18:46,367
l've got something to tell you, Mom.

1086
01:18:47,662 --> 01:18:51,197
lt must be serious, otherwise
you'd tell me while you were driving.

1087
01:18:53,793 --> 01:18:56,035
l n<i>e</i>ed to know
where my Dad is.

1088
01:18:56,921 --> 01:18:58,250
Are you going to go and see him?

1089
01:19:00,675 --> 01:19:01,955
B<i>e</i>caus<i>e</i> that bugs you?

1090
01:19:04,846 --> 01:19:05,711
No,

1091
01:19:07,682 --> 01:19:09,591
not even that c<i>a</i>n m<i>a</i>ke m<i>e</i> mad <i>a</i>nymore.

1092
01:19:15,857 --> 01:19:17,399
This time last year,

1093
01:19:17,984 --> 01:19:19,608
this v<i>e</i>ry sam<i>e</i> day,
my birthday,

1094
01:19:20,278 --> 01:19:23,232
l thought l should do something,
l don't know why.

1095
01:19:24,532 --> 01:19:26,940
So l... l put on some m<i>a</i>keup

1096
01:19:27,327 --> 01:19:29,615
and the least old cIothes
l could find

1097
01:19:29,787 --> 01:19:31,282
and l w<i>e</i>nt to a bar.

1098
01:19:32,373 --> 01:19:34,117
And l ordered a whisky

1099
01:19:35,251 --> 01:19:37,493
and start<i>e</i>d t<i>a</i>lking to
the bartender.

1100
01:19:39,088 --> 01:19:40,832
He was just a kid,

1101
01:19:41,507 --> 01:19:45,208
he'd just started at the hot<i>e</i>l,
it was his first job,

1102
01:19:48,264 --> 01:19:50,423
and we chatt<i>e</i>d about this and th<i>a</i>t,

1103
01:19:50,600 --> 01:19:52,509
and l told him it was my birthday.

1104
01:19:54,979 --> 01:19:56,639
About five minutes later

1105
01:19:58,024 --> 01:20:01,559
he pr<i>e</i>sented me with a bowl of peanuts
with a candle in.

1106
01:20:03,196 --> 01:20:04,275
And l...

1107
01:20:05,114 --> 01:20:06,656
l start<i>e</i>d to cry.

1108
01:20:07,992 --> 01:20:10,234
I cried so hard the kid got scared,

1109
01:20:12,246 --> 01:20:15,497
<i>a</i>nd he blew out the candl<i>e</i>,
and hid th<i>e</i> bowl of pe<i>a</i>nuts,

1110
01:20:16,376 --> 01:20:19,495
and l said
"No, don't blow out the candle.

1111
01:20:19,671 --> 01:20:21,295
Don't hide th<i>e</i> pe<i>a</i>nuts. "

1112
01:20:21,506 --> 01:20:24,175
And all this year,
all l could think about was

1113
01:20:24,425 --> 01:20:27,628
that bowl of peanuts
and how l started to cry.

1114
01:20:28,429 --> 01:20:32,047
So this y<i>e</i>ar,
l baked myself a cake.

1115
01:20:33,685 --> 01:20:37,100
'Cause l knew if l w<i>e</i>nt back to that bar,
l'd give that kid a h<i>e</i>art attack.

1116
01:20:48,616 --> 01:20:49,814
Start the car.

1117
01:21:00,336 --> 01:21:01,250
Five minutes.

1118
01:21:02,964 --> 01:21:04,588
You're almost don<i>e</i>, too.

1119
01:21:05,758 --> 01:21:08,214
- Am l hurting you?
- No, not at all.

1120
01:21:08,386 --> 01:21:09,714
She's gre<i>a</i>t with nails.

1121
01:21:09,887 --> 01:21:12,972
Now, don't you ask h<i>e</i>r to give you
a perm or braids or anything,

1122
01:21:13,141 --> 01:21:15,299
but with naiIs, she's th<i>e</i> best.

1123
01:21:16,394 --> 01:21:18,766
l've got a manicure diplom<i>a</i>

1124
01:21:19,772 --> 01:21:22,442
and ev<i>e</i>rything. l'm not interested
in hair or heads.

1125
01:21:22,859 --> 01:21:24,519
Give me hands every tim<i>e. </i>

1126
01:21:25,111 --> 01:21:27,150
So do you like Milli Vanilli as weII?

1127
01:21:27,697 --> 01:21:31,529
l'm from Segovi<i>a. </i> We don't have
any Mili Vanilli in Segovia.

1128
01:21:32,452 --> 01:21:34,444
Milli Vanilli is univers<i>a</i>l.

1129
01:21:35,496 --> 01:21:37,240
- Thank you very much.
- Thanks.

1130
01:21:38,374 --> 01:21:39,999
So, see you soon.

1131
01:21:41,252 --> 01:21:42,248
No.

1132
01:21:43,004 --> 01:21:43,917
No?

1133
01:21:45,923 --> 01:21:46,837
You know,

1134
01:21:47,383 --> 01:21:50,005
braids realIy suit you.
They look really great on you.

1135
01:21:51,804 --> 01:21:52,967
You think so?

1136
01:21:53,723 --> 01:21:54,636
Yeah.

1137
01:21:56,517 --> 01:21:58,225
Bye.

1138
01:22:47,527 --> 01:22:48,392
Hi...

1139
01:22:51,489 --> 01:22:52,402
Hi.

1140
01:22:53,741 --> 01:22:55,200
How are you, Ann?

1141
01:23:03,459 --> 01:23:05,084
This is Penny and this is Patsy.

1142
01:23:06,004 --> 01:23:07,996
P<i>e</i>nny's six and Patsy's four.

1143
01:23:09,757 --> 01:23:11,417
Th<i>e</i>y're very pr<i>e</i>tty young girls.

1144
01:23:11,926 --> 01:23:13,670
You hav<i>e</i>n't b<i>e</i>en wasting your time.

1145
01:23:14,429 --> 01:23:15,757
You could say that.

1146
01:23:17,348 --> 01:23:18,759
What <i>a</i>bout your husband?

1147
01:23:19,350 --> 01:23:20,346
Don?

1148
01:23:21,686 --> 01:23:23,429
Ah, he builds swimming pools.

1149
01:23:23,604 --> 01:23:25,147
Swimming pools, no less?

1150
01:23:25,481 --> 01:23:26,940
Y<i>e</i>ah, he's doing pretty good.

1151
01:23:28,401 --> 01:23:30,025
l got work here, you know.

1152
01:23:32,238 --> 01:23:34,029
Sewing sports shoes together.

1153
01:23:34,532 --> 01:23:38,482
You know, a sports sho<i>e</i> can take up to
86 diff<i>e</i>rent pieces. Did you know that?

1154
01:23:38,995 --> 01:23:39,694
No.

1155
01:23:40,246 --> 01:23:42,654
We sew the side pieces on here,
and then

1156
01:23:42,874 --> 01:23:44,997
in another jail they finish th<i>e</i>m off.

1157
01:23:47,378 --> 01:23:48,409
lt's good work.

1158
01:23:49,088 --> 01:23:50,084
Sure.

1159
01:23:51,132 --> 01:23:52,875
People are always gonna want to
ne<i>e</i>d shoes, huh?

1160
01:24:00,099 --> 01:24:02,258
Ann, l suppose your mother
still hates me.

1161
01:24:02,935 --> 01:24:04,762
Dad, Mom hates everyone.

1162
01:24:04,937 --> 01:24:07,144
Y<i>e</i>ah, l bet she hat<i>e</i>s me
the most.

1163
01:24:07,523 --> 01:24:08,804
Sometim<i>e</i>s, yeah.

1164
01:24:13,446 --> 01:24:14,691
Some of us...

1165
01:24:16,699 --> 01:24:19,985
just can't live th<i>e</i> kind of life
that other p<i>e</i>opIe want us to live.

1166
01:24:26,000 --> 01:24:27,909
No matter how hard you try,

1167
01:24:29,671 --> 01:24:30,702
you just can't do it.

1168
01:24:31,255 --> 01:24:32,335
l guess.

1169
01:24:33,966 --> 01:24:36,173
- You believe me, don't you?
- Yeah.

1170
01:24:37,428 --> 01:24:38,424
l b<i>e</i>lieve you.

1171
01:24:39,472 --> 01:24:40,551
lt's hard.

1172
01:24:45,436 --> 01:24:46,599
Like you know

1173
01:24:47,313 --> 01:24:49,935
you love som<i>e</i>one
and you can't make them happy.

1174
01:24:53,861 --> 01:24:56,779
lt's kind of lik<i>e</i> you love them, but...

1175
01:25:00,034 --> 01:25:02,608
you can't Iove them
the way they wanna be loved,

1176
01:25:02,787 --> 01:25:03,487
you know wh<i>a</i>t l me<i>a</i>n?

1177
01:25:05,081 --> 01:25:08,616
lf you send me the kids' shoes sizes,
l can make some shoes for them.

1178
01:25:10,003 --> 01:25:11,034
Okay.

1179
01:25:16,592 --> 01:25:18,051
I want to touch your fac<i>e. </i>

1180
01:25:21,973 --> 01:25:24,808
I remember how it us<i>e</i>d to feel.

1181
01:25:26,477 --> 01:25:29,015
l've forgotten a lot of things.
l remember that.

1182
01:25:29,480 --> 01:25:30,761
l remember,

1183
01:25:31,733 --> 01:25:35,647
you used to before you'd leave th<i>e</i> house
you'd put on this record of ringing b<i>e</i>lls

1184
01:25:37,071 --> 01:25:38,898
and then you'd just leave
the hous<i>e</i> like right away.

1185
01:25:41,034 --> 01:25:43,026
l used to like to hear
the music from the house

1186
01:25:43,202 --> 01:25:44,946
as l was walking down th<i>e</i> street.

1187
01:25:46,706 --> 01:25:48,200
lt was re<i>a</i>lly pretty.

1188
01:25:49,167 --> 01:25:50,116
It was?

1189
01:25:50,960 --> 01:25:52,538
lt w<i>a</i>s aIways the same record.

1190
01:25:53,004 --> 01:25:54,795
lt was the Mule Ser<i>e</i>nade.

1191
01:25:57,216 --> 01:25:58,592
lt was re<i>a</i>lly pretty.

1192
01:26:06,517 --> 01:26:08,344
T<i>a</i>ke c<i>a</i>re of yourseIf, Dad, okay?

1193
01:26:10,313 --> 01:26:11,392
Yeah, you too.

1194
01:26:13,316 --> 01:26:16,151
And r<i>e</i>memb<i>e</i>r to send me
the girIs' shoe sizes, okay?

1195
01:26:16,778 --> 01:26:17,892
Yeah, l will.

1196
01:26:46,724 --> 01:26:49,132
Going to hav<i>e</i> a good d<i>a</i>y
at school? Giv<i>e</i> me a kiss.

1197
01:26:50,728 --> 01:26:52,472
Okay, hav<i>e a</i> good day.

1198
01:26:53,606 --> 01:26:57,189
l hope you feel better, Mommy.
l want you to feel better, y<i>e</i>ah.

1199
01:26:58,152 --> 01:27:00,524
- Okay. You have <i>a</i> good day, all right?
- Bye.

1200
01:27:02,532 --> 01:27:03,611
Hey, Patsy.

1201
01:27:05,034 --> 01:27:08,071
- Give me a cuddl<i>e</i>, Mommy.
- I'II giv<i>e</i> you <i>a</i> cuddle.

1202
01:27:08,788 --> 01:27:11,030
- How's that for a cuddle?
- Okay.

1203
01:27:12,000 --> 01:27:14,787
- l need to go now.
- You hav<i>e</i> to go to schooI now?

1204
01:27:14,961 --> 01:27:17,666
Okay. l know,
you're in a bit of a hurry.

1205
01:27:24,220 --> 01:27:26,047
Ar<i>e</i> you sure this is anaemia?

1206
01:27:26,848 --> 01:27:28,639
Maybe w<i>e</i> should go see
another doctor?

1207
01:27:28,808 --> 01:27:31,595
No, l know it's anaemia.
They did Iik<i>e a</i> million tests

1208
01:27:32,228 --> 01:27:35,264
and l've been taking all th<i>e</i> vitamins.
They just told me l need to r<i>e</i>st.

1209
01:27:36,232 --> 01:27:38,355
l took car<i>e</i> of all of you guys
when you were sick,

1210
01:27:38,526 --> 01:27:40,020
it's your turn to t<i>a</i>ke care of me.

1211
01:27:40,361 --> 01:27:41,227
Okay.

1212
01:27:41,529 --> 01:27:43,522
l think l'm going to lik<i>e</i>
taking care of you.

1213
01:27:43,698 --> 01:27:46,023
Y<i>e</i>ah? Let's see
if you're any good at it.

1214
01:27:55,585 --> 01:27:56,616
Okay. By<i>e. </i>

1215
01:28:01,924 --> 01:28:02,956
Don,

1216
01:28:04,302 --> 01:28:07,338
l want you to understand
why l didn't tell you l was goinna die.

1217
01:28:10,099 --> 01:28:11,214
lt was like...

1218
01:28:14,312 --> 01:28:17,728
lt was like the only pr<i>e</i>sent
l could give you and the girls,

1219
01:28:18,566 --> 01:28:21,900
to sav<i>e</i> you all th<i>e</i> trips to the hospital
and all th<i>e</i> stress

1220
01:28:22,278 --> 01:28:24,816
and the waiting around in waiting rooms
and l know if you think about it,

1221
01:28:24,989 --> 01:28:26,068
you'II know th<i>a</i>t l'm right.

1222
01:28:28,284 --> 01:28:29,826
Now you hav<i>e</i> to be h<i>a</i>ppy,

1223
01:28:32,372 --> 01:28:35,408
and you have to look aft<i>e</i>r the girls,
you have to make them happy too.

1224
01:28:39,170 --> 01:28:41,079
Dream up a heaven for me.

1225
01:28:43,424 --> 01:28:45,962
Don't let them be sad
when they remember me.

1226
01:28:46,469 --> 01:28:49,589
You just remind them
of all the gre<i>a</i>t things we did together.

1227
01:28:54,143 --> 01:28:55,388
l Iove you, Don.

1228
01:28:57,146 --> 01:29:01,274
You'll alw<i>a</i>ys b<i>e</i> the guy who took off
his T-shirt to wipe aw<i>a</i>y my tears...

1229
01:29:31,806 --> 01:29:33,384
Sorry it's so out of key.

1230
01:29:33,558 --> 01:29:35,930
It alw<i>a</i>ys kind of was, though.

1231
01:29:43,109 --> 01:29:44,188
Hi, Mom.

1232
01:29:45,445 --> 01:29:47,318
W<i>e</i>ll, l gu<i>e</i>ss you're never
going to forgive me

1233
01:29:47,488 --> 01:29:49,113
for not telling you
l was going to die.

1234
01:29:51,576 --> 01:29:54,612
So, it's just one mor<i>e</i> thing to bl<i>a</i>me
the world for, I guess.

1235
01:29:56,164 --> 01:29:57,409
<i>l love you. </i>

1236
01:29:58,416 --> 01:29:59,827
<i>l know you love me. </i>

1237
01:30:01,044 --> 01:30:02,870
l know you adore the girls,

1238
01:30:05,214 --> 01:30:06,459
so please

1239
01:30:07,633 --> 01:30:08,796
tell them that.

1240
01:30:10,762 --> 01:30:14,261
Try and show like you love them
just a little bit every day.

1241
01:30:14,932 --> 01:30:17,969
And try to enjoy lif<i>e</i>,

1242
01:30:18,144 --> 01:30:19,519
you know, a littIe, just a littIe bit.

1243
01:30:19,687 --> 01:30:23,187
l me<i>a</i>n, maybe at some point
you could go on a d<i>a</i>te.

1244
01:30:23,358 --> 01:30:24,472
That wouId be fun,

1245
01:30:24,650 --> 01:30:27,272
or you could put an ad
in th<i>e</i> paper or anything.

1246
01:30:27,445 --> 01:30:29,568
l just think
you couId hav<i>e a</i> little fun.

1247
01:30:29,739 --> 01:30:32,360
You're really beautiful
and you've got a great heart

1248
01:30:33,576 --> 01:30:35,035
and just try

1249
01:30:35,828 --> 01:30:37,620
<i>a</i>nd enjoy stuff more.

1250
01:30:39,165 --> 01:30:40,624
<i>Please help Don. </i>

1251
01:30:43,961 --> 01:30:46,535
You can tell the girls
any stories you like,

1252
01:30:46,714 --> 01:30:48,623
even Joan Cr<i>a</i>wford movies.

1253
01:31:12,824 --> 01:31:15,231
Your sister really knows
how to pick a song, hey.

1254
01:31:16,536 --> 01:31:18,824
- You like it?
- Yeah, it's great.

1255
01:31:19,163 --> 01:31:21,203
lt's Blossom Dearie.
You ever heard of her?

1256
01:31:21,374 --> 01:31:22,405
No. Wh<i>a</i>t's that?

1257
01:31:23,167 --> 01:31:25,872
Blossom Dearie?
Oh, she's amazing.

1258
01:31:26,504 --> 01:31:28,627
Sh<i>e</i>'s still singing
and she's 83 years oId.

1259
01:31:29,090 --> 01:31:30,253
83?

1260
01:31:30,425 --> 01:31:32,750
And she plays in this little club

1261
01:31:33,344 --> 01:31:36,014
behind a Chinese lounge

1262
01:31:36,472 --> 01:31:37,753
and

1263
01:31:38,099 --> 01:31:40,257
she has this tiny little voice,

1264
01:31:40,810 --> 01:31:43,562
this tiny little body
and such personality and...

1265
01:31:43,730 --> 01:31:46,517
- 83.
- Ye<i>a</i>h, she's 83.

1266
01:31:47,859 --> 01:31:49,567
l'd lov<i>e</i> to take you there.

1267
01:31:59,620 --> 01:32:01,993
Ann, there's so many places
l'd Iike to take you.

1268
01:32:02,331 --> 01:32:04,573
TeII me about all the plac<i>e</i>s
you'd like to take me.

1269
01:32:06,294 --> 01:32:07,207
Okay.

1270
01:32:08,004 --> 01:32:10,210
ln the south of Chile,
there's a desert,

1271
01:32:11,924 --> 01:32:13,419
it's stunning,

1272
01:32:13,760 --> 01:32:17,294
pur<i>e</i> white and flat
as far as the eye can see

1273
01:32:17,555 --> 01:32:20,591
and the only thing that br<i>e</i>aks
the lin<i>e</i> of the horizon

1274
01:32:20,975 --> 01:32:24,309
ar<i>e</i> these robin-egg
blue little houses

1275
01:32:24,729 --> 01:32:27,054
and in the morning,
the sky goes

1276
01:32:27,231 --> 01:32:28,774
completely gre<i>e</i>n.

1277
01:32:29,567 --> 01:32:30,978
lt's unworldly.

1278
01:32:31,944 --> 01:32:34,649
And in Argentina,

1279
01:32:36,366 --> 01:32:37,564
<i>a</i> glacier lake,

1280
01:32:37,992 --> 01:32:41,029
and in the spring
when the thaw com<i>e</i>s on,

1281
01:32:42,872 --> 01:32:46,241
these huge blocks of ice,
l mean huge,

1282
01:32:46,417 --> 01:32:47,876
the size of apartment buiIdings,

1283
01:32:48,044 --> 01:32:50,036
com<i>e</i> sliding off the glacier
into the lake

1284
01:32:51,339 --> 01:32:54,874
and then your he<i>a</i>rt is pounding out
of your chest, it's terrifying.

1285
01:32:56,427 --> 01:32:58,965
And Mexico and Al<i>a</i>sk<i>a... </i>

1286
01:32:59,639 --> 01:33:00,635
Are you OK?

1287
01:33:02,392 --> 01:33:03,637
What's the matt<i>e</i>r?

1288
01:33:05,311 --> 01:33:07,019
I'm not going to see thes<i>e</i> pIaces.

1289
01:33:09,273 --> 01:33:10,269
What is it?

1290
01:33:10,441 --> 01:33:11,686
What's the matt<i>e</i>r?

1291
01:33:14,112 --> 01:33:15,357
You don't wanna tell me?

1292
01:33:15,905 --> 01:33:17,696
l'm so sorry, Lee.

1293
01:33:20,410 --> 01:33:22,367
- l really need to get out of here.
- Okay.

1294
01:33:25,873 --> 01:33:28,162
Waiter!
Can l get the check?

1295
01:33:29,085 --> 01:33:30,081
Thank you.

1296
01:33:31,379 --> 01:33:33,253
l always wanted to come her<i>e. </i>

1297
01:33:35,967 --> 01:33:38,588
Could you get th<i>e</i>m to put this
in a doggy bag for me?

1298
01:33:39,387 --> 01:33:40,418
Sure.

1299
01:33:40,805 --> 01:33:41,920
Thanks.

1300
01:33:44,017 --> 01:33:45,760
Okay, l'll meet you outsid<i>e</i>, okay?

1301
01:34:18,343 --> 01:34:19,885
You have to go.

1302
01:34:21,888 --> 01:34:24,972
He's gonna be here any minut<i>e. </i>
He works nearby.

1303
01:34:26,476 --> 01:34:30,058
lt's b<i>e</i>tter if he comes and picks me up.
This happens occasionally, so...

1304
01:34:35,068 --> 01:34:37,985
Ann, there's something that l have
to tell you, and l have to tell you now.

1305
01:34:38,863 --> 01:34:39,812
l love you.

1306
01:34:42,408 --> 01:34:44,152
l'm in love with you...

1307
01:34:45,953 --> 01:34:49,120
<i>a</i>nd the world seems less terrible
because you exist.

1308
01:34:51,292 --> 01:34:54,743
l feel like l w<i>a</i>nna be with you
for the rest of my lif<i>e</i>,

1309
01:34:54,921 --> 01:34:57,494
and all that, the p<i>a</i>lpitations,
and the nerves,

1310
01:34:57,674 --> 01:35:01,125
and the pain, and the happiness,
and the fe<i>a</i>r...

1311
01:35:04,430 --> 01:35:05,509
l wanna...

1312
01:35:05,932 --> 01:35:08,138
l wanna touch you all the time.

1313
01:35:08,768 --> 01:35:11,093
l wann<i>a</i> tak<i>e</i> care of you,
and your girls and...

1314
01:35:11,270 --> 01:35:15,138
and even find your husband
a decent job and get you a house

1315
01:35:15,316 --> 01:35:18,400
- th<i>a</i>t doesn't have wheels <i>a</i>nd...
- Careful.

1316
01:35:19,570 --> 01:35:21,978
That sounds like a classic case
of falling in lov<i>e. </i>

1317
01:35:22,740 --> 01:35:23,855
l am in lov<i>e. </i>

1318
01:35:25,493 --> 01:35:27,450
l'm classically in love.

1319
01:35:28,996 --> 01:35:32,081
The cl<i>a</i>ssic husband
who's gonna be her<i>e a</i>ny minute,

1320
01:35:32,583 --> 01:35:36,035
and th<i>e</i> classic d<i>e</i>pression that sets
in every time you go off with him,

1321
01:35:36,921 --> 01:35:38,332
and the crying

1322
01:35:38,548 --> 01:35:40,706
and the te<i>a</i>rs and everything.

1323
01:36:04,073 --> 01:36:05,188
l'll go.

1324
01:36:08,036 --> 01:36:11,202
Though I don't want to see you
driving off with som<i>e</i> guy, you know?

1325
01:36:11,372 --> 01:36:12,950
Someon<i>e</i> you don't know.

1326
01:36:14,500 --> 01:36:15,829
So, l'll be watching.

1327
01:36:18,463 --> 01:36:20,455
Unl<i>e</i>ss of course it's your husband.

1328
01:38:13,745 --> 01:38:15,239
Ann, l fe<i>e</i>l terrible.

1329
01:38:15,621 --> 01:38:18,112
l invited you over to dinner
and now you have to do all the work.

1330
01:38:18,374 --> 01:38:20,616
That's okay,
ljust have to h<i>e</i>at up this.

1331
01:38:22,086 --> 01:38:22,833
So l still don't understand

1332
01:38:23,004 --> 01:38:24,664
why you had to go to th<i>e</i> restaurant
in your condition...

1333
01:38:24,881 --> 01:38:27,087
l told you l thought
l w<i>a</i>s fe<i>e</i>ling better.

1334
01:38:27,467 --> 01:38:30,800
A bad cas<i>e</i> of anaemia isn't something
you should take lightly. You should rest.

1335
01:38:30,970 --> 01:38:32,251
Yes, listen to Nurse Ann, Ann.

1336
01:38:37,268 --> 01:38:38,597
And you know what?

1337
01:38:40,104 --> 01:38:42,678
l think you couId go wash your hands,
'cause this is ready.

1338
01:38:42,940 --> 01:38:44,435
Go wash up, girls.

1339
01:38:48,404 --> 01:38:49,483
- Don...
- Yeah?

1340
01:38:49,655 --> 01:38:52,906
- You too.
- All right, yes ma'am.

1341
01:38:54,744 --> 01:38:57,496
<i>You pray that this will be</i>
<i>your life without you... </i>

1342
01:38:57,663 --> 01:38:59,822
<i>you pray that the girls</i>
<i>will love this woman</i>

1343
01:38:59,999 --> 01:39:01,162
<i>who has the same name as you, </i>

1344
01:39:02,377 --> 01:39:04,832
<i>and that your husband</i>
<i>will end up loving her too, </i>

1345
01:39:05,171 --> 01:39:08,006
<i>and that they can live in the house</i>
<i>next door, and the girls can play</i>

1346
01:39:08,174 --> 01:39:10,879
<i>doll houses in the trailer, </i>
<i>and barely remember their mother</i>

1347
01:39:11,052 --> 01:39:14,503
<i>who used to sleep during the day, </i>
<i>and take them on raft rides in bed. </i>

1348
01:39:15,390 --> 01:39:18,509
<i>You pray that they will have moments</i>
<i>of happiness so intense</i>

1349
01:39:18,726 --> 01:39:22,012
<i>that all of their problems</i>
<i>will seem insignificant in comparison. </i>

1350
01:39:22,855 --> 01:39:26,022
<i>You don't know who or what</i>
<i>you're praying to, but you pray. </i>

1351
01:39:28,069 --> 01:39:31,070
<i>You don't even regret the life</i>
<i>that you're not gonna have, </i>

1352
01:39:31,948 --> 01:39:33,572
<i>because by then</i>
<i>you'll be dead, </i>

1353
01:39:34,325 --> 01:39:36,152
<i>and the dead don't feel anything, </i>

1354
01:39:36,411 --> 01:39:37,905
<i>not even regret. </i>

1355
01:39:47,964 --> 01:39:49,375
<i>My darling Lee, </i>

1356
01:39:51,008 --> 01:39:53,760
<i>l guess by the time you get this tape</i>
<i>you'll know that l'm dead</i>

1357
01:39:56,514 --> 01:39:58,056
<i>and, well, all that... </i>

1358
01:40:00,059 --> 01:40:03,974
<i>Maybe you're angry with me, </i>
<i>or hurt or sad or upset</i>

1359
01:40:04,188 --> 01:40:05,564
<i>or maybe you're all of it together. </i>

1360
01:40:07,942 --> 01:40:09,851
<i>l just want you to know</i>
<i>that l fell in love with you. </i>

1361
01:40:12,196 --> 01:40:14,154
<i>l didn't dare tell you 'cause</i>

1362
01:40:15,700 --> 01:40:18,025
<i>l thought you kind of knew, </i>

1363
01:40:18,411 --> 01:40:21,198
<i>and l didn't realize</i>
<i>l had so little time. </i>

1364
01:40:22,248 --> 01:40:25,866
<i>Actually, time is the one thing</i>
<i>l haven't had enough of recently. </i>

1365
01:40:27,795 --> 01:40:29,835
<i>Life is so much better</i>
<i>than you think, my love. </i>

1366
01:40:32,008 --> 01:40:33,336
<i>l know, because</i>

1367
01:40:34,093 --> 01:40:36,667
<i>you managed to fall in love with me</i>
<i>even though you saw, </i>

1368
01:40:36,846 --> 01:40:39,467
<i>what was it, </i>
<i>you said ten per cent?. </i>

1369
01:40:40,850 --> 01:40:42,095
<i>Five maybe?</i>

1370
01:40:44,771 --> 01:40:47,392
<i>Maybe if you'd seen it all, </i>
<i>you wouldn't have liked me. </i>

1371
01:40:49,192 --> 01:40:51,813
<i>Or you would have liked me</i>
<i>in spite of everything. </i>

1372
01:40:53,529 --> 01:40:55,072
<i>l guess we'll never know. </i>

1373
01:40:56,657 --> 01:40:59,113
<i>Oh, and one last thing... Lee, </i>
<i>for God's sake</i>

1374
01:40:59,702 --> 01:41:03,036
<i>just paint your walls</i>
<i>and buy some furniture. </i>

1375
01:41:03,664 --> 01:41:06,286
<i>Alright? l don't want</i>
<i>the next woman you take home</i>

1376
01:41:06,459 --> 01:41:07,574
<i>to get the wrong idea about you</i>

1377
01:41:07,752 --> 01:41:10,124
<i>and run off before she gets</i>
<i>a chance to know you. </i>

1378
01:41:12,048 --> 01:41:14,669
<i>Not everyone's as crazy</i>
<i>as l am. </i>

1379
01:41:15,176 --> 01:41:16,836
<i>l loved dancing with you. </i>
