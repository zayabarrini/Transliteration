1
00:00:49,400 --> 00:00:55,322
GERMANY YEAR ZERO

2
00:01:37,865 --> 00:01:45,288
DEDICATED TO THE MEMORY
OF MY SON ROMANO

3
00:02:16,070 --> 00:02:20,282
The Russian sector had jam yesterday,
and the Yanks had margarine.

4
00:02:20,408 --> 00:02:23,994
So they'll slap honey
on bread for us. As always.

5
00:02:24,203 --> 00:02:26,747
I'm sick and tired of it all.

6
00:02:26,873 --> 00:02:28,999
In that case,
jump in that grave.

7
00:02:30,293 --> 00:02:32,586
Enough talk about being tired.

8
00:02:32,754 --> 00:02:37,466
Didn't I say 6. 5 x 5 x 2 feet?

9
00:02:37,759 --> 00:02:39,676
We're not digging for potatoes here.

10
00:02:39,802 --> 00:02:42,137
That kid isn't pulling his weight!

11
00:02:42,263 --> 00:02:44,431
- What's he doing here anyway?
- How old are you?

12
00:02:44,974 --> 00:02:46,600
- Fifteen.
- He's lying!

13
00:02:46,768 --> 00:02:48,727
If he's 13, I'll eat my hat.

14
00:02:48,853 --> 00:02:52,105
He's only 12.
He goes to school with my boy.

15
00:02:52,231 --> 00:02:53,899
- Is that true?
- Leave me alone!

16
00:02:54,025 --> 00:02:55,609
Where's your work permit?

17
00:02:55,735 --> 00:02:56,985
In my bag.

18
00:02:57,111 --> 00:03:00,322
I'm sure it's forged.
These scamps will try anything.

19
00:03:00,448 --> 00:03:03,617
You need a work permit
to work here, kid.

20
00:03:35,024 --> 00:03:36,483
I want a piece too.

21
00:03:36,651 --> 00:03:38,026
Get lost.

22
00:03:38,152 --> 00:03:40,111
Go on, scram.

23
00:03:58,214 --> 00:04:00,799
Leave that coal alone,
you rascal.

24
00:04:00,967 --> 00:04:03,343
Just wait till I get
my hands on you.

25
00:05:15,458 --> 00:05:16,833
What's going on?

26
00:05:16,959 --> 00:05:19,169
It’s the man
from the power company.

27
00:05:21,756 --> 00:05:24,424
You went over by 62 kilowatts.

28
00:05:24,592 --> 00:05:27,761
- I knew it.
- There are 10 of us living here.

29
00:05:27,887 --> 00:05:29,554
Five separate household’s.

30
00:05:29,680 --> 00:05:32,641
That’s no excuse.
You can expect a steep fine.

31
00:05:32,767 --> 00:05:34,935
- Got any cigarettes?
- I gave them all away.

32
00:05:35,061 --> 00:05:36,311
These are my last.

33
00:05:36,437 --> 00:05:38,146
- What about you?
- No.

34
00:05:38,272 --> 00:05:40,774
- Did you bring back anything?
- Just some coal.

35
00:05:44,111 --> 00:05:47,155
all right. I'll carry the excess
over to next month.

36
00:05:49,784 --> 00:05:51,910
This is not to happen again.

37
00:05:52,036 --> 00:05:54,579
Last week it was the gas,
now the electricity.

38
00:05:54,705 --> 00:05:56,790
Next you'll all be
stumbling in the dark.

39
00:05:56,916 --> 00:06:00,627
We need stricter rules.
From now on, no hot water.

40
00:06:00,795 --> 00:06:02,796
We can't run around like pigs.

41
00:06:02,922 --> 00:06:06,549
I always use cold water.
Nobody can say I'm dirty.

42
00:06:06,676 --> 00:06:08,843
Can I still use
my hairdryer, Papa?

43
00:06:08,970 --> 00:06:10,971
Keep quiet.

44
00:06:11,097 --> 00:06:13,306
I'll sort it out with the Kohlers.

45
00:06:13,432 --> 00:06:16,643
Let him talk.
Don't do anything stupid.

46
00:06:16,769 --> 00:06:18,603
- Everything okay?
- Yes.

47
00:06:18,729 --> 00:06:20,689
all that fuss with their father -

48
00:06:20,815 --> 00:06:24,651
tea, hot-water bottles,
hot compresses.

49
00:06:24,860 --> 00:06:26,361
This can't go on.

50
00:06:26,487 --> 00:06:28,822
Don't forget he's a sick man.

51
00:06:28,990 --> 00:06:32,450
Sick! We're all sick.
No one has it any better.

52
00:06:32,576 --> 00:06:33,827
I know, but -

53
00:06:33,953 --> 00:06:36,830
Easy for you to say. You have
no idea what we went through.

54
00:06:39,250 --> 00:06:42,335
- Everything okay?
- Yes, don't worry.

55
00:06:42,461 --> 00:06:43,920
What was all that about?

56
00:06:44,046 --> 00:06:46,506
They read the meter.
Too much power.

57
00:06:47,008 --> 00:06:50,802
- So they're cutting off the power?
- We talked him out of it.

58
00:06:51,095 --> 00:06:53,346
You got all dirty again.

59
00:06:53,472 --> 00:06:55,724
Did you get the level 2 card?

60
00:06:55,850 --> 00:06:58,351
No, they found out I wasn't 15.

61
00:06:58,519 --> 00:07:02,188
That’s easy to see.
I knew that would happen.

62
00:07:02,356 --> 00:07:04,733
Actually, I'm glad it did.

63
00:07:04,984 --> 00:07:07,360
That's no work
for a 13-year-oId boy.

64
00:07:07,528 --> 00:07:10,572
It would have meant more to eat.
For Karl-Heinz too.

65
00:07:10,698 --> 00:07:12,574
You hear that...

66
00:07:12,700 --> 00:07:14,451
Karl-Heinz?

67
00:07:14,618 --> 00:07:19,372
You understand that
your brother is shouldering

68
00:07:19,582 --> 00:07:22,459
the entire burden
of our existence by himself?

69
00:07:22,585 --> 00:07:24,252
And you?

70
00:07:24,545 --> 00:07:26,254
What do you do?

71
00:07:26,380 --> 00:07:28,214
You go on hiding.

72
00:07:28,340 --> 00:07:33,053
You didn't even register
and get a ration card.

73
00:07:33,596 --> 00:07:37,640
How can four people get by
on only three food cards?

74
00:07:37,767 --> 00:07:41,728
We can't afford
the black market.

75
00:07:42,605 --> 00:07:44,689
We've sold everything.

76
00:07:45,024 --> 00:07:48,568
I'd do anything for you,

77
00:07:48,694 --> 00:07:51,321
anything within
my feeble power...

78
00:07:52,323 --> 00:07:54,449
but in my condition -

79
00:07:54,617 --> 00:07:59,079
Just think what madness it is,
what you're doing.

80
00:07:59,705 --> 00:08:01,456
What could
possibly happen to you?

81
00:08:01,582 --> 00:08:04,084
I won't kick the bucket
in a POW camp.

82
00:08:04,210 --> 00:08:06,127
I've had enough.
I can't go on.

83
00:08:06,253 --> 00:08:10,131
But I showed you the newspaper,
and you heard it on the radio.

84
00:08:10,257 --> 00:08:13,426
Ex-military don't have
to turn themselves in now.

85
00:08:13,594 --> 00:08:16,596
You just have to register
with the police, like everyone else.

86
00:08:16,722 --> 00:08:19,933
And when they find out
I fought to the very end

87
00:08:20,059 --> 00:08:21,518
and what regiment I was in,

88
00:08:21,644 --> 00:08:23,728
you think they'll let me go?

89
00:08:23,854 --> 00:08:27,398
That was war. You were doing
your duty as a soldier.

90
00:08:27,525 --> 00:08:29,317
They can't hold that against you.

91
00:08:29,443 --> 00:08:32,278
Easy for you to say.
It's not your life on the line.

92
00:08:33,614 --> 00:08:36,616
Papa, you have no idea.
You haven't been out there.

93
00:08:36,784 --> 00:08:38,368
It's just logic.

94
00:08:38,494 --> 00:08:40,203
Has anyone caused us
any trouble up to now?

95
00:08:40,329 --> 00:08:43,623
Fine! If you'll take
the responsibility,

96
00:08:43,749 --> 00:08:45,917
I'll turn myself in right now.

97
00:08:46,043 --> 00:08:48,211
No, Karl-Heinz!

98
00:08:48,671 --> 00:08:49,921
Stay here.

99
00:08:50,047 --> 00:08:52,799
I'll find something,
and so will Eva.

100
00:08:53,008 --> 00:08:54,843
Just give us a little time.

101
00:08:54,969 --> 00:08:57,971
Of course, Edmund.
We'll manage somehow.

102
00:08:58,097 --> 00:09:00,014
I have to go see
Mr. Rademacher.

103
00:09:00,141 --> 00:09:02,433
He has something for me.
I'll be right back.

104
00:09:02,560 --> 00:09:04,811
It's always worked out so far.

105
00:09:04,937 --> 00:09:07,772
Father, you'll be
more comfy like this.

106
00:09:09,984 --> 00:09:11,901
You and I have to talk.
- Fine.

107
00:09:12,027 --> 00:09:13,570
But not here.
Come to my room.

108
00:09:13,696 --> 00:09:15,488
So that person sees me, right?

109
00:09:15,656 --> 00:09:17,824
- She's harmless.
- Harmless!

110
00:09:17,992 --> 00:09:20,285
Sure, the so-called
"victims of Fascism. "

111
00:09:20,411 --> 00:09:23,163
Then come to the bathroom.
No one will see us there.

112
00:09:25,791 --> 00:09:27,500
See if anyone's out there.

113
00:09:27,668 --> 00:09:30,253
No, there's no one there.

114
00:09:30,462 --> 00:09:32,005
Come on.

115
00:09:38,012 --> 00:09:40,013
I've kept my mouth shut

116
00:09:40,181 --> 00:09:43,099
because I didn't want to quarrel
in Father's presence.

117
00:09:43,225 --> 00:09:46,102
You know his condition.
We mustn't get him agitated.

118
00:09:46,228 --> 00:09:49,355
I didn't start anything.
I'm happy to be left alone.

119
00:09:49,523 --> 00:09:51,232
- Because you're a coward.
- Maybe.

120
00:09:51,358 --> 00:09:53,193
And horribly selfish.

121
00:09:53,694 --> 00:09:56,279
You don't care where the food
comes from, as long as it's there.

122
00:09:56,405 --> 00:09:58,364
I didn't make Edmund go to work.

123
00:09:58,532 --> 00:10:00,491
No, you don't make
anyone do anything,

124
00:10:00,618 --> 00:10:02,994
and yet here you are,
hungry and thirsty.

125
00:10:03,120 --> 00:10:06,456
You don't care where I go at night
as long as I bring home cigarettes.

126
00:10:06,582 --> 00:10:08,166
Do I smoke them?

127
00:10:08,292 --> 00:10:11,836
No, but you know they provide
the bare necessities.

128
00:10:11,962 --> 00:10:15,048
Should I admire you for that?
all the girls do that these days.

129
00:10:15,174 --> 00:10:17,050
- And more.
- You see?

130
00:10:17,218 --> 00:10:19,761
You want me to become
a whore for you?

131
00:10:20,012 --> 00:10:22,597
Sorry, I didn't mean it.

132
00:10:22,806 --> 00:10:24,682
We're both on edge.

133
00:10:24,808 --> 00:10:27,310
But just look at our situation.

134
00:10:27,436 --> 00:10:30,688
We get more desperate every day.
- You needn't tell me.

135
00:10:30,814 --> 00:10:32,774
We just can't let Edmund -

136
00:10:32,900 --> 00:10:36,069
I know that.
Don't you think I worry about it?

137
00:10:36,195 --> 00:10:38,529
But you all think
only of yourselves.

138
00:10:38,656 --> 00:10:41,824
You've forgotten
what I went through all those years.

139
00:10:41,951 --> 00:10:43,284
You're wrong.

140
00:10:43,410 --> 00:10:45,912
We know that you almost
died of thirst near Tobruk

141
00:10:46,038 --> 00:10:47,830
and nearly
froze to death in Russia.

142
00:10:47,957 --> 00:10:50,708
I don't want to suffer anymore.
I'd rather end it all.

143
00:10:50,834 --> 00:10:52,418
No, Karl-Heinz.

144
00:10:52,544 --> 00:10:55,838
You survived it all,
and you'll go on living.

145
00:10:58,175 --> 00:11:00,009
Ah, here you are, Gina.
Come along.

146
00:11:00,135 --> 00:11:01,761
Mommy, I want to stay here.

147
00:11:01,887 --> 00:11:03,638
Your girl’s no bother.

148
00:11:03,764 --> 00:11:07,100
- You're working in this light?
- We must save electricity.

149
00:11:07,226 --> 00:11:09,602
Not when you really need it.

150
00:11:11,105 --> 00:11:12,313
Can I give you a hand?

151
00:11:12,439 --> 00:11:13,815
Thanks, I'm fine.

152
00:11:13,941 --> 00:11:16,109
- You're suspicious of me too.
- No.

153
00:11:16,277 --> 00:11:18,736
- But the others are, aren't they?
- I think so.

154
00:11:18,862 --> 00:11:20,363
Why?

155
00:11:20,489 --> 00:11:23,283
Because I was abroad
for so long?

156
00:11:23,409 --> 00:11:26,536
- No, it's your political views.
- That's ridiculous.

157
00:11:26,662 --> 00:11:30,456
The Rademachers hate me
because I'm taking up a room.

158
00:11:30,582 --> 00:11:34,377
- Are we moving again?
- No. Now hush.

159
00:11:34,628 --> 00:11:38,965
You room with Miss KohIer.
They're nice, simple people.

160
00:11:39,258 --> 00:11:41,592
What have they got against me?

161
00:11:41,719 --> 00:11:44,262
I'm sure it's because their son -

162
00:11:45,431 --> 00:11:46,681
Come on, Gina.

163
00:11:46,807 --> 00:11:48,850
I'll pick out some linens for you.

164
00:11:48,976 --> 00:11:51,602
You can make diapers
out of them.

165
00:11:53,480 --> 00:11:55,606
She's always very helpful.

166
00:11:55,733 --> 00:11:57,692
I don't believe
in help from strangers.

167
00:11:57,818 --> 00:12:00,611
Everyone has to help
themselves these days.

168
00:12:00,738 --> 00:12:03,323
I'm very understanding, my boy.
I'm no monster.

169
00:12:03,449 --> 00:12:05,825
But there's a limit.
I've told you that before.

170
00:12:05,993 --> 00:12:09,620
I didn't know what kind
of help you were offering.

171
00:12:09,830 --> 00:12:11,831
Can't I get something for you?

172
00:12:11,999 --> 00:12:14,542
You know
I hate the black market.

173
00:12:14,668 --> 00:12:16,002
Or swap something?

174
00:12:16,128 --> 00:12:18,463
That's what the official
Exchange Office is for.

175
00:12:18,589 --> 00:12:21,758
They swindle us every time.
Give him the scale.

176
00:12:21,884 --> 00:12:24,761
My scale?
How will I check my weight?

177
00:12:24,887 --> 00:12:28,389
It's not the first thing
we've had to sacrifice, my dear.

178
00:12:28,515 --> 00:12:31,309
Go get the scale.
- all right.

179
00:12:31,685 --> 00:12:33,728
How much should I ask for it?

180
00:12:33,854 --> 00:12:37,023
- What can we get for it, Mother?
- I'd think 200 marks.

181
00:12:37,191 --> 00:12:39,484
Far too little. At least 300.

182
00:12:39,610 --> 00:12:41,486
Exactly the price
of a pound of butter.

183
00:12:41,612 --> 00:12:43,321
Edmund - Oh, pardon me.

184
00:12:43,447 --> 00:12:46,366
Your food's getting cold.
Hurry. I still want to go out.

185
00:12:46,492 --> 00:12:48,659
- I'll be right there.
- Excuse me.

186
00:12:48,786 --> 00:12:50,787
Miss Rademacher...

187
00:12:51,622 --> 00:12:54,040
may I please see the scale?

188
00:12:54,166 --> 00:12:58,044
It's an outrage!
That woman has no shame!

189
00:12:58,379 --> 00:13:00,546
Just like that hussy Blanke.

190
00:13:00,714 --> 00:13:04,175
To think our daughter
has to mix with such people.

191
00:13:04,301 --> 00:13:06,511
A typical sign of the times.

192
00:13:06,637 --> 00:13:09,931
What have you got against my sister?
Why are you always groaning about us?

193
00:13:10,057 --> 00:13:11,474
Be quiet.

194
00:13:11,600 --> 00:13:15,478
Take the scale, and don't come back
with less than 300 marks.

195
00:13:15,604 --> 00:13:17,230
Got that?

196
00:13:17,523 --> 00:13:20,650
Yes, Mr. Rademacher.
I'll come for it tomorrow.

197
00:13:38,085 --> 00:13:40,378
- Eva?
- What is it?

198
00:13:40,504 --> 00:13:42,171
Where are you going?

199
00:13:42,923 --> 00:13:45,133
- Out.
- Why are you going out?

200
00:13:45,759 --> 00:13:48,719
- I go out every night.
- Why?

201
00:13:48,929 --> 00:13:50,763
To take my mind off things.

202
00:13:50,889 --> 00:13:53,516
- Ready to go?
- I'm coming.

203
00:13:53,934 --> 00:13:56,144
They won't wait for us, you know.

204
00:13:56,562 --> 00:13:57,812
Yes, I know.

205
00:13:58,814 --> 00:14:01,441
I don't want you
to go out every night.

206
00:14:01,817 --> 00:14:05,111
What's gotten into you
all of a sudden?

207
00:14:05,779 --> 00:14:07,613
What are you thinking?

208
00:14:08,782 --> 00:14:10,533
Come, my child.

209
00:14:11,034 --> 00:14:12,827
Look me in the eye.

210
00:14:15,372 --> 00:14:18,166
Now go to bed...

211
00:14:18,667 --> 00:14:20,668
and don't worry about a thing.

212
00:15:17,184 --> 00:15:19,685
- Cigarette, mademoiselle?
- Thank you.

213
00:15:19,811 --> 00:15:21,479
Garcon, two cognacs.

214
00:15:22,356 --> 00:15:24,690
- Merci. Not right now. Later.
- all right.

215
00:15:27,653 --> 00:15:29,237
Jean, still in Berlin?

216
00:15:29,363 --> 00:15:31,697
That's right, my friend.
Excuse me a moment?

217
00:15:32,616 --> 00:15:34,617
He's nice, your Frenchman.

218
00:15:34,743 --> 00:15:36,202
Yes, very nice.

219
00:15:36,328 --> 00:15:39,914
You'd better hurry
and seize this opportunity.

220
00:15:40,040 --> 00:15:42,583
I'm fine just enjoying
myself a bit.

221
00:15:42,709 --> 00:15:46,170
I don't think you understand
how to really handle men.

222
00:15:46,421 --> 00:15:49,549
- I can't do it.
- Don't be so stupid, child.

223
00:15:49,716 --> 00:15:52,426
You might catch one for keeps.

224
00:15:52,553 --> 00:15:55,596
I told you, I can't do it.
I'm just too stupid.

225
00:15:55,722 --> 00:15:57,640
Having a good time?

226
00:15:57,975 --> 00:15:59,684
Come to the Bavarina with us?

227
00:15:59,810 --> 00:16:01,394
I'll walk with you a ways,

228
00:16:01,562 --> 00:16:03,187
but then I'm going home.

229
00:16:14,074 --> 00:16:16,158
Young people
just don't feel like working.

230
00:16:16,285 --> 00:16:18,661
All they think about
is the black market.

231
00:16:18,787 --> 00:16:20,955
- You know the Lehmann boy?
- Working in construction?

232
00:16:21,081 --> 00:16:23,249
"Working"?
If you ask what he's doing,

233
00:16:23,375 --> 00:16:25,751
he says, "I don't know.
I start tomorrow. "

234
00:16:26,044 --> 00:16:28,254
Hurry, Hilde.
There'll be nothing left.

235
00:16:28,380 --> 00:16:29,755
A few grams won't matter.

236
00:16:29,923 --> 00:16:31,966
But if there's nothing at home -

237
00:16:32,092 --> 00:16:34,218
Hey, get in line!

238
00:16:37,347 --> 00:16:40,349
It's getting harder and harder
with three hungry men in the house.

239
00:16:40,475 --> 00:16:42,018
I don't know what to make.

240
00:16:42,144 --> 00:16:44,437
Butter was 200 marks
a pound yesterday.

241
00:16:44,605 --> 00:16:48,357
My father's pension is 70 marks
a month, if he even gets it.

242
00:16:48,483 --> 00:16:51,152
And you go out
for four or five cigarettes.

243
00:16:51,278 --> 00:16:52,612
It's 20 marks.

244
00:16:52,779 --> 00:16:55,197
So you can buy
five pounds of potatoes?

245
00:16:55,324 --> 00:16:57,033
You're crazy. Trust me.

246
00:16:57,159 --> 00:17:00,286
Maybe, but don't you see?
I just can't help it.

247
00:17:00,454 --> 00:17:02,997
- Because of Helmut?
- Yes.

248
00:17:03,373 --> 00:17:07,710
Don't you think he understands
your situation, like all POWs?

249
00:17:07,836 --> 00:17:09,920
He won't be back
for a long time.

250
00:17:10,047 --> 00:17:11,672
He'll certainly understand.

251
00:17:11,798 --> 00:17:13,966
It's not about understanding.

252
00:17:14,259 --> 00:17:17,219
The two of us -
How can I explain?

253
00:17:17,346 --> 00:17:19,472
At first it was just
some innocent postcards.

254
00:17:20,015 --> 00:17:22,266
Then I heard nothing
for a long time,

255
00:17:22,392 --> 00:17:24,810
until suddenly a letter came

256
00:17:25,062 --> 00:17:27,146
from the POW camp.

257
00:17:27,481 --> 00:17:30,149
He wrote to me
because he had no one else,

258
00:17:30,317 --> 00:17:32,735
and he had to write to someone.

259
00:17:33,153 --> 00:17:35,404
He had nothing to hold on to

260
00:17:36,323 --> 00:17:38,157
except me.

261
00:17:38,283 --> 00:17:39,867
You understand?

262
00:17:40,160 --> 00:17:42,203
He lives just waiting
for my letters,

263
00:17:42,329 --> 00:17:44,622
and I have someone
I can turn to too.

264
00:17:44,748 --> 00:17:46,707
But you have your family.

265
00:17:46,917 --> 00:17:49,669
- I do what I can for them.
- It's not very much.

266
00:17:49,836 --> 00:17:52,713
I know, but l don't have
the courage to do more.

267
00:17:52,839 --> 00:17:54,965
You have to find the courage.

268
00:17:55,092 --> 00:17:58,594
And after 10 shots of schnapps,
you do, believe me.

269
00:18:00,847 --> 00:18:02,973
Why are you hanging
around here?

270
00:18:03,100 --> 00:18:05,434
Leave me alone, will you?

271
00:18:12,859 --> 00:18:15,319
Hey, kids,
what's going on here?

272
00:18:15,696 --> 00:18:18,406
How much for the scale?
- Three hundred marks.

273
00:18:21,034 --> 00:18:24,412
For that chunk of rust?
Are you crazy?

274
00:18:24,705 --> 00:18:28,457
That chunk of rust works just fine.
Get on and weigh yourself.

275
00:18:28,583 --> 00:18:30,710
Really? Fine, then.

276
00:18:31,128 --> 00:18:33,129
I'll give you something good for it.

277
00:18:33,255 --> 00:18:36,590
Take it easy.
I'm not running off with it.

278
00:18:37,092 --> 00:18:38,926
Just wait a minute.

279
00:18:44,307 --> 00:18:46,809
I'll give you this.
- What is it?

280
00:18:46,935 --> 00:18:49,812
- Top-quality canned meat.
- That's all?

281
00:18:52,441 --> 00:18:55,818
Stop your screeching.
I'll throw in another can.

282
00:18:55,944 --> 00:18:58,404
I'm in a generous mood.
Now get lost.

283
00:18:58,530 --> 00:19:01,490
- That's not enough. I need more!
- Shut your trap.

284
00:19:05,954 --> 00:19:07,913
You're such a dumb ass!

285
00:19:34,024 --> 00:19:35,107
Hello.

286
00:19:35,275 --> 00:19:38,611
- You were in my class once.
- Yes, Mr. Henning.

287
00:19:38,779 --> 00:19:40,863
See, I have a good memory.

288
00:19:40,989 --> 00:19:43,240
What's your name again?

289
00:19:43,867 --> 00:19:45,284
Edmund Kohler.

290
00:19:45,452 --> 00:19:48,162
That's right.
Edmund KohIer.

291
00:19:49,372 --> 00:19:52,625
You've grown up to be a handsome,
strapping young man.

292
00:19:53,293 --> 00:19:55,044
How's your father doing?

293
00:19:55,170 --> 00:19:57,505
My father's very sick.

294
00:19:57,631 --> 00:19:58,839
I see.

295
00:19:58,965 --> 00:20:01,217
You have
a big brother too, right?

296
00:20:01,551 --> 00:20:04,220
Yes, he was in the war.
Now he's at home.

297
00:20:04,346 --> 00:20:06,639
So he's unemployed,
just like me.

298
00:20:06,848 --> 00:20:09,558
- Aren't you a teacher anymore?
- No.

299
00:20:09,935 --> 00:20:12,645
The authorities and l
didn't see eye to eye

300
00:20:12,813 --> 00:20:15,439
about educating today's youth.

301
00:20:16,149 --> 00:20:20,820
Tell me, my young Edmund,
what are you doing here anyway?

302
00:20:20,987 --> 00:20:22,488
Nothing much.

303
00:20:22,656 --> 00:20:25,407
- Keep me company for a while.
- I'd be happy to.

304
00:20:25,534 --> 00:20:28,786
I'm always happy to see
a former pupil again.

305
00:20:38,296 --> 00:20:40,047
Hey, Henning.

306
00:20:43,134 --> 00:20:45,386
You didn't even recognize me.
- Sure I did.

307
00:20:45,512 --> 00:20:48,514
Dirty work, eh?
- Work? Slavery.

308
00:20:48,682 --> 00:20:50,683
A fine situation we're in.

309
00:20:51,726 --> 00:20:54,436
Before, we were still men.
National Socialists.

310
00:20:54,563 --> 00:20:56,647
Now we're just Nazis.

311
00:20:57,566 --> 00:20:59,441
The streetcar's coming.

312
00:20:59,568 --> 00:21:01,151
- all the best.
- See you.

313
00:21:18,378 --> 00:21:19,879
all clear.

314
00:21:51,578 --> 00:21:55,080
- Did you have to shovel too?
- You bet. To clear up the rubble.

315
00:21:55,248 --> 00:21:57,625
- And work on the rooftops too?
- That too.

316
00:21:57,751 --> 00:22:00,294
My brother was supposed to too,
but he didn't register.

317
00:22:00,420 --> 00:22:04,006
Unfortunately they caught me,
but I got on the sick list.

318
00:22:04,132 --> 00:22:06,926
Remember how I scolded your dad
for that fake certificate

319
00:22:07,052 --> 00:22:10,346
when he tried to keep you
out of the Hitler Youth?

320
00:22:10,472 --> 00:22:13,057
You were very honest
and didn't tell me any fibs.

321
00:22:13,183 --> 00:22:16,685
I should have taken stronger measures,
but I didn't, for your sake.

322
00:22:16,811 --> 00:22:18,312
Here we are.

323
00:22:18,438 --> 00:22:20,397
- Have you always lived here?
- No.

324
00:22:20,607 --> 00:22:23,984
- You just moved?
- Yes, a good friend took me in.

325
00:22:48,885 --> 00:22:51,345
- Ah, there you are.
- Hello, ma'am.

326
00:22:51,805 --> 00:22:54,139
- Well, did you go?
- Yes.

327
00:22:54,808 --> 00:22:57,851
- Nice kid. Who is he?
- One of my former students.

328
00:22:57,978 --> 00:23:00,145
A fine boy.
Did you tell them we sent you?

329
00:23:00,313 --> 00:23:01,647
- Sure.
- And?

330
00:23:01,815 --> 00:23:04,650
I go back tomorrow.
Then we'll probably get the stamp.

331
00:23:04,818 --> 00:23:06,735
Did you bring my nail polish?

332
00:23:06,861 --> 00:23:10,364
Of course.
I hope it's the right color.

333
00:23:11,700 --> 00:23:13,993
Excellent. Take a look.

334
00:23:14,744 --> 00:23:16,453
Now, if you'll...

335
00:23:17,539 --> 00:23:19,665
- Good-bye.
- See you later, my boy.

336
00:23:20,834 --> 00:23:23,752
- You like this color?
- Much too showy.

337
00:23:23,878 --> 00:23:27,172
What would you know
about women's things?

338
00:23:28,717 --> 00:23:30,009
Hello.

339
00:23:30,176 --> 00:23:32,886
- Nice kid. Never seen him before.
- Former student.

340
00:23:33,221 --> 00:23:35,973
Is he around?
- Out on the terrace.

341
00:23:49,154 --> 00:23:50,446
Come on.

342
00:23:55,702 --> 00:23:58,370
Come in, my boy.
Give me your bag.

343
00:23:58,538 --> 00:24:00,330
We'll put it right here.

344
00:24:00,540 --> 00:24:02,416
Now tell me.

345
00:24:02,709 --> 00:24:04,960
What have you got to tell me?
- Nothing.

346
00:24:05,086 --> 00:24:06,754
Sit down.

347
00:24:06,880 --> 00:24:11,216
What are they teaching you about
in school now? Democracy?

348
00:24:11,426 --> 00:24:14,511
I can't really say.
I'm not going right now.

349
00:24:14,637 --> 00:24:16,638
Don't you like your new teachers?

350
00:24:16,765 --> 00:24:19,475
- Sure, but I have to work.
- Why?

351
00:24:19,726 --> 00:24:22,519
There are four of us
and just three ration cards.

352
00:24:22,645 --> 00:24:24,646
Poor boy.

353
00:24:24,773 --> 00:24:26,690
Right, because your brother
didn't register.

354
00:24:26,816 --> 00:24:28,525
Yes, he's in hiding.

355
00:24:28,651 --> 00:24:32,196
And he fought to the very end,
right to the corner of our street.

356
00:24:32,322 --> 00:24:34,114
Don't worry.
We'll find a solution.

357
00:24:34,240 --> 00:24:35,783
I've tried everything.

358
00:24:35,909 --> 00:24:38,827
Today I went for a work permit,

359
00:24:39,079 --> 00:24:42,206
and then I went to work
at the cemetery,

360
00:24:42,332 --> 00:24:44,583
but they threw me out again.

361
00:24:47,295 --> 00:24:50,255
- So you're back, young man?
- Yes, Mr. von Laubnitz.

362
00:24:50,423 --> 00:24:53,008
This is a former student of mine.

363
00:24:56,137 --> 00:24:58,764
- Did you get anywhere?
- I think tomorrow.

364
00:24:58,932 --> 00:25:01,016
- So it's still not decided?
- No.

365
00:25:04,187 --> 00:25:06,480
- The matter must be settled.
- Yes, sir.

366
00:25:14,531 --> 00:25:16,490
My dear little Edmund,

367
00:25:16,616 --> 00:25:18,492
I'd really like to help you.

368
00:25:18,618 --> 00:25:21,078
But you must promise
not to tell anyone.

369
00:25:21,204 --> 00:25:22,788
Understand?

370
00:25:22,956 --> 00:25:26,166
It's nothing really,
but I don't want to attract attention.

371
00:25:26,417 --> 00:25:28,585
I'll give you something
you can sell,

372
00:25:28,711 --> 00:25:30,921
but you must say it's yours,
if anyone asks.

373
00:25:31,047 --> 00:25:33,006
Even in this building, okay?
- Yes, sir.

374
00:25:33,133 --> 00:25:36,093
Go to the chancellery,
understand?

375
00:25:36,302 --> 00:25:39,847
You'll find a bunch of Yanks
or Limeys or other idiots there

376
00:25:39,973 --> 00:25:42,599
that you can palm
this record off on.

377
00:25:42,809 --> 00:25:44,434
Get your bag.

378
00:25:46,396 --> 00:25:48,647
It's a speech by HitIer.

379
00:25:49,315 --> 00:25:51,817
Take the record player along.

380
00:25:52,110 --> 00:25:54,528
You can just say
I lent it to you.

381
00:25:55,488 --> 00:25:58,407
Prove to me
you're a smart boy, all right?

382
00:26:03,163 --> 00:26:05,038
- And what did you get?
- Nothing.

383
00:26:05,165 --> 00:26:07,124
Matches your looks, you idiot.

384
00:26:07,250 --> 00:26:09,835
- And how'd you fare?
- Me? Great.

385
00:26:09,961 --> 00:26:11,545
See you tonight, right?

386
00:26:11,671 --> 00:26:14,256
- Jo and Christi, come here.
- What is it?

387
00:26:14,382 --> 00:26:17,217
Take this little guy
to the chancellery.

388
00:26:17,510 --> 00:26:19,303
He has something to sell.

389
00:26:19,429 --> 00:26:21,722
Make sure he does it right.
He's just a beginner.

390
00:26:21,848 --> 00:26:24,433
- You can count on us.
- Go with them, okay?

391
00:27:33,461 --> 00:27:35,712
When I grow up,
I'm gonna buy a car.

392
00:27:35,838 --> 00:27:38,674
- I can't wait that long.
- Edmund.

393
00:27:38,800 --> 00:27:40,175
Wait here a minute.

394
00:27:40,301 --> 00:27:43,095
Edmund, come quickly.
Hurry.

395
00:27:47,267 --> 00:27:48,767
Here he is.

396
00:27:50,436 --> 00:27:53,605
Yes, you can listen to it.
Hurry up.

397
00:27:53,731 --> 00:27:57,150
- I'm not an express train.
- Don't be such a slowpoke.

398
00:28:01,948 --> 00:28:06,743
... hold the flag high when
the storm rages and thunder strikes.

399
00:28:06,869 --> 00:28:09,371
I am proud to be
the leader of this nation,

400
00:28:09,497 --> 00:28:11,873
not only in happy times,
but especially in hard ones.

401
00:28:12,000 --> 00:28:15,419
I'm happy that in such times
I can once again

402
00:28:15,545 --> 00:28:17,754
give my strength and trust
to the nation,

403
00:28:17,880 --> 00:28:21,258
that I can and must raise up
the entire German people

404
00:28:21,384 --> 00:28:26,179
and tell them, "German people,
set your hearts at rest!

405
00:28:26,306 --> 00:28:28,807
We shall overcome!
Victory awaits us in the end!"

406
00:28:41,446 --> 00:28:44,448
Kids! What a coincidence!

407
00:28:44,615 --> 00:28:47,409
Where have you been?
- At the chancellery.

408
00:28:47,535 --> 00:28:49,494
- So it all worked out?
- Yes, sir.

409
00:28:49,662 --> 00:28:52,414
- How much did you get?
- Two hundred marks.

410
00:28:52,540 --> 00:28:54,541
- Where are they?
- Here.

411
00:28:59,213 --> 00:29:02,341
Here are 10 marks for you.

412
00:29:02,842 --> 00:29:04,634
See?
I take good care of you.

413
00:29:04,761 --> 00:29:07,304
Come see me again soon.

414
00:29:07,430 --> 00:29:08,930
Bye.

415
00:29:10,391 --> 00:29:12,351
- Jo!
- Come on.

416
00:29:19,650 --> 00:29:21,693
Wait here a minute.

417
00:29:22,320 --> 00:29:25,238
- Why do we have to wait?
- Jo's pulling off a job.

418
00:29:25,365 --> 00:29:27,741
- What job?
- Don't ask stupid questions.

419
00:29:27,867 --> 00:29:30,202
If you're so curious,
go after him.

420
00:29:30,328 --> 00:29:31,536
I will.

421
00:29:59,023 --> 00:30:00,023
Jo!

422
00:30:00,149 --> 00:30:02,025
I told you to wait outside.

423
00:30:02,151 --> 00:30:04,152
What are you doing
down here?

424
00:30:04,487 --> 00:30:06,488
- Selling something.
- What?

425
00:30:06,614 --> 00:30:08,073
- This.
- What is it?

426
00:30:08,241 --> 00:30:09,533
Soap.

427
00:30:09,659 --> 00:30:11,910
Soap?
That's why I had to -

428
00:30:12,245 --> 00:30:15,205
Pipe down. You'll see
what you can do with soap.

429
00:30:15,331 --> 00:30:18,417
Now beat it.
You too, silly goose.

430
00:30:25,341 --> 00:30:28,677
This stop Zoologischer Garten!

431
00:30:33,391 --> 00:30:35,434
- Fifty marks.
- I don't have it.

432
00:30:35,560 --> 00:30:37,352
Just take a Look.

433
00:30:38,729 --> 00:30:41,940
- Smell.
- Nice, but too expensive.

434
00:30:42,108 --> 00:30:44,276
For you I'll make it 40.

435
00:31:14,849 --> 00:31:16,766
Come on. Hurry up.

436
00:31:18,811 --> 00:31:21,605
Now you see how
to soap the people up?

437
00:31:25,985 --> 00:31:29,029
No one here?
The gang was supposed to be here.

438
00:31:29,155 --> 00:31:32,365
Wait for me.
I'll see where all Baba's hiding.

439
00:31:32,909 --> 00:31:35,869
- Is he your brother?
- Jo? No.

440
00:31:35,995 --> 00:31:37,496
Don't you live together?

441
00:31:37,622 --> 00:31:39,164
Us? Live together?

442
00:31:39,290 --> 00:31:41,500
I thought you lived together.

443
00:31:41,667 --> 00:31:44,252
We don't live together.
Hey, Jo!

444
00:31:46,047 --> 00:31:48,048
- Hey, sweetie!
- Hands off!

445
00:31:48,174 --> 00:31:49,466
Don't be that way!

446
00:31:49,592 --> 00:31:53,011
- Conceited princess.
- A mattress that dispenses cigarettes.

447
00:31:53,137 --> 00:31:55,305
She's not the only broad
I've been with.

448
00:31:55,431 --> 00:31:57,891
A trainload of potatoes
is coming in tonight.

449
00:31:58,017 --> 00:32:00,519
Crazy!
We'll get ourselves some.

450
00:32:00,686 --> 00:32:02,312
The cops will be there too.

451
00:32:56,659 --> 00:32:59,578
- Jo?
- I know where to find him.

452
00:33:10,006 --> 00:33:12,090
- Hey, Jo.
- What?

453
00:33:12,216 --> 00:33:14,259
will you sell me
a piece of soap?

454
00:33:14,427 --> 00:33:16,386
- Why not?
- How much you want?

455
00:33:16,512 --> 00:33:17,762
Forty smackers.

456
00:33:17,930 --> 00:33:20,432
Forty? I only have 10.

457
00:33:20,558 --> 00:33:22,517
You'll get the rest
tomorrow and the day after.

458
00:33:22,643 --> 00:33:24,102
all right.

459
00:33:24,228 --> 00:33:25,604
Good.

460
00:33:26,814 --> 00:33:30,567
- Now put it away.
- I want to take a Look first.

461
00:33:32,445 --> 00:33:35,196
You dirty dog,
you cheated me!

462
00:33:36,866 --> 00:33:38,658
Good night and sweet dreams.

463
00:33:38,784 --> 00:33:40,327
Where are you going?

464
00:33:40,453 --> 00:33:42,412
I have a rendezvous.

465
00:33:42,705 --> 00:33:45,624
- Where are we anyway?
- Good question.

466
00:33:46,542 --> 00:33:48,835
I live near the AIexanderpIatz.
How do I get home?

467
00:33:48,961 --> 00:33:51,421
No one's making you go home.

468
00:33:52,256 --> 00:33:56,051
- Where am I supposed to sleep?
- There's plenty of room here.

469
00:33:56,302 --> 00:33:57,969
Alone?

470
00:33:58,220 --> 00:34:00,597
With her.
Or don't you like her?

471
00:34:00,723 --> 00:34:02,974
Afraid of girls?
- It's not that.

472
00:34:03,267 --> 00:34:06,019
She's a nice girI,
you dummkopf.

473
00:34:07,897 --> 00:34:09,814
Now get lost, you two.

474
00:34:10,650 --> 00:34:14,319
You gonna keep
all those potatoes yourself?

475
00:34:14,612 --> 00:34:18,031
You can have a few.
Where should I put them?

476
00:34:18,157 --> 00:34:19,741
In here.

477
00:34:25,373 --> 00:34:26,706
That's all?

478
00:34:26,832 --> 00:34:28,667
Where would you put more?

479
00:34:28,876 --> 00:34:30,001
In my bag.

480
00:34:30,169 --> 00:34:32,837
I'll give you more tomorrow.
I promise.

481
00:34:33,005 --> 00:34:35,882
Now good night,
and make each other happy.

482
00:34:36,008 --> 00:34:37,884
You'll see.
It's lots of fun.

483
00:34:38,010 --> 00:34:38,968
Come on.

484
00:34:39,095 --> 00:34:41,513
Jo, listen!

485
00:34:43,140 --> 00:34:44,391
Come on.

486
00:34:59,031 --> 00:35:01,616
They're gonna really
hit the roof, my boy.

487
00:35:01,867 --> 00:35:03,118
You think so?

488
00:35:03,244 --> 00:35:05,829
Staying out all night
won't go unpunished.

489
00:35:05,955 --> 00:35:08,998
- What should I do?
- You'll have to pay the piper.

490
00:35:10,042 --> 00:35:12,460
I only stayed out
all night because -

491
00:35:12,586 --> 00:35:16,256
You needn't tell me.
Explain it to your sister.

492
00:35:17,800 --> 00:35:19,384
Come on.

493
00:35:33,441 --> 00:35:35,442
Edmund! Finally!

494
00:35:35,693 --> 00:35:37,944
I thought you weren't
coming home.

495
00:35:38,237 --> 00:35:40,113
You gave me such a fright.

496
00:35:40,239 --> 00:35:42,866
You're a horrible boy.
- What's going on?

497
00:35:42,992 --> 00:35:46,411
Nothing. It's just Edmund.
Go back to sleep.

498
00:35:46,996 --> 00:35:48,913
To your room - march!

499
00:35:52,877 --> 00:35:55,420
Where were you the whole night?

500
00:35:55,588 --> 00:35:58,089
I didn't do anything bad,
Eva, honest.

501
00:35:58,591 --> 00:36:00,508
I want to know where you were.

502
00:36:00,634 --> 00:36:02,051
I was getting potatoes.

503
00:36:02,178 --> 00:36:04,304
That's no reason
to stay out all night.

504
00:36:04,430 --> 00:36:06,264
Tomorrow I'll get more.

505
00:36:06,932 --> 00:36:08,933
Look.

506
00:36:12,521 --> 00:36:13,938
Father's awake.

507
00:36:14,106 --> 00:36:15,940
Hear him coughing?

508
00:36:16,066 --> 00:36:18,109
He was very ill last night.

509
00:36:18,319 --> 00:36:20,612
- Does he know?
- Yes.

510
00:36:22,907 --> 00:36:24,365
Yes, Father.

511
00:36:24,784 --> 00:36:26,451
Edmund's here.

512
00:36:29,121 --> 00:36:30,622
Come here.

513
00:36:32,625 --> 00:36:33,750
Closer.

514
00:36:36,504 --> 00:36:38,880
It's not my fault.
The other boys made me -

515
00:36:39,006 --> 00:36:41,966
Save your breath.
I'm not interested in your lies.

516
00:36:42,134 --> 00:36:43,593
You should be ashamed -

517
00:36:43,719 --> 00:36:46,304
so depraved
and corrupted at your age!

518
00:36:46,472 --> 00:36:48,640
He didn't mean any harm, Father.

519
00:36:48,766 --> 00:36:51,392
He was finding us some food.
- I won't eat any of it.

520
00:36:51,769 --> 00:36:54,646
Me neither.
I'd rather starve.

521
00:36:54,814 --> 00:36:56,147
Easy to say.

522
00:36:56,273 --> 00:36:59,567
I'm tired of lying around,
of no use to anyone.

523
00:37:00,653 --> 00:37:03,321
Don't get upset.
I'm sure he won't do it again.

524
00:37:03,489 --> 00:37:05,949
Show how many
potatoes you brought.

525
00:37:06,867 --> 00:37:08,368
And canned meat.

526
00:37:08,494 --> 00:37:10,411
That's not for us.

527
00:37:10,579 --> 00:37:13,081
- Who's it for?
- Mr. Rademacher.

528
00:37:16,877 --> 00:37:19,629
Well? Any luck?

529
00:37:19,755 --> 00:37:23,091
- It's not so easy.
- The main cable has to be in there.

530
00:37:23,217 --> 00:37:25,176
Yes, but it's hard to get at.

531
00:37:25,344 --> 00:37:27,887
And the power company might
easily notice we're tapping it.

532
00:37:28,013 --> 00:37:29,639
No need to worry.

533
00:37:29,765 --> 00:37:32,350
With five households,
it could have been any one of us.

534
00:37:32,476 --> 00:37:34,352
- Here, Mr. Rademacher.
- What do you want?

535
00:37:34,478 --> 00:37:36,521
- I brought canned meat.
- I didn't order any.

536
00:37:36,689 --> 00:37:39,232
- For the scale.
- Where are the 300 marks?

537
00:37:39,358 --> 00:37:41,192
This is all I got for it.

538
00:37:41,360 --> 00:37:44,445
What? You dare bring me this
for my expensive scale?

539
00:37:44,572 --> 00:37:46,781
Canned meat?
You want to poison us all?

540
00:37:46,907 --> 00:37:49,284
- It's not bad.
- Then you take it...

541
00:37:49,410 --> 00:37:50,702
Very kind of you.

542
00:37:50,870 --> 00:37:52,704
... to my wife.

543
00:37:53,747 --> 00:37:57,000
Out with the truth.
Where's the money?

544
00:37:57,209 --> 00:37:58,418
What money?

545
00:37:58,544 --> 00:38:00,378
For the scale.
I bet it's in your pocket.

546
00:38:00,504 --> 00:38:02,922
- How can you accuse me?
- It's perfectly clear.

547
00:38:03,048 --> 00:38:06,342
You're all dying of hunger
and trying to get by at any cost.

548
00:38:06,468 --> 00:38:08,219
First you forced yourself on us.

549
00:38:08,345 --> 00:38:10,054
That was the housing authority.

550
00:38:10,180 --> 00:38:11,890
I'm the one who has to bear it.

551
00:38:12,016 --> 00:38:13,850
We all have to put up

552
00:38:13,976 --> 00:38:16,394
with your father's constant
bellyaching and whimpering.

553
00:38:16,562 --> 00:38:20,023
Why doesn't he just croak?
We'd finally have some peace.

554
00:38:32,578 --> 00:38:35,330
- Where are you going?
- To the bathroom.

555
00:38:35,581 --> 00:38:37,248
Wait. I'll help you.

556
00:38:37,416 --> 00:38:39,292
Thank you, child.

557
00:38:46,050 --> 00:38:49,052
- Your soup is on the stove.
- Close the door.

558
00:38:55,100 --> 00:38:56,434
Want some?

559
00:38:56,602 --> 00:38:59,228
No, Eva warmed it up
especially for you.

560
00:38:59,355 --> 00:39:01,189
How about
an American cigarette?

561
00:39:01,315 --> 00:39:03,232
So Eva can hold it over me?

562
00:39:03,359 --> 00:39:05,026
It's not from Eva.

563
00:39:05,194 --> 00:39:06,986
Don't tell me you bought it.

564
00:39:07,112 --> 00:39:08,780
No, it was a present.

565
00:39:08,906 --> 00:39:11,115
From the boys
you were running around with?

566
00:39:11,283 --> 00:39:13,785
It wasn't the boys.
It was a girl.

567
00:39:14,119 --> 00:39:16,579
- You should be ashamed!
- Everyone else does it.

568
00:39:16,705 --> 00:39:18,039
That's no excuse.

569
00:39:18,791 --> 00:39:20,875
Her name's Christi.
She lost her parents.

570
00:39:21,001 --> 00:39:22,961
She lives in a basement.

571
00:39:24,964 --> 00:39:27,465
She laughed at me
because I don't smoke yet.

572
00:39:27,591 --> 00:39:30,218
She often brings cigarettes
for the other guys.

573
00:39:31,136 --> 00:39:33,554
You should have someone
who'd look after you.

574
00:39:33,681 --> 00:39:36,474
Me? I don't need anyone.

575
00:39:37,434 --> 00:39:39,519
I've had enough of this rotten life.

576
00:39:39,728 --> 00:39:41,688
You mustn't lose courage now.

577
00:39:41,814 --> 00:39:43,356
No, I mustn't.

578
00:39:43,482 --> 00:39:45,942
A soldier can lose everything
but his courage.

579
00:39:46,068 --> 00:39:47,986
But I'm not a soldier anymore.

580
00:39:48,153 --> 00:39:51,990
Now I'm a nobody.
One more mouth to feed.

581
00:39:52,157 --> 00:39:54,325
I'd like to jump out the window!

582
00:39:54,493 --> 00:39:56,160
Come quickly!

583
00:39:56,453 --> 00:39:58,162
Come quickly.

584
00:39:58,580 --> 00:40:00,748
Father had another attack.

585
00:40:05,838 --> 00:40:08,756
I think we should call a doctor.
You hear me?

586
00:40:08,882 --> 00:40:10,174
Yes, but -

587
00:40:10,300 --> 00:40:12,635
I'll get him.
I know where he lives.

588
00:40:26,734 --> 00:40:29,569
Don't worry.
It's nothing serious.

589
00:40:32,865 --> 00:40:34,866
His heart is very weak,

590
00:40:34,992 --> 00:40:38,661
but it's his poor overall condition
that concerns me most.

591
00:40:38,787 --> 00:40:40,246
What should we do?

592
00:40:40,372 --> 00:40:44,250
He needs nourishing food,
with fats and vitamins.

593
00:40:44,376 --> 00:40:47,587
- How can we get that?
- We only have a Level 3 card.

594
00:40:47,713 --> 00:40:50,339
I know. It's the same
sorry state everywhere.

595
00:40:50,466 --> 00:40:53,551
It would be best
to get him to a hospital,

596
00:40:53,719 --> 00:40:55,887
but they're all
full to overflowing.

597
00:40:56,055 --> 00:40:58,431
You think there's any possibility?

598
00:40:58,557 --> 00:41:02,393
They've turned away
worse cases,

599
00:41:03,020 --> 00:41:06,856
but fortunately I have very good
connections at the Health Department.

600
00:41:06,982 --> 00:41:09,567
Hear that, Father?
You're going to the hospital.

601
00:41:09,693 --> 00:41:11,527
You can eat all you want there.

602
00:41:11,653 --> 00:41:13,571
Three meals a day.

603
00:41:13,781 --> 00:41:15,239
Just a minute.

604
00:41:15,365 --> 00:41:18,242
I can't make any promises,

605
00:41:18,410 --> 00:41:21,704
but I'd be surprised
if I can't manage it.

606
00:41:21,830 --> 00:41:24,207
Get well soon. Good-bye.

607
00:41:31,090 --> 00:41:32,882
Happy now, Daddy?

608
00:41:36,345 --> 00:41:39,263
- So you feel better?
- Much better.

609
00:41:39,431 --> 00:41:40,932
Not so loud, Father.

610
00:41:41,058 --> 00:41:42,725
Remember what the doctor said.

611
00:41:42,851 --> 00:41:44,977
You're right.
Someone might hear us.

612
00:41:45,104 --> 00:41:47,688
But you simply can't imagine.

613
00:41:47,815 --> 00:41:50,358
- What?
- all I've had to eat.

614
00:41:50,567 --> 00:41:52,151
First soup,

615
00:41:52,277 --> 00:41:55,613
then meat with fresh vegetables,

616
00:41:55,906 --> 00:41:58,074
and this much milk.

617
00:41:58,200 --> 00:42:00,368
- Really?
- What do you think of that?

618
00:42:00,494 --> 00:42:02,537
I'm happy you have it so good.

619
00:42:02,663 --> 00:42:04,789
And in the evening
there's another hot meal.

620
00:42:04,915 --> 00:42:07,083
You'll see.
You'll be better soon.

621
00:42:07,209 --> 00:42:10,211
Yes. But when I think
of all of you -

622
00:42:10,337 --> 00:42:12,130
Don't worry about us.

623
00:42:12,256 --> 00:42:15,299
As long as you feel better,
that's a comfort for us.

624
00:42:15,425 --> 00:42:18,344
It makes things a little easier,
doesn't it?

625
00:42:18,470 --> 00:42:20,680
- Yes, Father.
- That's what I tell myself too.

626
00:42:20,806 --> 00:42:23,724
- You think Eva's still coming?
- Yes. She just went to the hospital.

627
00:42:23,851 --> 00:42:25,768
- May I smoke?
- Of course.

628
00:42:25,894 --> 00:42:28,771
- Join me?
- Thanks, I just had one.

629
00:42:31,900 --> 00:42:33,693
I'll get you a light.

630
00:42:36,947 --> 00:42:38,948
Where are the matches?
- They're all gone.

631
00:42:39,074 --> 00:42:40,908
- Go get some.
- With no money?

632
00:42:41,034 --> 00:42:42,660
- Go ask Rademacher -
- No need.

633
00:42:42,828 --> 00:42:46,164
My friend has some.
I have to go see her anyway.

634
00:42:46,331 --> 00:42:48,082
Oh, here you are.
- What is it?

635
00:42:48,208 --> 00:42:50,126
I'll tell you later.
I'm going to Hilde's.

636
00:42:50,252 --> 00:42:51,377
all right.

637
00:42:51,503 --> 00:42:53,421
- How's Father?
- He's doing better.

638
00:42:53,547 --> 00:42:54,672
And we're doing worse.

639
00:42:54,840 --> 00:42:57,842
- They cut off the power.
- How can that be?

640
00:42:58,010 --> 00:43:01,721
They found out someone here
was plugging in for free.

641
00:43:01,847 --> 00:43:03,848
- Rademacher suspected us.
- Of course.

642
00:43:03,974 --> 00:43:05,474
That's why he's yelling.

643
00:43:05,601 --> 00:43:08,561
That swindler!
Someone ought to shut his trap.

644
00:43:08,687 --> 00:43:10,563
Lots of big words,

645
00:43:10,689 --> 00:43:12,857
but you just sit around
while everything happens to us.

646
00:43:12,983 --> 00:43:14,358
You starting again?

647
00:43:14,484 --> 00:43:16,110
You must have done
something wrong.

648
00:43:16,236 --> 00:43:18,863
- I only did my duty.
- Then you have nothing to fear.

649
00:43:19,031 --> 00:43:20,698
I inquired again yesterday.

650
00:43:20,866 --> 00:43:23,910
- With that refugee woman?
- No, with an allied officer.

651
00:43:24,036 --> 00:43:26,412
Your moral guides -
allied officers.

652
00:43:26,538 --> 00:43:28,623
Our troubles
don't even bother you.

653
00:43:28,749 --> 00:43:31,834
For a while at least
Father's been in the hospital.

654
00:43:31,960 --> 00:43:34,545
But he comes back tomorrow,
and we have nothing in the house.

655
00:43:34,671 --> 00:43:37,340
I'll find something.
Now I know how.

656
00:43:37,466 --> 00:43:38,925
And that's fine with you?

657
00:43:39,051 --> 00:43:42,845
Let Edmund do the dirty work
and get more and more corrupted?

658
00:43:42,971 --> 00:43:44,639
Leave me alone.

659
00:43:45,057 --> 00:43:47,225
Go dancing with your Yanks.

660
00:43:53,315 --> 00:43:55,233
Mr. Henning!

661
00:43:55,901 --> 00:43:58,611
- What is it?
- Could I speak with you?

662
00:43:58,737 --> 00:44:00,780
Sure. Come back later
or tomorrow.

663
00:44:00,906 --> 00:44:01,906
Listen...

664
00:44:02,032 --> 00:44:04,033
Can't you see I'm busy?

665
00:44:04,159 --> 00:44:05,910
It's about my father.

666
00:44:06,078 --> 00:44:08,454
- Okay, tell me.
- Come with me.

667
00:44:09,456 --> 00:44:11,332
Wait here a minute, okay?

668
00:44:12,084 --> 00:44:13,084
What is it?

669
00:44:13,210 --> 00:44:15,419
My father comes home
from the hospital tomorrow.

670
00:44:15,587 --> 00:44:16,671
And?

671
00:44:16,797 --> 00:44:20,591
We have nothing in the house -
no bread, jam, margarine.

672
00:44:20,759 --> 00:44:23,427
It's all my brother's fault.

673
00:44:23,553 --> 00:44:25,513
What am I supposed to do?

674
00:44:25,639 --> 00:44:27,765
We have to get him
something to eat.

675
00:44:27,891 --> 00:44:30,518
Can't you help?
Tell me what I should do.

676
00:44:30,644 --> 00:44:32,478
I have no idea, my boy.

677
00:44:32,604 --> 00:44:34,689
You have to accept things
as they come.

678
00:44:34,815 --> 00:44:36,941
He's old and weak.
You've tried everything.

679
00:44:37,109 --> 00:44:38,859
You can't fight destiny.

680
00:44:38,986 --> 00:44:40,778
- What if he dies?
- Then he dies.

681
00:44:40,946 --> 00:44:43,114
We all have to sooner or later.

682
00:44:43,282 --> 00:44:46,409
You can't all starve
just to keep him alive.

683
00:44:46,535 --> 00:44:47,910
Mr. von Laubnitz.

684
00:44:49,079 --> 00:44:52,498
- Another of your students?
- No, a little friend.

685
00:44:52,624 --> 00:44:55,626
Come along, my boy.
I have something for you.

686
00:45:03,677 --> 00:45:05,136
I hope you understood.

687
00:45:05,304 --> 00:45:08,389
Stop this now.
You can't change things.

688
00:45:08,640 --> 00:45:10,975
Everything isn't about you
and your selfishness.

689
00:45:11,143 --> 00:45:13,311
Afraid that Daddy will die!

690
00:45:13,603 --> 00:45:14,979
Look at nature.

691
00:45:15,147 --> 00:45:17,481
The weak are destroyed
so that the strong survive.

692
00:45:17,607 --> 00:45:19,942
One must have the courage
to let the weak die.

693
00:45:20,068 --> 00:45:22,528
You have to be clear
about that.

694
00:45:23,447 --> 00:45:25,656
It's all about saving ourselves.

695
00:45:25,782 --> 00:45:27,825
So chin up, okay?

696
00:45:28,368 --> 00:45:30,161
Think about your brother.

697
00:45:30,329 --> 00:45:31,787
Bye.

698
00:46:05,781 --> 00:46:06,947
Father.

699
00:46:08,158 --> 00:46:10,659
Come, my boy. Sit down.

700
00:46:11,578 --> 00:46:13,329
Come closer.

701
00:46:14,247 --> 00:46:15,873
Give me a kiss.

702
00:46:16,541 --> 00:46:20,378
It's so nice of you
to come visit me.

703
00:46:20,837 --> 00:46:24,048
Four days here
have done wonders for me,

704
00:46:24,174 --> 00:46:27,301
and it was easier
on you at home too.

705
00:46:27,427 --> 00:46:29,053
Father, you know -

706
00:46:29,221 --> 00:46:32,390
Let's see how
your temperature is today.

707
00:46:32,557 --> 00:46:35,893
Is the little one your son?
- Yes, my youngest.

708
00:46:36,395 --> 00:46:38,104
A nice boy.

709
00:46:38,522 --> 00:46:41,190
Sit down.
You're not in my way.

710
00:46:41,650 --> 00:46:44,693
Now I'll be a burden
on all of you again.

711
00:46:44,820 --> 00:46:47,029
That's the worst part.

712
00:46:47,280 --> 00:46:49,865
It would be better
if I were dead.

713
00:46:50,117 --> 00:46:51,617
I've often thought

714
00:46:51,743 --> 00:46:53,577
I ought to end my life,
POISON

715
00:46:54,413 --> 00:46:56,747
but I lack the courage.

716
00:46:56,915 --> 00:46:59,834
My existence is nothing but agony.

717
00:46:59,960 --> 00:47:01,961
I know it full well.

718
00:47:02,462 --> 00:47:04,046
For me...

719
00:47:04,506 --> 00:47:06,048
and for all of you.

720
00:47:11,388 --> 00:47:12,930
Here, Father.

721
00:47:15,100 --> 00:47:17,476
We can eat now.
- Shall we move the table?

722
00:47:17,602 --> 00:47:18,602
Yes.

723
00:47:18,770 --> 00:47:20,396
Grab that end, Edmund.

724
00:47:26,695 --> 00:47:28,487
A little further?

725
00:47:37,831 --> 00:47:39,874
Wait, Father. I'll help you.

726
00:47:41,126 --> 00:47:42,626
Just potatoes?

727
00:47:42,752 --> 00:47:44,628
I couldn’t make you any soup.

728
00:47:44,796 --> 00:47:47,631
Why not? The gas
hasn't been shut off, has it?

729
00:47:47,757 --> 00:47:50,718
No, but we have
no more flour or oil.

730
00:47:50,844 --> 00:47:52,970
At least a little tea.

731
00:47:53,263 --> 00:47:54,972
That's all gone too.

732
00:47:55,515 --> 00:48:00,269
My God, why didn't I
just stay in the hospital?

733
00:48:01,354 --> 00:48:05,816
Now I have to lie around here
and be a burden to you again.

734
00:48:06,902 --> 00:48:10,779
The misery of watching
and not being able to help.

735
00:48:11,406 --> 00:48:13,574
Condemned to live.

736
00:48:15,994 --> 00:48:17,828
Lord...

737
00:48:18,121 --> 00:48:20,122
why don't you just let me die?

738
00:48:20,248 --> 00:48:22,333
Don't talk like that, Father.

739
00:48:22,501 --> 00:48:24,835
It would be a relief...

740
00:48:25,587 --> 00:48:27,463
for me and all of you.

741
00:48:27,589 --> 00:48:29,548
We'll manage.

742
00:48:31,092 --> 00:48:34,345
If only Karl-Heinz had registered.

743
00:48:34,930 --> 00:48:39,850
I thought my absence would
make him aware of his responsibility.

744
00:48:40,185 --> 00:48:44,688
What would have happened
if I hadn't come back or I'd died?

745
00:48:45,023 --> 00:48:47,399
Can you tell me that,
Karl-Heinz?

746
00:48:47,651 --> 00:48:51,695
Or would you leave Eva and Edmund
to face their fate alone?

747
00:48:51,863 --> 00:48:53,155
Of course not.

748
00:48:53,281 --> 00:48:56,700
If only your mother were still alive,

749
00:48:57,035 --> 00:48:59,328
but she was taken from me too.

750
00:48:59,454 --> 00:49:01,497
Everything's been taken from me.

751
00:49:01,623 --> 00:49:04,208
Inflation took away my life savings...

752
00:49:04,543 --> 00:49:07,253
and HitIer took away my sons.

753
00:49:07,921 --> 00:49:10,047
I should have rebelled,

754
00:49:10,215 --> 00:49:14,635
but I was too weak,
like so many of my generation.

755
00:49:15,303 --> 00:49:19,014
We saw disaster coming
and did nothing to prevent it.

756
00:49:19,391 --> 00:49:22,142
Only now do we see
the consequences.

757
00:49:22,269 --> 00:49:24,812
Now we're paying for our mistakes.

758
00:49:24,938 --> 00:49:28,148
all of us,
me just as much as you.

759
00:49:28,400 --> 00:49:31,986
We just have
to acknowledge our guilt.

760
00:49:32,195 --> 00:49:35,447
Merely complaining
accomplishes nothing.

761
00:49:35,740 --> 00:49:37,408
Yes, I know, Father.

762
00:49:37,534 --> 00:49:41,370
My days are numbered,
but you're still young.

763
00:49:42,080 --> 00:49:44,748
You can still set
a lot of things right.

764
00:49:44,916 --> 00:49:47,251
Prove you're a man.

765
00:49:47,419 --> 00:49:50,379
Have the courage to register.

766
00:49:50,797 --> 00:49:54,967
You'll see how much easier
it makes life

767
00:49:55,218 --> 00:49:57,595
for you and your family.

768
00:49:58,054 --> 00:50:01,432
Eva and Edmund will be grateful.

769
00:50:02,142 --> 00:50:04,101
And I'll be proud too,

770
00:50:04,227 --> 00:50:05,936
my son.

771
00:50:06,229 --> 00:50:10,190
You'll give me new courage to live.

772
00:50:10,525 --> 00:50:12,401
You'll work.

773
00:50:12,569 --> 00:50:16,655
You'll get a ration card
like everyone else.

774
00:50:17,365 --> 00:50:19,325
So stop putting it off.

775
00:50:19,451 --> 00:50:22,828
Stop living like a hunted animal.

776
00:50:23,413 --> 00:50:28,459
Try to be a man again
who can show his face anywhere.

777
00:50:29,085 --> 00:50:33,255
There's no shame
in accepting one's fate.

778
00:50:33,381 --> 00:50:39,094
You know I was an officer
in World War I.

779
00:50:39,220 --> 00:50:43,682
You think it was just child’s play,
but it was plenty for me.

780
00:50:43,975 --> 00:50:47,353
Back then too we marched
along to waving flags,

781
00:50:47,479 --> 00:50:49,563
conquered half of Europe,

782
00:50:49,689 --> 00:50:52,024
and got all the way to Russia.

783
00:50:52,150 --> 00:50:55,611
It seemed like no power
in the world could oppose us.

784
00:50:55,737 --> 00:50:58,697
Then suddenly the end came.

785
00:50:59,324 --> 00:51:01,325
First defeat...

786
00:51:01,660 --> 00:51:03,827
then revolution.

787
00:51:04,204 --> 00:51:05,996
I wept

788
00:51:06,331 --> 00:51:09,667
when they tore off my epaulets.

789
00:51:10,126 --> 00:51:13,671
No one can accuse me
of not being a good German.

790
00:51:14,005 --> 00:51:19,009
But during all these difficult years,
I longed for just one thing,

791
00:51:19,511 --> 00:51:21,845
and I can confess it to you now:

792
00:51:21,971 --> 00:51:24,723
the collapse of the Third Reich

793
00:51:24,849 --> 00:51:26,975
and defeat.

794
00:51:27,435 --> 00:51:31,188
I don't want to know
how the world would Look

795
00:51:31,356 --> 00:51:34,358
if things had turned out otherwise.

796
00:51:34,609 --> 00:51:36,193
Here, Father.

797
00:51:37,570 --> 00:51:38,570
Tea?

798
00:51:38,697 --> 00:51:40,948
Edmund got it for you.

799
00:51:46,705 --> 00:51:48,664
Tastes odd.

800
00:51:51,918 --> 00:51:55,504
But it's warm,
and that does a man good.

801
00:51:57,549 --> 00:52:00,134
You want some, Karl-Heinz?

802
00:52:00,385 --> 00:52:02,803
No, I got it specially for you.

803
00:52:05,056 --> 00:52:07,015
You're a good boy.

804
00:52:07,434 --> 00:52:09,101
Thank you.

805
00:52:09,561 --> 00:52:12,104
All three of you
are so good to me.

806
00:52:13,857 --> 00:52:16,400
I can be proud
to have children like you.

807
00:52:18,737 --> 00:52:21,321
Misfortune has befallen us,

808
00:52:21,614 --> 00:52:25,534
but it has brought
my children back to me.

809
00:52:27,495 --> 00:52:28,495
Come in.

810
00:52:28,621 --> 00:52:31,123
It's a raid. The police
are searching door to door.

811
00:52:31,249 --> 00:52:33,292
- Good heavens!
- You have to hide.

812
00:52:33,418 --> 00:52:35,419
I'm not hiding anymore.

813
00:52:58,109 --> 00:52:59,860
Open up. Police.

814
00:52:59,986 --> 00:53:01,612
Take it easy.

815
00:53:05,408 --> 00:53:07,451
We have to search the building.

816
00:53:07,619 --> 00:53:09,495
Everything's in order here.

817
00:53:09,829 --> 00:53:12,080
No need to make trouble.

818
00:53:13,666 --> 00:53:15,334
I don't have papers.

819
00:53:15,460 --> 00:53:17,169
Take care of this man.

820
00:53:17,295 --> 00:53:19,963
No papers?
Where are they?

821
00:53:20,089 --> 00:53:21,757
I burned my documents.

822
00:53:21,883 --> 00:53:23,675
Then you must come
to the station.

823
00:53:23,802 --> 00:53:26,929
- May I let my family know?
- Yes, but I'll go with you.

824
00:53:27,055 --> 00:53:28,388
Go ahead.

825
00:53:39,150 --> 00:53:42,694
- It's the rooms behind the kitchen.
- Go ahead, and hurry.

826
00:53:44,614 --> 00:53:47,282
- The power's off.
- Who's the head tenant here?

827
00:53:47,408 --> 00:53:49,034
- I am.
- It's our apartment.

828
00:53:49,160 --> 00:53:52,162
- Who else lives here?
- Just some noisy broads.

829
00:53:52,330 --> 00:53:53,872
- Your occupation?
- Artist.

830
00:53:53,998 --> 00:53:55,499
Yeah, a freeload artist.

831
00:53:55,667 --> 00:53:57,709
In there's a refugee woman
with her child.

832
00:53:57,836 --> 00:54:00,712
- And next to them?
- A very pregnant young woman.

833
00:54:00,839 --> 00:54:02,881
Her husband's in a POW camp.

834
00:54:03,007 --> 00:54:05,968
- We can go.
- Karl-Heinz, stay here.

835
00:54:06,094 --> 00:54:07,761
He didn't do anything.

836
00:54:07,887 --> 00:54:10,764
Then we won't do anything to him.
Come along.

837
00:54:12,183 --> 00:54:15,269
Don't worry.
Nothing will happen to me.

838
00:54:35,164 --> 00:54:37,374
It's my father! Help me!

839
00:54:39,043 --> 00:54:40,919
My father!

840
00:54:41,045 --> 00:54:42,588
What are you screaming about?

841
00:54:42,714 --> 00:54:45,257
My father! He's not moving.

842
00:54:45,717 --> 00:54:47,718
I'm afraid he might be dead.

843
00:54:47,844 --> 00:54:49,553
I'm so afraid.

844
00:54:54,267 --> 00:54:57,227
The old man's dead,
no doubt about it.

845
00:54:57,478 --> 00:54:59,396
Don't be upset, Eva.

846
00:54:59,564 --> 00:55:02,024
In his condition,
it's all for the best.

847
00:55:02,150 --> 00:55:04,902
And just now,
when Karl-Heinz isn't here.

848
00:55:05,069 --> 00:55:07,779
Come. It's better
if you don't stay here.

849
00:55:07,906 --> 00:55:09,823
Has anyone called a doctor?

850
00:55:09,949 --> 00:55:11,575
A doctor can't help him now.

851
00:55:11,743 --> 00:55:13,952
We can only arrange
for a quick burial.

852
00:55:14,078 --> 00:55:16,955
- A coffin will cost a bundle.
- There's always a paper sack.

853
00:55:17,081 --> 00:55:20,417
That's awful.
I don't want to be buried like that.

854
00:55:20,585 --> 00:55:21,835
Don't talk such nonsense.

855
00:55:21,961 --> 00:55:23,921
This doesn't concern you.
Go to your room.

856
00:55:24,088 --> 00:55:26,089
Coffin or no coffin?

857
00:55:26,215 --> 00:55:29,009
The main thing is to get
the body out of here.

858
00:55:29,135 --> 00:55:31,178
Best to put it out on the terrace.

859
00:55:31,304 --> 00:55:33,805
Maybe he had
a contagious disease.

860
00:55:33,932 --> 00:55:36,975
Don't worry. He starved to death.
That's not contagious.

861
00:55:37,101 --> 00:55:41,605
Let's get him outside.

862
00:55:41,773 --> 00:55:45,025
- I'll get his head.
- Good. I've got his legs.

863
00:55:46,778 --> 00:55:49,863
- Mother, lead the way with the light.
- Here we go.

864
00:55:56,579 --> 00:55:59,039
Lucky he's not too heavy.

865
00:56:01,584 --> 00:56:03,627
My poor boy.

866
00:56:07,298 --> 00:56:08,548
Wait.

867
00:56:14,013 --> 00:56:15,347
That should do it.

868
00:56:15,473 --> 00:56:18,433
- What'll happen to his things?
- Good question.

869
00:56:18,559 --> 00:56:21,144
His old torn pajamas
aren't worth anything.

870
00:56:21,270 --> 00:56:23,939
What about the sweater
and woolen socks?

871
00:56:24,065 --> 00:56:25,273
These?

872
00:56:42,000 --> 00:56:44,418
Keep moving.

873
00:56:50,842 --> 00:56:53,468
- I'm back.
- Karl-Heinz!

874
00:56:53,845 --> 00:56:56,013
What is it?
Why are you crying?

875
00:56:56,139 --> 00:56:58,390
- Father's dead.
- Dead?

876
00:57:06,482 --> 00:57:08,316
And all I thought about

877
00:57:08,443 --> 00:57:11,945
was how happy he'd be
to know I was free.

878
00:57:12,238 --> 00:57:15,532
You made his wish come true.
That's the main thing.

879
00:57:15,700 --> 00:57:17,117
Come.

880
00:57:18,327 --> 00:57:20,120
No, this way.

881
00:57:37,055 --> 00:57:39,556
- Poor boy.
- Is he free now?

882
00:57:39,724 --> 00:57:41,641
Yes, completely free.

883
00:57:41,851 --> 00:57:45,145
I took care of everything.
The coffin's been ordered.

884
00:57:46,272 --> 00:57:49,357
It will probably come next week.
It just depends.

885
00:57:49,484 --> 00:57:52,360
- You can't stay here.
- Where can we go?

886
00:57:52,487 --> 00:57:55,238
My place. I have room.
For you too.

887
00:57:55,406 --> 00:57:58,408
- Edmund, pack your things.
- I'm not going with you.

888
00:57:58,576 --> 00:58:00,243
You can't stay here all alone.

889
00:58:00,411 --> 00:58:02,537
There's plenty of room
for me to sleep here.

890
00:58:02,663 --> 00:58:05,582
- Who'll take care of you?
- Let me worry about that.

891
00:58:05,750 --> 00:58:07,793
You forget you're a little boy.

892
00:58:07,919 --> 00:58:11,588
You should have said so earlier, before
I pounded the pavement for all of you.

893
00:58:11,756 --> 00:58:12,923
Edmund!

894
00:58:13,049 --> 00:58:15,258
Leave him alone.
He'll come to his senses.

895
00:59:20,867 --> 00:59:22,492
Damn crater!

896
00:59:22,618 --> 00:59:24,494
I told you to watch your step.

897
00:59:24,662 --> 00:59:26,955
Come on.
I'll show you the way.

898
00:59:28,958 --> 00:59:30,667
Well, good night.

899
00:59:56,944 --> 00:59:58,778
It's awfully close to necrophilia.

900
00:59:58,905 --> 01:00:01,573
You must have been dropped
on your head as a baby!

901
01:00:01,699 --> 01:00:03,867
The buds smell
like a cemetery.

902
01:00:03,993 --> 01:00:05,410
But they're easy to roll.

903
01:00:05,536 --> 01:00:08,788
Man, you just fell
off the turnip truck.

904
01:00:08,915 --> 01:00:10,373
Hash brown potatoes.

905
01:00:11,834 --> 01:00:13,501
Christi!

906
01:00:13,628 --> 01:00:15,086
What is it?

907
01:00:17,882 --> 01:00:19,716
Get outta here!

908
01:00:24,472 --> 01:00:26,473
Looks like you picked up
another trick.

909
01:00:26,599 --> 01:00:29,017
I don't hang around with infants.

910
01:02:32,350 --> 01:02:35,268
Mr. Henning!

911
01:02:41,150 --> 01:02:44,277
- What is it?
- Can I talk to you for a moment?

912
01:02:44,403 --> 01:02:46,071
Of course. Come up.

913
01:02:52,161 --> 01:02:53,536
Come in.

914
01:02:55,498 --> 01:02:57,540
Mr. Henning,
I have to talk to you.

915
01:02:57,708 --> 01:03:00,585
What is it?
You're so pale. What's wrong?

916
01:03:00,795 --> 01:03:03,671
Come sit down.

917
01:03:04,423 --> 01:03:07,133
Now tell me what's wrong.

918
01:03:07,551 --> 01:03:09,844
- I did it.
- Did what?

919
01:03:10,888 --> 01:03:12,680
I killed my father.

920
01:03:12,807 --> 01:03:15,600
- What? You really did?
- You told me to.

921
01:03:15,726 --> 01:03:19,687
Me? I didn't tell you to do
anything, you little monster!

922
01:03:27,571 --> 01:03:31,116
Get up.
How could you do such a thing?

923
01:03:31,242 --> 01:03:34,244
People will find out
you've been coming around here.

924
01:03:34,412 --> 01:03:38,039
I never told you
to do such a thing! Never!

925
01:03:38,165 --> 01:03:40,291
Come on, get up.

926
01:03:40,418 --> 01:03:42,961
Edmund, calm down.

927
01:03:43,254 --> 01:03:45,255
We'll see what we can do.

928
01:03:45,381 --> 01:03:47,757
I really am fond of you,
my boy.

929
01:04:28,132 --> 01:04:30,800
- Can I play with you?
- No, we're playing by ourselves.

930
01:04:30,968 --> 01:04:33,887
- I can show you how to play.
- No.

931
01:04:39,560 --> 01:04:41,102
Come on.

932
01:09:27,431 --> 01:09:29,432
Mr. Rademacher!

933
01:09:30,267 --> 01:09:32,727
Someone should tell the children.

934
01:10:24,029 --> 01:10:26,405
- Where's Edmund?
- I haven't seen him.

935
01:10:26,573 --> 01:10:28,574
Have you seen Edmund?

936
01:10:29,827 --> 01:10:31,702
We'll find him.

937
01:12:23,690 --> 01:12:25,107
My God!
