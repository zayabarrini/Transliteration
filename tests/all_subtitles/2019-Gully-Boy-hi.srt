1
00:03:12,790 --> 00:03:13,930
Yo, Homie.

2
00:03:20,890 --> 00:03:22,100
Where to, bro?

3
00:03:22,550 --> 00:03:23,650
To pick up a car.

4
00:03:23,980 --> 00:03:26,730
I thought I'd take you losers
for a spin today.

5
00:03:27,280 --> 00:03:28,390
Can I drive?

6
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:31,540
Hang back and keep your eyes open.

7
00:03:31,990 --> 00:03:32,990
Why?

8
00:03:33,280 --> 00:03:34,970
Just whistle if you see anyone.

9
00:03:38,960 --> 00:03:40,550
He's going Grand Theft Auto, bro.

10
00:03:41,500 --> 00:03:42,560
Moeen?

11
00:03:48,780 --> 00:03:50,500
What are you doing, man?

12
00:04:02,430 --> 00:04:04,050
What's this bullshit?

13
00:04:04,860 --> 00:04:05,970
I'm picking up a car.

14
00:04:07,090 --> 00:04:08,090
Get in!

15
00:04:12,330 --> 00:04:14,760
Want a selfie or what? Let's go!

16
00:04:19,800 --> 00:04:21,290
Nice, it's automatic.

17
00:04:33,200 --> 00:04:35,950
This shady shit doesn't fly.
You should've told me before.

18
00:04:36,080 --> 00:04:37,300
As if you would've come!

19
00:04:37,700 --> 00:04:39,880
Put it off!
It's messing with my head.

20
00:04:40,010 --> 00:04:41,430
Why won't it switch off?

21
00:04:45,170 --> 00:04:46,950
Homie, I thought you liked rap music.

22
00:04:47,080 --> 00:04:48,320
You call this rap?

23
00:04:49,370 --> 00:04:51,840
Remixed old shit to make
the public dance?

24
00:04:53,410 --> 00:04:56,430
Check out my ride
My shoes, my rags.

25
00:04:56,560 --> 00:04:58,160
My liquor, my chicks!

26
00:04:58,290 --> 00:04:59,740
Wannabes!

27
00:04:59,870 --> 00:05:03,400
Good thing we jacked his car.

28
00:05:04,350 --> 00:05:05,490
Happy now?

29
00:05:10,180 --> 00:05:11,600
Having fun?

30
00:05:35,490 --> 00:05:37,050
Grandma, move your leg.

31
00:05:37,180 --> 00:05:39,000
- Why?
- Father wants the bag.

32
00:05:39,130 --> 00:05:41,110
Shakir, must you move
everything around?

33
00:05:41,240 --> 00:05:44,240
- Only the TV.
- How am I going to watch it then?

34
00:05:44,480 --> 00:05:47,280
- I'll buy you another.
- After I die?

35
00:05:47,410 --> 00:05:50,560
- Spare me today.
- Did you spare your wife and kids?

36
00:05:52,590 --> 00:05:54,900
Move it a bit further.

37
00:06:01,500 --> 00:06:05,470
He's taking the TV inside, too.
She's put a spell on him.

38
00:06:08,440 --> 00:06:10,020
Where do I put my things?

39
00:06:18,660 --> 00:06:20,540
What's all this drama?
Pick them up!

40
00:06:25,610 --> 00:06:26,960
Move it further.

41
00:06:31,270 --> 00:06:32,320
Ma?

42
00:06:42,400 --> 00:06:45,220
Wait up, man.
I've got something for you.

43
00:06:50,020 --> 00:06:52,380
For you, Homie. A thank-you gift.

44
00:06:52,810 --> 00:06:55,180
I don't want your shady shit.

45
00:06:57,260 --> 00:06:58,730
Take it, man.

46
00:06:59,540 --> 00:07:03,070
Smooth as butter. It's sexy.

47
00:07:03,200 --> 00:07:06,310
Forget it.
I'm not interested in your junk.

48
00:07:07,280 --> 00:07:08,510
Here, catch!

49
00:07:11,650 --> 00:07:13,530
Interested in my stash?

50
00:07:40,050 --> 00:07:43,340
Remember to pick up
Uncle Abbas's letter today.

51
00:08:22,370 --> 00:08:23,430
Please sit.

52
00:08:51,470 --> 00:08:54,290
Statement of sale account
prepared by the exporter.

53
00:08:54,580 --> 00:08:55,890
Whereas the consular invoice

54
00:08:56,020 --> 00:09:00,150
is a certificate issued by the
consulate of importer's country.

55
00:09:00,280 --> 00:09:03,050
Whereas consular invoice is a document

56
00:09:03,470 --> 00:09:05,390
which is not required
by the importer's country.

57
00:09:05,520 --> 00:09:07,950
Very few countries insist on the document.

58
00:09:08,990 --> 00:09:11,260
I'll be there in 30-35 minutes, man.

59
00:09:11,390 --> 00:09:12,770
30-35 minutes?

60
00:09:12,900 --> 00:09:13,900
You nuts?

61
00:09:13,930 --> 00:09:15,690
I'll catch the 381 limited bus.

62
00:09:15,820 --> 00:09:17,520
It will take you an hour.

63
00:09:17,650 --> 00:09:19,940
It's a 90-minute round trip.

64
00:09:20,070 --> 00:09:24,110
- But you owe us a party.
- Only two days into my job...

65
00:09:24,240 --> 00:09:27,310
Don't be cheap.
Never forget your brothers.

66
00:09:27,440 --> 00:09:29,900
What will you do with all that money?

67
00:09:30,030 --> 00:09:31,790
Ladies and gentlemen!

68
00:09:32,600 --> 00:09:35,320
Meet the assistant manager
of Benetton's Chembur branch.

69
00:09:35,450 --> 00:09:36,450
What say, public?

70
00:09:36,490 --> 00:09:40,820
- Ladyboy, drop it.
- Who would've thought our Rishi Sadrani

71
00:09:40,950 --> 00:09:42,970
would storm the fashion industry?

72
00:09:43,100 --> 00:09:45,400
You're the one and only.
You're killing it!

73
00:09:45,530 --> 00:09:48,700
Go on, then. Take the piss.

74
00:09:48,830 --> 00:09:50,850
Stop your reality TV.

75
00:09:52,850 --> 00:09:53,670
Yeah?

76
00:09:53,800 --> 00:09:56,200
I look like a gangster in the video.

77
00:09:57,270 --> 00:09:58,580
Show me again.

78
00:09:58,890 --> 00:10:00,020
I'm coming.

79
00:10:09,410 --> 00:10:11,310
This is a great video, man.

80
00:10:12,580 --> 00:10:15,060
Hey, where to?
At least say goodbye.

81
00:10:15,190 --> 00:10:16,590
Give us a flying kiss.

82
00:13:07,360 --> 00:13:10,410
Why is every eye moist
in this shantytown?

83
00:13:12,130 --> 00:13:15,590
Days turn to poison
once the sun goes down.

84
00:13:17,660 --> 00:13:22,100
Restless and troubled
are those who live here.

85
00:13:24,090 --> 00:13:27,530
In this bottomless well
where they'll drown.

86
00:13:31,000 --> 00:13:33,300
Those are bulls.
You can take pictures.

87
00:13:33,430 --> 00:13:34,710
Move along, kid.

88
00:13:35,780 --> 00:13:37,000
And this is the toilet.

89
00:13:37,580 --> 00:13:39,140
This is for the whole community.

90
00:13:39,430 --> 00:13:40,876
How many people are in the community?

91
00:13:40,900 --> 00:13:41,770
Lots!

92
00:13:41,900 --> 00:13:45,030
The other one is being built over there.
Come, I'll show you.

93
00:13:45,160 --> 00:13:47,500
Please come. This side.

94
00:13:51,170 --> 00:13:53,260
Aunty, these people are from London.

95
00:13:53,920 --> 00:13:54,920
Five hundred rupees.

96
00:13:54,990 --> 00:13:59,440
They've already bought tickets.
It will pay for the new toilet.

97
00:13:59,570 --> 00:14:03,000
Then show them the toilet!
Five hundred to see my house.

98
00:14:04,920 --> 00:14:05,920
Please come.

99
00:14:07,390 --> 00:14:08,900
Oh, wow!

100
00:14:10,510 --> 00:14:11,580
Wow!

101
00:14:14,600 --> 00:14:15,740
Namaste!

102
00:14:16,690 --> 00:14:17,810
Namaste!

103
00:14:21,590 --> 00:14:23,700
- Oh, it's amazing!
- Crazy, isn't it?

104
00:14:25,410 --> 00:14:28,650
Every inch is being used.
It's incredible.

105
00:14:28,780 --> 00:14:31,530
- How many people live here?
- I have no idea.

106
00:14:34,260 --> 00:14:35,750
So small!

107
00:14:41,050 --> 00:14:42,140
Nice T-shirt.

108
00:14:43,020 --> 00:14:46,220
Oh, thanks. It's Nas.
He's a rapper.

109
00:14:46,350 --> 00:14:48,520
He's one of the biggest
American rappers of all-time.

110
00:14:48,650 --> 00:14:51,190
Rappers, I monkey flip 'em
With the funky rhythm

111
00:14:51,320 --> 00:14:53,690
I be kickin' musician
Inflictin' composition of pain

112
00:14:53,820 --> 00:14:55,360
I'm like Scarface, sniffin' cocaine.

113
00:14:55,490 --> 00:14:58,230
Holding an M-16
See with the pen I'm extreme, now.

114
00:14:58,360 --> 00:15:01,190
Bullet holes left in my peepholes
I'm suited up in street clothes.

115
00:15:01,320 --> 00:15:03,620
Hand me a nine and I'll defeat foes.

116
00:15:06,680 --> 00:15:09,090
You know it. That's awesome!
Can I take your picture?

117
00:15:10,870 --> 00:15:12,520
Cool. Lovely meeting you!

118
00:15:16,780 --> 00:15:17,810
Salaam.

119
00:15:21,320 --> 00:15:22,840
Ma, we're off to work.

120
00:15:25,980 --> 00:15:27,040
What's this?

121
00:15:27,920 --> 00:15:29,010
Put on some clothes!

122
00:15:36,840 --> 00:15:39,590
So now must we wash
the Queen's dishes too?

123
00:15:58,440 --> 00:16:00,620
- Open wide.
- Father.

124
00:16:01,180 --> 00:16:04,830
Mrs. Thakur has ordered some painkillers.
I'll drop them off.

125
00:16:13,680 --> 00:16:14,680
What's up?

126
00:16:22,940 --> 00:16:24,250
How's your new mom?

127
00:16:24,540 --> 00:16:26,960
Like an uninvited guest.

128
00:16:33,460 --> 00:16:34,460
Hey!

129
00:16:35,150 --> 00:16:36,150
Want to get me killed?

130
00:16:36,280 --> 00:16:38,680
Why? You won't die for me?

131
00:16:52,490 --> 00:16:53,500
Salaam.

132
00:17:10,260 --> 00:17:11,580
Ma is very unhappy.

133
00:17:11,950 --> 00:17:13,390
There's nothing I can do.

134
00:17:13,990 --> 00:17:15,440
She's your sister.

135
00:17:17,900 --> 00:17:19,230
And he's her husband.

136
00:17:27,890 --> 00:17:29,410
Safeena, why are you walking so fast?

137
00:17:29,540 --> 00:17:30,990
I'm getting late, Ma.

138
00:17:31,120 --> 00:17:32,360
When will you be back?

139
00:17:32,490 --> 00:17:34,160
- I'm not coming.
- What?

140
00:17:34,290 --> 00:17:35,610
What did you say?

141
00:17:35,740 --> 00:17:37,650
Ma, I'm in medical school.

142
00:17:37,780 --> 00:17:41,410
I can't keep skipping lectures
to attend wretched weddings.

143
00:17:41,920 --> 00:17:43,990
You want a slap right now?

144
00:17:44,410 --> 00:17:46,710
How dare you call your
cousin's wedding "wretched"?

145
00:17:47,060 --> 00:17:49,760
Skipping one class
will not cause a calamity.

146
00:17:50,130 --> 00:17:51,910
Be home by one o'clock. Got it?

147
00:17:59,610 --> 00:18:01,450
She's here. So is her mom.

148
00:18:02,870 --> 00:18:04,400
- Hello, Aunty.
- How are you, Suhani?

149
00:18:04,530 --> 00:18:05,690
- Good.
- Let's go.

150
00:18:10,710 --> 00:18:13,250
- Look! I've got a secret admirer.
- Who?

151
00:18:17,910 --> 00:18:19,270
You replied?

152
00:18:19,660 --> 00:18:21,500
Just to find out who it is.

153
00:18:23,720 --> 00:18:24,910
Truecall this.

154
00:18:25,690 --> 00:18:27,750
- What?
- Check whose number it is.

155
00:18:30,580 --> 00:18:32,970
- You're in some mood.
- Why did you reply?

156
00:18:35,110 --> 00:18:36,120
Tell me.

157
00:18:36,700 --> 00:18:39,190
- Albina Dadarkar.
- Our Albina?

158
00:18:39,320 --> 00:18:41,150
What do you mean "our"?

159
00:18:48,190 --> 00:18:49,760
Hey, Safeena!

160
00:18:53,700 --> 00:18:55,690
- Where are you going?
- Where are you going?

161
00:18:55,820 --> 00:18:57,480
- Have you lost it?
- Safeena!

162
00:18:57,840 --> 00:19:00,250
Albina, where are you?

163
00:19:09,720 --> 00:19:10,800
Albina.

164
00:19:12,850 --> 00:19:14,010
Albina!

165
00:19:22,150 --> 00:19:26,030
You know Murad and I have been together
since we were 13, right?

166
00:19:26,360 --> 00:19:27,180
So?

167
00:19:27,310 --> 00:19:28,310
So!

168
00:19:29,540 --> 00:19:32,150
Why are you texting him,
you witch?

169
00:19:33,930 --> 00:19:37,890
- We've been together for nine years.
- That doesn't mean there'll be a tenth.

170
00:19:38,020 --> 00:19:40,840
- Somebody, stop them!
- What did you say?

171
00:19:41,880 --> 00:19:43,640
Say it again. Go on!

172
00:19:43,770 --> 00:19:46,360
- Get off me, bitch.
- If I'm a bitch, what are you?

173
00:19:48,110 --> 00:19:49,230
You witch!

174
00:19:50,840 --> 00:19:52,530
Hurry up! Call Madam.

175
00:19:55,990 --> 00:19:58,770
Stay away from him. You hear me?

176
00:19:58,900 --> 00:20:00,670
Stay away from him!

177
00:20:01,210 --> 00:20:03,770
- Don't look at him again.
- Die, bitch!

178
00:20:03,900 --> 00:20:06,250
Or I'll pull your eyes out!

179
00:20:17,500 --> 00:20:19,750
The scratches aren't permanent,
are they?

180
00:20:21,180 --> 00:20:23,110
Albina says you hit her first.

181
00:20:23,380 --> 00:20:24,520
She's lying, father.

182
00:20:24,750 --> 00:20:25,860
Who is Murad?

183
00:20:30,360 --> 00:20:32,610
You know him. My schoolmate.

184
00:20:32,740 --> 00:20:33,750
Who?

185
00:20:34,180 --> 00:20:35,750
- Razia's son?
- Yes.

186
00:20:36,490 --> 00:20:37,990
She used to cater for your father.

187
00:20:39,340 --> 00:20:41,880
Albina sends Murad
Valentine messages.

188
00:20:42,010 --> 00:20:43,010
What?

189
00:20:43,270 --> 00:20:44,270
Yes.

190
00:20:44,370 --> 00:20:46,800
So Murad asked me to tell her
to stop sending them.

191
00:20:46,930 --> 00:20:48,110
She's lying, Father.

192
00:20:48,240 --> 00:20:49,950
You can check her phone, Uncle.

193
00:20:51,650 --> 00:20:53,620
- How can you check...
- Shut up!

194
00:20:55,390 --> 00:20:58,230
When I told her to stop sending them,
she swore at me.

195
00:20:58,660 --> 00:21:01,330
- Then I hit her once.
- You're such a liar.

196
00:21:01,620 --> 00:21:02,830
What's all this then?

197
00:21:04,080 --> 00:21:05,900
It's nothing serious, Father.

198
00:21:06,680 --> 00:21:08,180
I swear it.

199
00:21:08,310 --> 00:21:10,790
She and Murad have been dating
since school.

200
00:21:11,470 --> 00:21:14,580
Oh! What utter rubbish.

201
00:21:14,710 --> 00:21:15,520
Check my phone.

202
00:21:15,650 --> 00:21:17,760
Please check my phone!

203
00:21:19,750 --> 00:21:21,680
I'm sorry about this.

204
00:21:22,990 --> 00:21:23,990
Let's go.

205
00:21:31,080 --> 00:21:32,300
What's going on?

206
00:21:33,230 --> 00:21:34,580
What do you mean?

207
00:21:36,270 --> 00:21:40,440
Wouldn't you know if I was having
an affair right under your nose?

208
00:21:40,570 --> 00:21:43,390
Enough. Safeena, go home.

209
00:21:43,980 --> 00:21:46,100
I really wanted to come to the wedding.

210
00:21:50,100 --> 00:21:52,480
Whatever. Why did you hit her?

211
00:21:52,610 --> 00:21:55,300
If she coochie-coos my boyfriend,
sure I'll whack her.

212
00:21:55,430 --> 00:21:57,010
Oh, you're a big thug now?

213
00:21:57,140 --> 00:22:00,650
- I don't want your lectures.
- But you want to be a hooligan?

214
00:22:00,780 --> 00:22:03,080
Be thankful I didn't snap her neck.

215
00:22:03,210 --> 00:22:07,560
I've one life, only one you.
She's elbowing in. Won't I get mad?

216
00:22:14,140 --> 00:22:17,120
I'll have to get you exorcised.
You're possessed.

217
00:22:18,340 --> 00:22:20,580
OK, sorry.
It won't happen again.

218
00:22:20,710 --> 00:22:22,470
Swear on me then.

219
00:22:23,620 --> 00:22:24,640
You'll die.

220
00:22:27,930 --> 00:22:29,070
Listen.

221
00:22:31,140 --> 00:22:35,310
- We should call you Danger Lady from now.
- Am I so dangerous?

222
00:22:38,880 --> 00:22:41,000
- Your college has no festivals?
- No.

223
00:22:41,130 --> 00:22:43,180
Med students are too busy.

224
00:22:46,820 --> 00:22:48,620
- Come on.
- Check that out!

225
00:22:48,750 --> 00:22:51,850
Why are you so quiet?
Give laughter a chance.

226
00:22:51,980 --> 00:22:55,430
Without reason.

227
00:22:57,530 --> 00:22:59,430
Stop this lullaby!

228
00:22:59,560 --> 00:23:01,960
Spare us this nonsense, Madam!

229
00:23:04,570 --> 00:23:08,100
Let's savor the moment.

230
00:23:08,730 --> 00:23:11,770
For you're not alone.

231
00:23:13,370 --> 00:23:15,750
Get this girl out of here!

232
00:23:26,710 --> 00:23:27,870
What happened?

233
00:23:28,000 --> 00:23:30,380
Those guys were saying something
over there.

234
00:23:33,810 --> 00:23:35,480
What's going on, guys?

235
00:23:36,770 --> 00:23:38,430
Couldn't handle Juhi's talent?

236
00:23:38,640 --> 00:23:39,870
Who's he?

237
00:23:41,270 --> 00:23:42,850
Who found the song boring?

238
00:23:43,670 --> 00:23:44,860
The girl was boring!

239
00:23:49,200 --> 00:23:50,330
There you are.

240
00:23:50,850 --> 00:23:54,060
And if you don't like her,
she should shut up, right?

241
00:23:56,560 --> 00:23:57,810
Well said!

242
00:23:58,550 --> 00:24:00,100
Don't get started now.

243
00:24:00,440 --> 00:24:03,820
Come, I'll perform for you.
Tell me what you think.

244
00:24:06,670 --> 00:24:08,300
What say, JD?

245
00:24:09,760 --> 00:24:13,940
Let's play something.
Some old school hip-hop banger!

246
00:24:14,500 --> 00:24:16,670
Old school banger!

247
00:24:17,340 --> 00:24:20,190
These guys will dance with Sher now!

248
00:24:31,950 --> 00:24:34,110
A lion roars his own story.

249
00:24:34,240 --> 00:24:36,620
This rap will end your delusion.

250
00:24:36,750 --> 00:24:38,700
Chicks and cars
Don't make me feel big.

251
00:24:38,830 --> 00:24:41,080
Truth sets my soul on fire.

252
00:24:41,210 --> 00:24:43,540
You're not like me 'coz you're a fake.

253
00:24:43,670 --> 00:24:46,920
A snake for women
A blot on mankind.

254
00:24:47,050 --> 00:24:50,520
My words have more heat than you
Shame on you!

255
00:24:50,650 --> 00:24:52,790
You have no future.

256
00:24:52,920 --> 00:24:55,900
You have no strength.

257
00:24:56,180 --> 00:24:59,810
Use your head, this is my rule
My word is law!

258
00:24:59,940 --> 00:25:04,170
Run for your life
This lion is on the prowl.

259
00:25:04,400 --> 00:25:06,540
- Run for your life...
- This lion is on the prowl.

260
00:25:06,670 --> 00:25:08,960
The wave of truth has flooded the town.

261
00:25:09,090 --> 00:25:11,290
Stop throwing your weight around
Watch your step.

262
00:25:11,420 --> 00:25:13,500
Be true to yourself.

263
00:25:13,630 --> 00:25:15,870
Kill your arrogance.

264
00:25:16,000 --> 00:25:18,330
End this empty existence.

265
00:25:18,460 --> 00:25:20,540
End this hustling.

266
00:25:20,670 --> 00:25:22,920
And random muscling.

267
00:25:23,050 --> 00:25:25,120
Cool that fever.

268
00:25:25,250 --> 00:25:27,490
End this bragging.

269
00:25:27,620 --> 00:25:29,830
End this hustling.

270
00:25:29,960 --> 00:25:32,260
And random muscling.

271
00:25:32,390 --> 00:25:34,370
Cool that fever.

272
00:25:34,500 --> 00:25:36,440
End this bragging.

273
00:25:36,570 --> 00:25:38,940
Run for your life
This lion is on the prowl.

274
00:25:39,070 --> 00:25:41,240
Run for your life
This lion is on the prowl.

275
00:25:41,370 --> 00:25:43,480
Run for your life
This lion is on the prowl.

276
00:25:43,610 --> 00:25:45,920
The wave of truth has flooded the town.

277
00:25:46,050 --> 00:25:48,160
Run for your life
This lion is on the prowl.

278
00:25:48,290 --> 00:25:50,500
Run for your life
This lion is on the prowl.

279
00:25:50,630 --> 00:25:52,700
Run for your life
This lion is on the prowl.

280
00:25:52,830 --> 00:25:55,180
The wave of truth has flooded the town.

281
00:26:09,200 --> 00:26:12,790
So, I have to cut out rice and roti
to build my body?

282
00:26:12,920 --> 00:26:15,530
Who told you that, nutcase?

283
00:26:16,070 --> 00:26:17,390
You'll look like a cucumber!

284
00:26:17,730 --> 00:26:20,020
Eat roti. And meat too.

285
00:26:25,050 --> 00:26:26,180
Where to, man?

286
00:26:34,270 --> 00:26:35,400
Check him out.

287
00:26:36,060 --> 00:26:37,850
A third business for him?

288
00:26:38,650 --> 00:26:40,520
Business is good, man.

289
00:26:40,650 --> 00:26:43,660
Next he'll be in a suit and tie
in an air-conditioned office.

290
00:26:50,280 --> 00:26:51,360
Yes, Ma.

291
00:26:52,610 --> 00:26:53,620
What?

292
00:26:54,820 --> 00:26:57,370
And please, remember RICE.

293
00:26:57,500 --> 00:27:00,760
Rest. Ice. Compression. Elevation.

294
00:27:02,850 --> 00:27:05,670
I've paid the bill.
Keep these papers safe.

295
00:27:05,800 --> 00:27:09,370
Doctor... when can I go back to work?

296
00:27:09,500 --> 00:27:12,870
We'll decide after six weeks
of rest and physio.

297
00:27:16,280 --> 00:27:18,370
I'll inform Madam.

298
00:27:20,750 --> 00:27:24,230
Sir, let my son take my place till then.

299
00:27:24,360 --> 00:27:25,510
Can he drive?

300
00:27:25,830 --> 00:27:28,620
Yes, he's an excellent driver.

301
00:27:29,370 --> 00:27:33,160
Madam will need a temporary driver.

302
00:27:33,290 --> 00:27:34,290
OK.

303
00:27:34,790 --> 00:27:37,940
- I'll ask her.
- Thank you.

304
00:27:40,480 --> 00:27:42,520
How can you make him
do this menial job?

305
00:27:42,650 --> 00:27:45,370
Menial? Is your son some prince?

306
00:27:45,500 --> 00:27:47,330
You said he'd do an office job.

307
00:27:47,460 --> 00:27:49,220
Yes. So what?

308
00:27:49,480 --> 00:27:51,770
Drivers are a dime a dozen.

309
00:27:52,070 --> 00:27:54,230
What if Madam gets a temp
she likes better?

310
00:27:54,360 --> 00:27:56,660
Jobs like this don't grow on trees.

311
00:27:57,170 --> 00:27:58,510
They're good people.

312
00:27:58,870 --> 00:28:01,530
It's tough enough for Muslims
these days.

313
00:28:01,820 --> 00:28:04,250
He has to study.
What if he fails his exams?

314
00:28:04,380 --> 00:28:05,510
He won't.

315
00:28:05,950 --> 00:28:08,290
I've put a lot of money
into his education.

316
00:28:08,870 --> 00:28:10,990
He knows he has to pay me back.

317
00:28:11,500 --> 00:28:14,590
I have big dreams for him.

318
00:28:14,970 --> 00:28:18,450
Dreams? Who do you think you are?

319
00:28:18,730 --> 00:28:23,040
Look around. Make sure your
big dreams match your reality.

320
00:28:29,020 --> 00:28:30,860
- I'm leaving, Ma.
- Murad.

321
00:28:34,510 --> 00:28:36,040
Drive carefully.

322
00:28:36,380 --> 00:28:38,970
Don't talk to Madam too much.
Keep to yourself.

323
00:28:39,690 --> 00:28:41,860
Open and shut the door for her.

324
00:28:42,550 --> 00:28:44,260
Don't act smart.

325
00:28:45,200 --> 00:28:46,200
Got it?

326
00:28:48,630 --> 00:28:51,300
Your second mother will go with you.

327
00:29:16,490 --> 00:29:20,250
Wait at the car parking lot.
Come inside when you are called for.

328
00:29:20,680 --> 00:29:22,290
Keep a note of your overtime.

329
00:30:07,210 --> 00:30:09,840
Someone's going on night duty, man.

330
00:30:10,230 --> 00:30:11,890
Dressed like a gentleman!

331
00:30:12,640 --> 00:30:15,300
- I'll miss you tonight, Homie.
- Only you care, bro.

332
00:30:15,640 --> 00:30:19,310
I'm taking my new Mercedes
out of the garage tonight.

333
00:30:19,620 --> 00:30:23,680
Cruisin' with my Barbie doll.
While you and your madam

334
00:30:24,020 --> 00:30:26,800
will pass us on the Sea Link
in slow motion.

335
00:30:26,930 --> 00:30:28,170
It will be a hoot!

336
00:30:28,780 --> 00:30:31,420
The only doll you're ever gonna have
is him.

337
00:30:33,380 --> 00:30:34,670
I'm no doll.

338
00:30:35,080 --> 00:30:37,250
Sure, you are. Even prettier than me.

339
00:30:37,380 --> 00:30:40,080
Stop fishing.
You know you're hot.

340
00:30:42,400 --> 00:30:44,050
You think I'm hot?

341
00:30:52,180 --> 00:30:54,040
Why are you laughing, Benetton?

342
00:30:54,170 --> 00:30:57,780
She's taking the piss
and you're letting her.

343
00:30:58,320 --> 00:30:59,470
Keep smoking.

344
00:30:59,800 --> 00:31:02,260
Call me when your lungs are toast.

345
00:31:03,080 --> 00:31:04,750
Let's go, doctor,

346
00:31:04,880 --> 00:31:07,170
before your mother comes

347
00:31:07,300 --> 00:31:09,390
and stabs me. Bye.

348
00:31:35,910 --> 00:31:37,490
You'll be up all night?

349
00:31:39,510 --> 00:31:40,910
Watch a movie or something.

350
00:31:41,370 --> 00:31:42,920
I'm out of mobile data.

351
00:31:56,700 --> 00:31:57,990
I'll return it tomorrow.

352
00:31:59,120 --> 00:32:00,960
- It's yours.
- Are you crazy?

353
00:32:01,290 --> 00:32:02,290
Why?

354
00:32:03,950 --> 00:32:05,610
Don't you accept secondhand gifts?

355
00:32:07,250 --> 00:32:09,310
I can never give you anything
this costly.

356
00:32:15,690 --> 00:32:16,780
You...

357
00:32:17,490 --> 00:32:18,570
let...

358
00:32:20,630 --> 00:32:21,630
me...

359
00:32:24,000 --> 00:32:25,320
be myself.

360
00:32:28,180 --> 00:32:30,510
You're all I want in this world.

361
00:32:45,700 --> 00:32:46,700
Safeena!

362
00:32:47,570 --> 00:32:50,120
- Where were you?
- At Suhani's.

363
00:32:50,250 --> 00:32:51,540
It's late, Safeena.

364
00:32:51,670 --> 00:32:52,790
I know, Ma.

365
00:32:52,920 --> 00:32:55,500
I left my iPad in the rickshaw,
so I had to run back.

366
00:32:55,630 --> 00:32:56,460
Found it?

367
00:32:56,590 --> 00:32:59,940
No. I've looked everywhere.
Asked all the rickshaw drivers but...

368
00:33:00,070 --> 00:33:03,940
You think the driver would say:
"Here, madam, your iPad."

369
00:33:04,070 --> 00:33:05,290
It's gone now.

370
00:33:06,260 --> 00:33:07,330
OK, forget it.

371
00:33:07,460 --> 00:33:08,600
But, Father...

372
00:33:09,610 --> 00:33:11,570
my whole project was on it.

373
00:33:12,460 --> 00:33:13,530
Sorry.

374
00:33:14,150 --> 00:33:15,280
I'll buy you a new one.

375
00:33:16,650 --> 00:33:20,220
Great! "Sorry" fixes everything.
Finish your homework!

376
00:33:24,620 --> 00:33:26,200
This is Harvard, Nikki.

377
00:33:26,330 --> 00:33:27,976
Do you even know how tough
it is to get in?

378
00:33:28,000 --> 00:33:29,520
It is my decision.

379
00:33:29,650 --> 00:33:32,080
I don't want to study right now.
I want to work.

380
00:33:32,210 --> 00:33:35,040
We don't have to discuss
this tonight, please.

381
00:33:35,400 --> 00:33:38,870
What kind of a job are you going to get
without a proper qualification?

382
00:33:39,550 --> 00:33:42,940
I'm a graduate.
That is a proper qualification.

383
00:33:44,020 --> 00:33:45,480
- You?
- Yes, sir.

384
00:33:45,750 --> 00:33:46,890
How educated are you?

385
00:33:47,420 --> 00:33:49,370
I'm in my final year of graduation, sir.

386
00:33:50,360 --> 00:33:51,510
Did you hear that?

387
00:33:52,040 --> 00:33:53,680
Everyone's a graduate today.

388
00:33:53,810 --> 00:33:56,080
And you want to be on the same level
as he is?

389
00:34:27,530 --> 00:34:30,200
Six! Five! Four!

390
00:34:30,490 --> 00:34:33,400
Three! Two! One!

391
00:34:33,530 --> 00:34:35,800
Happy New Year!

392
00:34:45,930 --> 00:34:47,440
My time will come.

393
00:34:56,180 --> 00:34:59,460
My time will come.

394
00:35:03,190 --> 00:35:05,180
The lava of my words.

395
00:35:07,480 --> 00:35:09,260
Will melt my shackles.

396
00:35:09,390 --> 00:35:10,930
My time will come.

397
00:35:21,910 --> 00:35:23,510
"My time will come."

398
00:35:29,820 --> 00:35:31,670
Were they drinking till morning?

399
00:35:33,110 --> 00:35:35,040
Their daughter too?

400
00:35:36,410 --> 00:35:38,110
Now they'll sleep all day?

401
00:35:39,590 --> 00:35:40,590
Yes, Grandma.

402
00:35:41,030 --> 00:35:43,340
This only happens in hell.

403
00:35:44,980 --> 00:35:47,030
Get your head out of that.

404
00:35:47,400 --> 00:35:48,920
Or your neck will get stuck.

405
00:35:50,130 --> 00:35:51,510
What's up, public?

406
00:35:51,790 --> 00:35:56,100
Any of you written anything?
Something to say? Want to sing along?

407
00:35:56,230 --> 00:35:59,970
Come at the venue mentioned below.
We're jamming there today.

408
00:36:00,240 --> 00:36:03,510
We're meeting at 4:20. See you!

409
00:36:06,950 --> 00:36:09,000
Grab them, rip them
Cut them, flog them

410
00:36:09,130 --> 00:36:11,140
I wanna see deep welts on their skin.

411
00:36:11,270 --> 00:36:13,950
Slowly they will confess.

412
00:36:15,700 --> 00:36:17,750
Sink the ground beneath their feet.

413
00:36:17,880 --> 00:36:19,830
It's 2018
The nation is in danger.

414
00:36:19,960 --> 00:36:22,120
Engulfed in flames.

415
00:36:22,250 --> 00:36:24,120
Shout them down, scare them all.

416
00:36:24,250 --> 00:36:26,300
Play your poisonous flute
Enchant them all.

417
00:36:26,430 --> 00:36:28,710
Make them surrender.

418
00:36:28,840 --> 00:36:30,800
Or bleed them dry.

419
00:36:30,930 --> 00:36:34,370
Long live Jingostaan!

420
00:36:35,260 --> 00:36:36,260
Jingostaan!

421
00:36:39,600 --> 00:36:40,810
Jingostaan!

422
00:36:43,970 --> 00:36:46,000
Grab them, rip them
Cut them, flog them

423
00:36:46,130 --> 00:36:48,180
I wanna see deep welts on their skin.

424
00:36:52,670 --> 00:36:55,370
Slowly they will confess.

425
00:36:59,180 --> 00:37:01,360
It's 2018
The nation is in danger.

426
00:37:01,490 --> 00:37:02,650
Jingostaan!

427
00:37:06,710 --> 00:37:07,710
Hi!

428
00:37:08,430 --> 00:37:09,240
Hi.

429
00:37:09,370 --> 00:37:13,760
I saw you perform at SM College.
You really showed those guys.

430
00:37:14,030 --> 00:37:16,150
- You're a hard performer, bro.
- Thanks, man.

431
00:37:17,480 --> 00:37:20,010
I found you on Facebook.
I wanted to meet you.

432
00:37:20,140 --> 00:37:21,150
Here I am.

433
00:37:21,280 --> 00:37:24,800
My name is Murad.
I've written something.

434
00:37:27,160 --> 00:37:29,970
Use it in your rap, if you like it.

435
00:37:32,590 --> 00:37:34,110
I write my own stories, man.

436
00:37:35,870 --> 00:37:37,300
Tell your stories yourself.

437
00:37:37,670 --> 00:37:42,030
I don't perform, man. I just write.
I wanted you to have it.

438
00:37:42,400 --> 00:37:44,740
If you won't express your own thoughts,
why should I?

439
00:37:47,410 --> 00:37:50,630
Long live Jingostaan!

440
00:37:51,100 --> 00:37:53,200
- What's your name again?
- Murad.

441
00:37:54,000 --> 00:37:55,000
Murad.

442
00:37:55,320 --> 00:37:57,280
Your words came
straight out of your heart, right?

443
00:37:58,610 --> 00:38:00,050
Then why are you scared?

444
00:38:00,350 --> 00:38:03,300
Let it out.
It's open mic. Shout it loud!

445
00:38:03,710 --> 00:38:06,830
For the first time on the open mic,
it's Murad!

446
00:38:06,960 --> 00:38:10,100
Not in front of so many people.
I'm not comfortable, man.

447
00:38:10,700 --> 00:38:13,400
If everyone in the world was comfortable,
who'd make rap?

448
00:38:15,050 --> 00:38:16,700
Chintoo, give him a beat.

449
00:38:19,960 --> 00:38:22,500
Come on, go now.

450
00:38:51,510 --> 00:38:53,350
Come on, let out the words.

451
00:38:58,710 --> 00:39:01,500
Rise like a phoenix from the ashes!

452
00:39:01,630 --> 00:39:04,290
As your wings spread
The sky will bow to you.

453
00:39:04,420 --> 00:39:06,530
My time will come.

454
00:39:06,660 --> 00:39:09,600
None is as smooth a hustler as me.

455
00:39:13,890 --> 00:39:14,890
Hard, bro!

456
00:39:16,070 --> 00:39:19,380
The lava of my words will melt my shackles.

457
00:39:19,510 --> 00:39:22,340
Reap as you shall sow.

458
00:39:22,470 --> 00:39:25,590
My dreams will make fear tremble.

459
00:39:25,720 --> 00:39:28,690
You can't bury dreams six-feet-under.

460
00:39:38,010 --> 00:39:40,840
No fear, only guts!

461
00:39:40,970 --> 00:39:44,100
We'll storm ahead, we'll seize the day.

462
00:39:44,230 --> 00:39:47,500
Blood and sweat gave our life meaning.

463
00:39:47,630 --> 00:39:49,060
This line is real hard.

464
00:39:51,970 --> 00:39:52,980
Damn, I'm so hungry!

465
00:39:53,110 --> 00:39:54,750
- Oh, wow!
- Ah, the food's here.

466
00:39:54,880 --> 00:39:57,500
I so wanna take Khao Gully back with me.

467
00:39:57,870 --> 00:39:59,850
- "Khao" means?
- To eat.

468
00:39:59,980 --> 00:40:02,780
- And "gully?"
- Street. Eat street.

469
00:40:02,910 --> 00:40:04,430
Stop testing me, Sher.

470
00:40:07,170 --> 00:40:08,450
How did you two meet?

471
00:40:09,240 --> 00:40:11,220
At Shiv Sagar restaurant,
behind Wilson College.

472
00:40:11,650 --> 00:40:14,580
It was jam-packed,
loud and noisy.

473
00:40:14,710 --> 00:40:17,470
She sat at my table
and we just started talking.

474
00:40:19,240 --> 00:40:21,330
Our people look at caste and creed.

475
00:40:21,460 --> 00:40:24,270
Their system is cool.
They look straight into your eyes.

476
00:40:26,780 --> 00:40:27,780
Here.

477
00:40:32,800 --> 00:40:34,450
Thank you for today, man.

478
00:40:35,490 --> 00:40:38,480
What a guy!
No need to thank me. Eat!

479
00:40:38,950 --> 00:40:40,640
He's outstanding with lyrics.

480
00:40:40,770 --> 00:40:42,920
- Really?
- Yeah, he'll explode soon.

481
00:40:52,250 --> 00:40:53,250
Yes?

482
00:40:54,390 --> 00:40:55,890
Who are you talking to?

483
00:40:56,020 --> 00:40:57,180
Spider Man.

484
00:40:57,310 --> 00:40:59,020
Stop prying and sleep.

485
00:41:08,590 --> 00:41:09,390
Hi!

486
00:41:09,520 --> 00:41:11,480
Wow! Why so happy?

487
00:41:11,610 --> 00:41:14,640
What can I say?
Today was just amazing.

488
00:41:15,030 --> 00:41:16,480
Start from the beginning.

489
00:41:18,900 --> 00:41:20,020
Tell me.

490
00:41:22,260 --> 00:41:24,750
If you suddenly had this big desire...

491
00:41:25,690 --> 00:41:27,340
is it worth chasing?

492
00:41:28,030 --> 00:41:29,060
Always!

493
00:41:29,670 --> 00:41:32,850
After all, "Murad" means desire.
You've got nothing to fear.

494
00:41:34,380 --> 00:41:35,940
How come you're so fearless?

495
00:41:36,230 --> 00:41:38,960
I have to be,
to achieve everything I want.

496
00:41:39,280 --> 00:41:42,250
And what exactly do you want
to achieve?

497
00:41:42,540 --> 00:41:44,010
My own medical practice.

498
00:41:45,650 --> 00:41:46,650
Marriage with you.

499
00:41:46,900 --> 00:41:48,770
Oh, so I come second?

500
00:41:50,220 --> 00:41:53,330
When life gives you something good,
shut up and take it.

501
00:41:58,410 --> 00:42:02,270
I'm going to work late tomorrow.
I'll see you at the bus stop.

502
00:42:02,400 --> 00:42:03,400
OK.

503
00:42:11,290 --> 00:42:15,010
Check Srikant out
He calls himself a lion.

504
00:42:15,530 --> 00:42:18,140
He wants to fight me
The sissy dandelion.

505
00:42:18,440 --> 00:42:21,060
You want to be a rapper
But you can't, Mr. DJ.

506
00:42:21,190 --> 00:42:24,800
This is no wedding! On this battlefield
You'll lose your way.

507
00:42:29,730 --> 00:42:33,200
Spread the word
In each and every area code.

508
00:42:33,620 --> 00:42:37,140
He calls himself a lion
But looks like a toad.

509
00:42:37,610 --> 00:42:40,890
I'm like fire, you're a liar
I'm the king, you're a plaything

510
00:42:41,020 --> 00:42:43,600
I'm the big show with the dough
I'm too killer, bro.

511
00:42:49,120 --> 00:42:52,630
Your image is fake
And so are your rhymes.

512
00:42:53,020 --> 00:42:56,160
The S on my chest makes me
The king of the times.

513
00:42:57,080 --> 00:42:59,920
He thinks he'll knock me out in the fight.

514
00:43:00,050 --> 00:43:02,790
But he'll be singing
On my wedding night.

515
00:43:09,510 --> 00:43:12,250
Swim away, Nemo
You're in the shark zone.

516
00:43:12,730 --> 00:43:15,360
I'm the fire that will burn you
To the bone.

517
00:43:16,430 --> 00:43:20,270
Like Arjun from the Mahabharat
My arrow will hit this bird in the eye.

518
00:43:22,190 --> 00:43:25,790
Your father can't save you here
Go home to Delhi, run or fly.

519
00:43:28,830 --> 00:43:31,980
That S on your chest
That's a good start.

520
00:43:32,110 --> 00:43:35,440
Now let me complete that work of art.

521
00:43:36,070 --> 00:43:39,410
S-H-E-R!

522
00:43:39,540 --> 00:43:42,740
My name's heavy for your chest
Four like you won't pass the test.

523
00:43:47,720 --> 00:43:49,880
Sure, I'm a wedding DJ.

524
00:43:50,650 --> 00:43:55,340
Earn for my brother, tolerate my father
Spit my anger into the mic.

525
00:43:59,200 --> 00:44:02,470
You guys know my name
You dance to my beat.

526
00:44:02,600 --> 00:44:04,980
At the last wedding
Your sister felt my heat.

527
00:44:07,410 --> 00:44:10,280
You've got a lot to learn
So come along.

528
00:44:10,540 --> 00:44:13,520
Your girl hears my beat
And twerks to my song.

529
00:44:13,650 --> 00:44:17,010
Twerks to my song! Twerks to my song!

530
00:44:20,390 --> 00:44:22,520
This is my turf, man!

531
00:44:23,440 --> 00:44:26,340
This is my turf, you get that?

532
00:44:27,220 --> 00:44:28,570
Come on, Homie.

533
00:44:36,870 --> 00:44:39,790
Throw your hands up
If you're real in the game.

534
00:44:41,530 --> 00:44:44,640
I said throw your hands up
If you're real in the game.

535
00:44:44,770 --> 00:44:47,730
His hands are down 'coz we ain't the same.

536
00:44:47,860 --> 00:44:50,610
His face is ugly
His clothes fake.

537
00:44:50,740 --> 00:44:53,730
This is my turf
Go back to your street.

538
00:44:59,120 --> 00:45:02,980
Fake is your T-shirt
Fake are your stripes.

539
00:45:03,110 --> 00:45:05,950
Fake is your rap
Fake is your type.

540
00:45:09,590 --> 00:45:11,970
Why you quiet now, baby?

541
00:45:13,970 --> 00:45:15,920
Waiting for Sher to save the day?

542
00:45:16,970 --> 00:45:20,500
Is he gonna come tell you what to say?

543
00:45:23,120 --> 00:45:26,270
My words flow like a river
While he's a choker

544
00:45:26,400 --> 00:45:29,430
I'm the hero, villain
I'm Batman, the Joker.

545
00:45:29,560 --> 00:45:31,730
Lie down already so I can crossover.

546
00:45:31,860 --> 00:45:34,860
'Coz this ain't a rap battle
This is a walkover!

547
00:45:46,880 --> 00:45:48,710
He's got no reply.

548
00:45:48,840 --> 00:45:50,900
He's got nothing!

549
00:45:51,030 --> 00:45:54,210
Choke! Choke! Choke!

550
00:45:54,520 --> 00:45:56,760
Let's see what he's got.

551
00:45:57,760 --> 00:45:59,520
You think he's got a comeback?

552
00:46:02,170 --> 00:46:04,120
He doesn't have what it takes.

553
00:46:15,960 --> 00:46:17,980
This is how rap battles are, man.

554
00:46:18,270 --> 00:46:21,980
Don't take them so seriously.
They're just big mouths.

555
00:46:22,110 --> 00:46:24,200
No, man. They've seen the world.

556
00:46:24,670 --> 00:46:28,110
Focus on yourself and what you've seen
living in Dharavi.

557
00:46:28,450 --> 00:46:29,800
Think what you have.

558
00:46:30,560 --> 00:46:32,190
I've got nothing.

559
00:46:33,410 --> 00:46:34,610
Nothing?

560
00:46:38,250 --> 00:46:41,880
All the great artists
were once broke and hungry.

561
00:46:42,310 --> 00:46:44,420
Starving. They would eat anything.

562
00:46:44,860 --> 00:46:47,500
They stole beats
and turned that hunger into stories.

563
00:46:47,860 --> 00:46:49,200
Then they got somewhere.

564
00:46:49,690 --> 00:46:50,690
Follow?

565
00:46:51,330 --> 00:46:53,590
All you need is your truth...

566
00:46:54,220 --> 00:46:56,450
and that lava within,
just let it erupt!

567
00:46:58,460 --> 00:46:59,870
Let it flow.

568
00:47:00,000 --> 00:47:01,610
Let it flow!

569
00:47:01,740 --> 00:47:03,030
Let your truth show.

570
00:47:03,160 --> 00:47:05,680
Let falsehood go.

571
00:47:07,220 --> 00:47:11,270
Chop up the onions and tomatoes,
put it all in the pressure cooker.

572
00:47:11,400 --> 00:47:15,870
Let it cook for three whistles
and serve it, that's it.

573
00:47:16,170 --> 00:47:19,140
Is it so easy? I could never make dal.

574
00:47:19,860 --> 00:47:21,150
What's so tough about it?

575
00:48:37,650 --> 00:48:40,860
What are you seeking?
Ask yourself!

576
00:48:40,990 --> 00:48:44,030
What are you seeking?
Ask yourself!

577
00:48:44,160 --> 00:48:47,430
What are you seeking?
Ask yourself!

578
00:48:47,560 --> 00:48:50,730
What are you seeking?
Ask yourself!

579
00:48:50,860 --> 00:48:54,030
What I live through
How would you know?

580
00:48:54,160 --> 00:48:58,520
You know nothing of my story or pain.

581
00:48:58,900 --> 00:49:03,610
Where I live, what I endure
How few friends I have.

582
00:49:03,980 --> 00:49:05,680
So now I stay mute.

583
00:49:05,810 --> 00:49:07,350
In a town of deaf brutes.

584
00:49:07,480 --> 00:49:10,610
Empty platitudes are empty

585
00:49:10,740 --> 00:49:13,640
I ask no one for help

586
00:49:13,770 --> 00:49:15,600
I bow my head before God

587
00:49:15,730 --> 00:49:17,180
I plead to be forgiven.

588
00:49:17,310 --> 00:49:18,810
Just let it flow.

589
00:49:18,940 --> 00:49:20,480
Let your truth show.

590
00:49:35,480 --> 00:49:36,650
Yes, ma'am?

591
00:49:37,680 --> 00:49:38,990
OK.

592
00:50:42,490 --> 00:50:45,520
You're near
Yet we're a world apart.

593
00:50:46,830 --> 00:50:48,980
Why are my hands tied?

594
00:50:52,360 --> 00:50:54,720
I cannot console you.

595
00:50:55,610 --> 00:50:57,440
I cannot reach out to you.

596
00:50:58,520 --> 00:51:00,440
I cannot wipe your tears.

597
00:51:00,840 --> 00:51:02,450
My standing won't let me.

598
00:51:04,480 --> 00:51:05,670
I am here.

599
00:51:06,100 --> 00:51:07,390
So are you.

600
00:51:08,300 --> 00:51:10,530
But the truth is
I'm in one world.

601
00:51:10,930 --> 00:51:12,530
You're in another.

602
00:51:13,380 --> 00:51:16,740
You're near
Yet we're a world apart.

603
00:51:18,920 --> 00:51:20,780
Why are my hands tied?

604
00:51:29,230 --> 00:51:31,640
Can anyone tell me
Why this divide, this disparity?

605
00:51:31,770 --> 00:51:34,510
Who pulls the strings?
Who writes the story?

606
00:51:40,380 --> 00:51:42,770
Can anyone tell me
Why this divide, this disparity?

607
00:51:42,900 --> 00:51:45,740
Who pulls the strings?
Who writes the story?

608
00:51:48,980 --> 00:51:53,280
Murad, stop talking to yourself.

609
00:51:53,850 --> 00:51:55,630
It brings bad luck.

610
00:51:56,360 --> 00:51:57,550
Go to sleep.

611
00:51:59,220 --> 00:52:01,640
Can anyone tell me
Why this divide, this disparity?

612
00:52:01,770 --> 00:52:04,440
Who pulls the strings?
Who writes the story?

613
00:52:09,300 --> 00:52:12,180
It's getting away! Grab the bus.

614
00:52:12,310 --> 00:52:15,420
- Hi, brother.
- It's like your school bus.

615
00:52:16,920 --> 00:52:18,350
Come on in.

616
00:52:18,750 --> 00:52:21,390
Little men, this is my friend Murad.
Say hello.

617
00:52:21,520 --> 00:52:22,630
Hello!

618
00:52:22,760 --> 00:52:25,280
Murad, where are you from?

619
00:52:25,980 --> 00:52:27,400
Some Muslim ghetto?

620
00:52:28,500 --> 00:52:33,150
- Are you a bum like my Srikant?
- Ignore him, man.

621
00:52:36,230 --> 00:52:38,860
Bro! Mind blowing!

622
00:52:39,220 --> 00:52:41,880
- My treasure.
- What a moron!

623
00:52:42,240 --> 00:52:44,980
Locks his sneakers in there
like they're jewels!

624
00:52:45,110 --> 00:52:48,160
Srikant, put them in a bank locker.

625
00:52:48,290 --> 00:52:49,640
Sure.

626
00:52:50,540 --> 00:52:53,180
- I'll be out for dinner, sis.
- Okay.

627
00:52:53,310 --> 00:52:56,350
Parties all night and calls it work.

628
00:52:56,480 --> 00:52:58,610
- Bloody goof-off.
- Shut up, you boozer.

629
00:52:58,740 --> 00:53:00,790
Calling yourself "Sher" doesn't...

630
00:53:01,300 --> 00:53:03,540
make you a lion.

631
00:53:07,260 --> 00:53:08,700
Where's your mother?

632
00:53:09,400 --> 00:53:10,400
Ran away.

633
00:53:25,730 --> 00:53:26,730
You wrote this?

634
00:53:27,790 --> 00:53:29,060
We should record it.

635
00:53:29,190 --> 00:53:30,060
But I have.

636
00:53:30,190 --> 00:53:32,280
Not like this, Homie.
In a studio.

637
00:53:32,410 --> 00:53:34,380
Then we'll shoot a video
and put it on YouTube.

638
00:53:34,780 --> 00:53:36,340
So you think the song is OK?

639
00:53:36,960 --> 00:53:38,310
Some lines were off tempo.

640
00:53:38,440 --> 00:53:39,560
Tempo? Meaning?

641
00:53:39,690 --> 00:53:40,890
Tempo means...

642
00:53:41,020 --> 00:53:43,430
One, two, three, four...

643
00:53:43,560 --> 00:53:45,990
Yo, Homies, what's going on?

644
00:53:46,120 --> 00:53:48,430
Wake up in the morning
And have tea lying on the lawn.

645
00:53:48,560 --> 00:53:51,900
When the sun comes along
Take a hit from your bong.

646
00:53:52,030 --> 00:53:53,380
Fly high and sing your song!

647
00:53:54,470 --> 00:53:57,390
What is rap? Rhythm and poetry.

648
00:53:57,820 --> 00:53:59,000
Poetry, you have.

649
00:53:59,430 --> 00:54:02,200
Now follow the rhythm, my man.

650
00:54:03,150 --> 00:54:04,150
OK?

651
00:54:06,430 --> 00:54:07,820
So you liked it?

652
00:54:10,290 --> 00:54:11,790
Chill out, bro.

653
00:54:11,920 --> 00:54:14,510
There's a storm inside you, Homie.
A storm!

654
00:54:14,770 --> 00:54:15,770
What say, Chintoo?

655
00:54:15,830 --> 00:54:16,890
That's hard, man.

656
00:54:17,020 --> 00:54:18,620
You're good, bro.

657
00:55:25,000 --> 00:55:29,190
Stand a couple of inches away
from the pop filter.

658
00:55:29,970 --> 00:55:32,290
When you exhale, turn away.

659
00:55:35,370 --> 00:55:38,450
Just let it all out into the mic.

660
00:55:39,200 --> 00:55:41,680
Let the lava erupt, Homie!
Come on.

661
00:55:49,770 --> 00:55:50,900
Record this, Tony.

662
00:56:04,700 --> 00:56:07,150
Can anyone tell me
Why this divide, this disparity?

663
00:56:07,280 --> 00:56:09,660
Who pulls the strings?
Who writes the story?

664
00:56:09,790 --> 00:56:11,640
Starving babies cower.

665
00:56:11,770 --> 00:56:14,600
Next to sky scraping towers
What's this divide?

666
00:56:14,730 --> 00:56:18,360
Your money has tenacity
You rule with audacity.

667
00:56:18,490 --> 00:56:20,020
Your car's big as my home.

668
00:56:20,150 --> 00:56:23,050
Our bellies empty
Yours full of gold.

669
00:56:23,180 --> 00:56:25,470
What's this divide? Tell me!

670
00:56:26,210 --> 00:56:28,310
Even with this closeness.

671
00:56:28,960 --> 00:56:30,490
There's a chasm between us.

672
00:56:31,330 --> 00:56:33,270
My hands are tied.

673
00:56:33,930 --> 00:56:35,530
There's a chasm between us.

674
00:56:36,440 --> 00:56:38,550
Even with this closeness.

675
00:56:39,150 --> 00:56:40,680
There's a chasm between us.

676
00:56:41,590 --> 00:56:43,220
My hands are tied.

677
00:56:44,270 --> 00:56:45,350
There's a chasm between us.

678
00:56:45,480 --> 00:56:47,440
One thing's for sure.

679
00:56:47,570 --> 00:56:50,020
Your heart and money are impure.

680
00:56:50,150 --> 00:56:52,810
We drift between guns and ash.

681
00:56:52,940 --> 00:56:55,600
We sleep on trash
You lounge on cash.

682
00:56:55,730 --> 00:56:58,060
Two worlds One black, one white.

683
00:56:58,190 --> 00:56:59,640
Few masters, many slaves.

684
00:56:59,770 --> 00:57:02,020
You're lonely in your palace.

685
00:57:02,150 --> 00:57:04,310
While we fight for space.

686
00:57:04,440 --> 00:57:06,140
We're the rats in your race!

687
00:57:07,060 --> 00:57:08,690
Even with this closeness.

688
00:57:09,800 --> 00:57:11,520
There's a chasm between us.

689
00:57:12,350 --> 00:57:13,810
My hands are tied.

690
00:57:14,930 --> 00:57:16,480
There's a chasm between us.

691
00:57:17,300 --> 00:57:19,040
Even with this closeness.

692
00:57:19,800 --> 00:57:21,480
There's a chasm between us.

693
00:57:22,590 --> 00:57:24,110
My hands are tied.

694
00:57:25,080 --> 00:57:26,390
There's a chasm between us.

695
00:57:26,520 --> 00:57:28,330
My family is torn apart.

696
00:57:28,460 --> 00:57:30,840
No room, only walls.

697
00:57:30,970 --> 00:57:33,060
Troubled minds, empty bellies.

698
00:57:33,190 --> 00:57:36,190
They say it's my fate
This illusion I will break.

699
00:57:36,670 --> 00:57:39,850
Leaning on my shoulder, she weeps.

700
00:57:39,980 --> 00:57:41,640
My mother, my soldier.

701
00:57:41,770 --> 00:57:44,180
Your lullaby is now my battle cry

702
00:57:44,310 --> 00:57:47,480
I'll make the impossible possible, Ma!

703
00:57:48,170 --> 00:57:50,030
Even with this closeness.

704
00:57:50,910 --> 00:57:52,540
There's a chasm between us.

705
00:57:53,450 --> 00:57:55,060
My hands are tied.

706
00:57:56,040 --> 00:57:57,610
There's a chasm between us.

707
00:57:58,570 --> 00:58:00,240
Even with this closeness.

708
00:58:01,170 --> 00:58:02,750
There's a chasm between us.

709
00:58:03,730 --> 00:58:05,220
My hands are tied.

710
00:58:06,260 --> 00:58:07,960
There's a chasm between us.

711
00:58:41,680 --> 00:58:42,490
Good?

712
00:58:42,620 --> 00:58:43,620
Good.

713
00:58:44,120 --> 00:58:45,140
Export.

714
00:58:55,830 --> 00:58:56,890
Export!

715
00:58:57,210 --> 00:58:59,590
Not export, Homie. Explode!

716
00:59:01,650 --> 00:59:03,460
- Feels good, right?
- Yes.

717
00:59:06,640 --> 00:59:07,640
No, thanks.

718
00:59:07,830 --> 00:59:08,860
You don't drink?

719
00:59:10,330 --> 00:59:11,620
Want something else?

720
00:59:11,870 --> 00:59:14,560
A good name.
He needs a good name.

721
00:59:15,730 --> 00:59:17,030
What's wrong with Murad?

722
00:59:17,160 --> 00:59:18,220
You're a rapper now.

723
00:59:18,350 --> 00:59:20,410
You need a rapper's name.
Like MC Sher.

724
00:59:20,540 --> 00:59:21,990
How did you pick MC Sher?

725
00:59:22,570 --> 00:59:25,330
My ma used to call me Sher.
And I am a lion.

726
00:59:25,740 --> 00:59:26,740
And you?

727
00:59:29,040 --> 00:59:31,080
Me? Just a guy from the street.

728
00:59:32,160 --> 00:59:33,720
He's just a gully boy.

729
00:59:38,970 --> 00:59:39,970
What?

730
00:59:40,920 --> 00:59:42,050
Gully Boy!

731
00:59:46,790 --> 00:59:47,850
Gully Boy?

732
00:59:49,230 --> 00:59:50,270
Gully Boy.

733
00:59:50,550 --> 00:59:52,170
- Why not?
- Gully boy.

734
00:59:52,300 --> 00:59:53,730
- Sounds good.
- Sweet!

735
00:59:53,860 --> 00:59:56,460
Gully Boy? It's hard, man.

736
00:59:56,690 --> 00:59:58,060
- Yeah.
- Gully Boy.

737
01:00:03,200 --> 01:00:05,480
Gully Boy. Yeah!

738
01:00:05,610 --> 01:00:08,230
Homie, it's great. Gully Boy!

739
01:00:09,950 --> 01:00:11,350
I love you, Gemma!

740
01:00:11,480 --> 01:00:12,850
You're a gem!

741
01:00:28,080 --> 01:00:29,430
Gully Boy.

742
01:00:31,960 --> 01:00:33,200
Will this work?

743
01:00:33,330 --> 01:00:34,920
It's a proper medical certificate.

744
01:00:35,230 --> 01:00:37,660
If it doesn't work, tell the dean
to call the doctor.

745
01:00:37,790 --> 01:00:39,140
You mean your father?

746
01:00:39,460 --> 01:00:43,580
No, I mean me!
Your doctor, Safeena Firdausi.

747
01:00:43,710 --> 01:00:45,070
Get it now?

748
01:00:45,200 --> 01:00:47,090
Sure, I get it.

749
01:00:47,220 --> 01:00:50,190
Murad, my brother listens
to your song on a loop.

750
01:00:50,320 --> 01:00:51,530
Really?

751
01:00:51,660 --> 01:00:54,030
Yes. Recording any more songs?

752
01:00:54,760 --> 01:00:56,110
I want to.

753
01:00:56,240 --> 01:00:58,890
We'll think about it once he's graduates.

754
01:00:59,020 --> 01:01:01,930
Your brother can listen
to the same song till then.

755
01:01:03,420 --> 01:01:07,500
Come on, let me enjoy that feeling.
Don't be like that.

756
01:01:09,030 --> 01:01:10,460
What's this, huh?

757
01:01:10,590 --> 01:01:14,270
What's this gibberish?
Your notes are a mess.

758
01:01:14,630 --> 01:01:15,930
Might as well puke on them.

759
01:01:16,060 --> 01:01:17,860
I write some things in code.

760
01:01:17,990 --> 01:01:20,030
What code, idiot?

761
01:01:21,070 --> 01:01:23,490
What's this mean: "tymc"?

762
01:01:23,620 --> 01:01:26,350
It's TYMC! TY...

763
01:01:28,520 --> 01:01:30,380
TYMC...?

764
01:01:30,510 --> 01:01:32,470
I could slap you.

765
01:01:34,380 --> 01:01:36,170
We're both going to fail the exams.

766
01:01:39,530 --> 01:01:40,780
Let's study this evening.

767
01:01:41,930 --> 01:01:43,340
You have plans?

768
01:01:43,700 --> 01:01:44,570
What's the comment?

769
01:01:44,700 --> 01:01:46,400
What kind of name is Sky?

770
01:01:47,400 --> 01:01:49,110
Sounds like a Scot name.

771
01:01:49,240 --> 01:01:52,310
"Nice lyrics, but groove sucks!"
Who's this smart-pants?

772
01:01:52,450 --> 01:01:55,350
Here, let's give him something
to chew on.

773
01:01:57,530 --> 01:01:59,630
Hi there, Sky

774
01:01:59,760 --> 01:02:00,950
I'm the kinda guy...

775
01:02:01,080 --> 01:02:06,690
Whose rhymes will shoot you down
from up high.

776
01:02:08,170 --> 01:02:11,650
That's hard, man.
You're quick with these tricks!

777
01:02:12,170 --> 01:02:14,000
Hey, look at this.

778
01:02:15,050 --> 01:02:18,570
"You're lucky you've caught my eye."

779
01:02:18,700 --> 01:02:20,480
Gully Boy, I'm not gonna lie.

780
01:02:20,770 --> 01:02:24,350
With my beats
Your lyrics might just get by...

781
01:02:24,480 --> 01:02:26,080
Hard!

782
01:02:26,550 --> 01:02:27,740
Bro!

783
01:02:27,870 --> 01:02:30,740
You threw a curveball,
but he hit a home run!

784
01:02:30,870 --> 01:02:32,750
Send us the beat!

785
01:02:32,880 --> 01:02:35,770
- He won't send it.
- He will... see.

786
01:02:42,930 --> 01:02:43,960
Solid.

787
01:02:48,680 --> 01:02:51,030
Want to meet?

788
01:02:51,160 --> 01:02:53,320
- Straight away?
- Why not?

789
01:02:55,020 --> 01:02:56,100
"When?"

790
01:03:06,360 --> 01:03:07,360
Water.

791
01:03:11,290 --> 01:03:12,450
When are your exams?

792
01:03:13,060 --> 01:03:14,080
Next week.

793
01:03:14,550 --> 01:03:15,810
Then come see me.

794
01:03:16,380 --> 01:03:18,990
He's very smart. He'll learn fast.

795
01:03:19,120 --> 01:03:21,330
- Ma.
- Being smart isn't enough.

796
01:03:22,160 --> 01:03:24,260
- You need the right attitude.
- You're right.

797
01:03:24,610 --> 01:03:28,160
You won't get a job on a platter
just because you're my nephew.

798
01:03:28,710 --> 01:03:31,700
Why should he get special treatment?

799
01:03:33,040 --> 01:03:36,550
He's got to keep his head down
and work hard like we do.

800
01:03:36,930 --> 01:03:38,350
It's different in my line.

801
01:03:40,290 --> 01:03:41,830
Sales require brains.

802
01:03:42,310 --> 01:03:44,620
You've got to show confidence.

803
01:03:45,500 --> 01:03:48,150
Our product has serious competition
in the market.

804
01:03:49,000 --> 01:03:51,050
Don't worry, Uncle. I get it.

805
01:03:51,830 --> 01:03:55,790
I'll learn everything well.
You'll have no problem.

806
01:04:05,110 --> 01:04:07,780
You didn't tell me Murad is a singer?

807
01:04:07,910 --> 01:04:08,910
What?

808
01:04:10,430 --> 01:04:12,120
Suhail showed it to me.

809
01:04:14,490 --> 01:04:15,540
He sings well.

810
01:04:20,860 --> 01:04:21,900
What's this?

811
01:04:22,790 --> 01:04:24,220
- What happened?
- Shut up!

812
01:04:24,680 --> 01:04:25,800
I'm talking!

813
01:04:31,960 --> 01:04:33,420
What is this?

814
01:04:35,420 --> 01:04:37,190
- Rap.
- What?

815
01:04:37,320 --> 01:04:39,650
It's rap. I wrote it.

816
01:04:42,820 --> 01:04:44,780
"Let him study!"

817
01:04:44,910 --> 01:04:46,940
He's studying this crap!

818
01:04:49,710 --> 01:04:52,070
- He won't do it again.
- Shut your mouth!

819
01:04:54,120 --> 01:04:57,190
I've sunk so much money
into his education.

820
01:04:57,690 --> 01:04:59,460
On top of that,
he eats like a horse.

821
01:05:04,890 --> 01:05:06,540
Cat caught your tongue?

822
01:05:10,640 --> 01:05:13,240
If I catch you again...

823
01:05:14,720 --> 01:05:15,820
that will be it.

824
01:05:16,820 --> 01:05:17,820
Get inside.

825
01:05:29,480 --> 01:05:30,730
I liked your song.

826
01:05:41,880 --> 01:05:42,880
What did she say?

827
01:05:55,510 --> 01:05:57,490
- MC Sher's list. I'm Murad.
- OK.

828
01:06:14,550 --> 01:06:15,610
Bro.

829
01:06:16,090 --> 01:06:17,750
- Where were you?
- Is Sky here?

830
01:06:18,520 --> 01:06:19,620
Check him out.

831
01:06:22,100 --> 01:06:23,180
Who's he?

832
01:06:23,620 --> 01:06:24,770
Kaam Bhaari.

833
01:06:24,900 --> 01:06:25,970
From where?

834
01:06:26,490 --> 01:06:28,050
Kandivali 101.

835
01:06:33,870 --> 01:06:35,120
Awesome.

836
01:06:44,880 --> 01:06:46,440
The little guy is great.

837
01:06:49,280 --> 01:06:50,780
Uh, Gully Boy?

838
01:06:50,910 --> 01:06:51,910
Yeah.

839
01:06:51,950 --> 01:06:53,070
Hi, I'm Sky.

840
01:06:54,700 --> 01:06:56,490
- Nice to meet you.
- Hi.

841
01:06:57,280 --> 01:06:58,420
Sky!

842
01:07:00,410 --> 01:07:01,770
Hi, Sky.

843
01:07:04,240 --> 01:07:05,880
Why are you boys looking
at me like that?

844
01:07:06,370 --> 01:07:08,600
- We thought you were a guy.
- Yeah.

845
01:07:08,730 --> 01:07:10,260
Sorry, I'm a girl.

846
01:07:10,390 --> 01:07:13,230
Makes no difference to us,
girl or boy.

847
01:07:13,510 --> 01:07:14,720
Wonderful! And you are?

848
01:07:14,850 --> 01:07:15,660
Sher.

849
01:07:15,790 --> 01:07:19,450
MC Sher? No way!
Aren't you up next?

850
01:07:21,060 --> 01:07:22,430
A beer for me, please.

851
01:07:23,390 --> 01:07:24,390
One beer.

852
01:07:24,600 --> 01:07:25,420
And you?

853
01:07:25,550 --> 01:07:27,140
He doesn't drink.

854
01:07:27,650 --> 01:07:28,770
But he talks?

855
01:07:30,740 --> 01:07:31,910
I'm sorry. What's your name?

856
01:07:32,040 --> 01:07:33,280
- Murad.
- Murad.

857
01:07:33,790 --> 01:07:37,280
So, I study music programming
at Berklee.

858
01:07:37,780 --> 01:07:38,950
Berklee?

859
01:07:39,200 --> 01:07:41,850
It's a music school in Boston. America.

860
01:07:42,450 --> 01:07:45,400
An entire school just for music?

861
01:07:45,720 --> 01:07:46,560
Yeah.

862
01:07:46,690 --> 01:07:48,800
It happens there, abroad.

863
01:07:48,930 --> 01:07:50,990
Anyway, I need to produce a track.

864
01:07:51,120 --> 01:07:55,020
I was considering recording in India
and found you online.

865
01:07:57,550 --> 01:07:58,550
Actually...

866
01:07:58,670 --> 01:08:02,040
Sher's made the track.
I couldn't have done it without him.

867
01:08:02,170 --> 01:08:03,200
- Oh, really?
- Yeah.

868
01:08:03,330 --> 01:08:06,190
Then why don't you both
collaborate with me?

869
01:08:07,450 --> 01:08:08,950
Collaborate? How?

870
01:08:09,080 --> 01:08:10,910
You write and perform.

871
01:08:11,040 --> 01:08:12,700
I'll produce and program.

872
01:08:12,830 --> 01:08:16,190
I've got a budget.
I will cover the studio and video.

873
01:08:16,900 --> 01:08:19,520
Then we'll release it.
Copyright 50/50.

874
01:08:19,860 --> 01:08:21,470
- 50/50?
- Yeah.

875
01:08:22,860 --> 01:08:23,910
What?

876
01:08:24,890 --> 01:08:26,360
You signed to a label?

877
01:08:27,840 --> 01:08:29,120
You're under contract?

878
01:08:35,260 --> 01:08:36,260
What's funny?

879
01:08:41,810 --> 01:08:44,280
I'll kill you, Murad. I have to go now.

880
01:08:44,410 --> 01:08:45,870
Sorry, sorry, sorry.

881
01:08:46,940 --> 01:08:47,940
What happened?

882
01:08:48,040 --> 01:08:49,870
We met that musician.

883
01:08:50,150 --> 01:08:50,950
So?

884
01:08:51,080 --> 01:08:55,750
So she wants us to make
a track with her.

885
01:08:56,030 --> 01:08:57,100
"She?"

886
01:08:57,430 --> 01:09:00,070
She's a girl!
She studies music in America.

887
01:09:00,200 --> 01:09:03,750
Music Studies! Can you imagine?

888
01:09:04,260 --> 01:09:06,410
- Is she rich?
- Looks like it.

889
01:09:06,540 --> 01:09:11,390
But she's chill, no attitude.
I think it'll be fun working with her.

890
01:09:12,470 --> 01:09:14,290
So you're going to make music with her?

891
01:09:15,790 --> 01:09:17,290
And Sher too.

892
01:09:18,260 --> 01:09:21,220
We'll record in a proper studio.

893
01:09:21,350 --> 01:09:22,490
And your exams?

894
01:09:22,620 --> 01:09:24,020
I'll figure it out.

895
01:09:25,130 --> 01:09:27,820
I've got a job at Uncle Ateeq's.
Don't worry so much.

896
01:09:30,780 --> 01:09:32,280
I want to do this.

897
01:09:32,410 --> 01:09:33,580
So do it.

898
01:09:37,020 --> 01:09:38,020
See you tomorrow.

899
01:09:38,230 --> 01:09:39,390
Wait a little.

900
01:09:39,520 --> 01:09:41,170
I have to go. Look at the time.

901
01:09:41,660 --> 01:09:44,250
Just five minutes. Safeena!

902
01:09:56,140 --> 01:09:58,380
Now what? Can't we talk inside?

903
01:09:58,510 --> 01:09:59,690
Not in front of everyone.

904
01:10:00,600 --> 01:10:01,600
It's private.

905
01:10:01,640 --> 01:10:05,540
We can't all live together.
Your woman fancies Murad's singing.

906
01:10:05,830 --> 01:10:07,010
There will be trouble.

907
01:10:07,790 --> 01:10:09,300
Must I buy another house?

908
01:10:09,590 --> 01:10:12,450
Should I work overtime
while your son is busy singing?

909
01:10:12,580 --> 01:10:15,120
Did you ask me before remarrying?
Now fix it.

910
01:10:15,250 --> 01:10:17,050
Tell Murad not to strut about.

911
01:10:17,180 --> 01:10:19,710
Brilliant solution!

912
01:10:20,040 --> 01:10:24,440
If you're leaving it up to me,
pack your bags and get out!

913
01:10:25,100 --> 01:10:27,130
You want me to leave?

914
01:10:27,260 --> 01:10:29,200
- I should go?
- Stop!

915
01:10:30,600 --> 01:10:32,920
- I'm being polite.
- Polite?

916
01:10:33,610 --> 01:10:36,210
You brought another woman to my bed.

917
01:10:36,340 --> 01:10:37,380
Yes, I did!

918
01:10:37,680 --> 01:10:39,600
You weren't of much use
on that bed anyway!

919
01:10:44,880 --> 01:10:47,090
And did you ever learn
how to touch me?

920
01:10:48,470 --> 01:10:51,940
Did I replace you
with someone else, huh?

921
01:10:53,030 --> 01:10:55,640
Did I? Open the door.

922
01:10:56,780 --> 01:10:57,960
Open!

923
01:10:58,090 --> 01:11:02,040
I'll bring someone into this room.
It's my turn now.

924
01:11:02,170 --> 01:11:03,410
Ma!

925
01:11:47,480 --> 01:11:49,490
- Hi, you're Gully Boy, right?
- Yeah.

926
01:11:49,620 --> 01:11:51,690
Terrific song, man! Nicely done.

927
01:11:51,820 --> 01:11:52,890
Thanks, man.

928
01:11:54,890 --> 01:11:57,680
Gully Boy! Getting mobbed, huh?

929
01:11:57,880 --> 01:12:00,590
That was just one guy.
Don't be a smart-ass.

930
01:12:01,140 --> 01:12:03,470
Had fun failing the exam?

931
01:13:01,720 --> 01:13:06,340
"Where's that chick from your street?
Oh! She's now in my street."

932
01:13:06,980 --> 01:13:09,810
- That's so funny. I love it!
- Great lyrics.

933
01:13:11,260 --> 01:13:14,010
You know where we'll shoot it?
On your street.

934
01:13:14,690 --> 01:13:16,090
On your street!

935
01:13:21,370 --> 01:13:22,810
What about your father?

936
01:13:25,240 --> 01:13:28,090
We'll see about it. It is what it is.

937
01:13:57,190 --> 01:13:59,120
What's up, Gully Boy?

938
01:13:59,250 --> 01:14:00,880
What's crackin', MC Sher?

939
01:14:01,010 --> 01:14:03,270
Let's do something for our public, man!

940
01:14:03,400 --> 01:14:05,250
For our people, man!

941
01:14:05,380 --> 01:14:07,170
For our brothers and sisters!

942
01:14:07,300 --> 01:14:08,300
For sure!

943
01:14:08,430 --> 01:14:09,430
Where you at?

944
01:14:09,550 --> 01:14:11,280
Bombay 17, man. And you?

945
01:14:21,680 --> 01:14:23,590
Did current spike your hair?

946
01:14:23,720 --> 01:14:24,760
Cut it out!

947
01:14:24,890 --> 01:14:26,240
He's zapped!

948
01:14:31,990 --> 01:14:33,960
Your biggest dog is a poodle
On my street.

949
01:14:34,090 --> 01:14:36,320
The entire city echoes in my street.

950
01:14:36,450 --> 01:14:38,430
A church, mosque and temple
On my street.

951
01:14:38,560 --> 01:14:40,520
Talk about my mum
Get whacked on my street.

952
01:14:40,650 --> 01:14:42,880
If the cops come, we're in trouble
On my street.

953
01:14:43,010 --> 01:14:45,170
The best of life is on my street.

954
01:14:45,300 --> 01:14:49,380
Where's that chick from your street?
Oh! She's now in my street.

955
01:14:49,510 --> 01:14:53,800
In my street!

956
01:14:53,930 --> 01:14:56,010
Your biggest dog is a poodle
On my street.

957
01:14:56,140 --> 01:14:58,300
The entire city echoes in my street.

958
01:14:58,430 --> 01:15:02,870
In my street!

959
01:15:03,000 --> 01:15:05,090
If the cops come, we're in trouble
On my street.

960
01:15:05,220 --> 01:15:07,180
The best of life is on my street.

961
01:15:07,310 --> 01:15:09,100
My home sweet home on my street.

962
01:15:09,230 --> 01:15:12,720
It's tiny but our hearts are sweet.

963
01:15:12,850 --> 01:15:14,880
If you're in need
We're on our feet.

964
01:15:15,010 --> 01:15:17,220
We're poor Not thieves for sure.

965
01:15:17,350 --> 01:15:19,380
We've got our shops
But the games never stop.

966
01:15:19,510 --> 01:15:21,550
They say, "Loco won't give way
On the street"

967
01:15:21,680 --> 01:15:24,850
'Coz Loco's the way on our street.

968
01:15:24,980 --> 01:15:27,150
The vibe on my street is rocking.

969
01:15:27,280 --> 01:15:29,340
It's the pride of Dharavi.

970
01:15:29,470 --> 01:15:31,630
Money and fame are common.

971
01:15:31,760 --> 01:15:33,710
But our love's rare for everyone.

972
01:15:33,840 --> 01:15:35,990
My Rat Pack catches bugs on the tracks.

973
01:15:36,120 --> 01:15:38,220
When playing the fool we don't look back.

974
01:15:38,350 --> 01:15:40,430
We climb rooftops, con dudes.

975
01:15:40,560 --> 01:15:42,750
And pick a fight if we're in the mood.

976
01:15:42,880 --> 01:15:47,140
In my street!

977
01:15:47,270 --> 01:15:49,380
Your biggest dog is a poodle
On my street.

978
01:15:49,510 --> 01:15:51,670
The entire city echoes in my street.

979
01:15:51,800 --> 01:15:56,050
In my street!

980
01:15:56,180 --> 01:15:58,300
If the cops come, we're in trouble
On my street.

981
01:15:58,430 --> 01:16:00,510
The best of life is on my street.

982
01:16:00,760 --> 01:16:03,010
Shit goes wild when I bring my swag.

983
01:16:03,140 --> 01:16:05,220
Life gets money and the town gets stacked.

984
01:16:05,350 --> 01:16:07,470
Chick on your arm is eyeballing me.

985
01:16:07,600 --> 01:16:09,590
Your swag is a pile of baloney!

986
01:16:09,720 --> 01:16:11,840
I can defeat you in your own game.

987
01:16:11,970 --> 01:16:13,970
My bro's on my side, together we reign!

988
01:16:14,100 --> 01:16:16,380
Crush leaf, light toke, feel that, honey!

989
01:16:16,510 --> 01:16:18,370
If I slap you, go cryin' to mummy!

990
01:16:18,600 --> 01:16:21,720
Trouble is the street's tease.

991
01:16:21,850 --> 01:16:23,840
The broke one has everyone on their knees.

992
01:16:23,970 --> 01:16:25,970
Happiness is bae, she gets my way.

993
01:16:26,100 --> 01:16:28,260
The local swindler?
That's the minister!

994
01:16:28,390 --> 01:16:30,510
Who's big here?
We're all terriers!

995
01:16:30,640 --> 01:16:32,770
We hustle smooth and clear.

996
01:16:32,900 --> 01:16:36,180
When the cops come, the dogs disappear.

997
01:16:36,310 --> 01:16:40,460
In my street!

998
01:16:40,590 --> 01:16:42,760
Your biggest dog is a poodle
On my street.

999
01:16:42,890 --> 01:16:44,940
The entire city echoes in my street.

1000
01:16:45,070 --> 01:16:49,300
In my street!

1001
01:16:49,530 --> 01:16:51,580
If the cops come, we're in trouble
On my street.

1002
01:16:51,710 --> 01:16:53,890
The best of life is on my street.

1003
01:16:54,140 --> 01:16:56,220
In my street!

1004
01:16:56,350 --> 01:16:58,470
Your biggest dog is a poodle
On my street.

1005
01:16:58,600 --> 01:17:00,630
In my street!

1006
01:17:00,760 --> 01:17:02,850
If the cops come, we're in trouble
On my street.

1007
01:17:02,980 --> 01:17:05,100
In my street!

1008
01:17:05,230 --> 01:17:07,340
Your biggest dog is a poodle
On my street.

1009
01:17:07,470 --> 01:17:09,580
In my street!

1010
01:17:09,710 --> 01:17:11,720
The best of life is on my street.

1011
01:17:12,010 --> 01:17:13,570
On my street!

1012
01:17:21,940 --> 01:17:25,030
Even I watched the video
15 times, man. Seriously.

1013
01:17:25,160 --> 01:17:27,580
- Likes are pouring in.
- What are you saying. Let me see.

1014
01:17:27,710 --> 01:17:29,000
You've crossed 500 likes.

1015
01:17:29,130 --> 01:17:30,130
No way!

1016
01:17:30,170 --> 01:17:32,050
You're killing it, man!

1017
01:17:32,600 --> 01:17:33,820
Refresh it.

1018
01:17:34,650 --> 01:17:35,760
Look at that.

1019
01:17:36,680 --> 01:17:40,360
- It's up from 504 to 505.
- You're tearing it up, man!

1020
01:17:40,490 --> 01:17:41,780
Check the comments.

1021
01:17:42,080 --> 01:17:43,280
Did you get it?

1022
01:17:45,810 --> 01:17:47,030
What did that girl say?

1023
01:17:48,820 --> 01:17:50,960
Go straight to the garage,
don't mess around.

1024
01:17:54,310 --> 01:17:56,290
Moeen, you're using those kids
to deal drugs?

1025
01:17:56,720 --> 01:17:59,140
Chill. They had a message for me.

1026
01:17:59,270 --> 01:18:00,650
Shame on you, Moeen.

1027
01:18:03,540 --> 01:18:05,340
Tell me straight. What's going on?

1028
01:18:06,120 --> 01:18:07,130
Who the hell are you?

1029
01:18:08,560 --> 01:18:10,480
What have you ever achieved?

1030
01:18:11,780 --> 01:18:14,000
I don't like stupid questions.

1031
01:18:14,560 --> 01:18:16,720
I don't report to losers.

1032
01:18:18,090 --> 01:18:18,940
What happened?

1033
01:18:19,070 --> 01:18:21,830
He thinks he's a tough guy
because he's got a few likes.

1034
01:18:22,450 --> 01:18:25,530
- Is that you?
- No, it's my ghost, Ma.

1035
01:18:27,330 --> 01:18:28,400
What do you think?

1036
01:18:30,690 --> 01:18:33,310
Finish your studies first, get a job.
Then do all this.

1037
01:18:34,020 --> 01:18:36,900
Sure, Ma.
But did you like the video?

1038
01:18:39,020 --> 01:18:40,090
How did you do it?

1039
01:18:40,220 --> 01:18:42,270
I don't know, I just went with the flow.

1040
01:18:42,680 --> 01:18:44,860
They told me to do these
weird things...

1041
01:18:49,430 --> 01:18:50,510
Got to take the call.

1042
01:18:51,100 --> 01:18:52,180
So what?

1043
01:18:53,140 --> 01:18:54,270
Please go.

1044
01:18:56,380 --> 01:18:57,380
Hello?

1045
01:18:59,170 --> 01:19:00,170
Hi.

1046
01:19:01,100 --> 01:19:02,100
Yes.

1047
01:19:16,540 --> 01:19:17,620
Hello, love.

1048
01:19:18,010 --> 01:19:19,010
Hi.

1049
01:19:19,040 --> 01:19:21,080
Ankur, Murad. Maya, Murad.

1050
01:19:21,210 --> 01:19:22,560
Hi, what's up?

1051
01:19:22,690 --> 01:19:24,060
- Hi.
- Hi.

1052
01:19:26,590 --> 01:19:27,840
Where are we going?

1053
01:19:28,180 --> 01:19:29,410
Can you paint?

1054
01:19:30,030 --> 01:19:31,120
What do you mean?

1055
01:19:33,240 --> 01:19:37,360
The river has two shores.

1056
01:19:37,840 --> 01:19:41,770
I stand on one shore
My dream on the other.

1057
01:19:42,160 --> 01:19:46,240
My life is upside down

1058
01:19:46,370 --> 01:19:49,860
I'm lucky you're by my side.

1059
01:19:49,990 --> 01:19:53,230
Bringing a smile to my world.

1060
01:19:53,360 --> 01:19:55,370
- Wow!
- Nice!

1061
01:19:57,770 --> 01:20:00,740
I didn't know you were
interested in art.

1062
01:20:00,870 --> 01:20:02,960
This isn't art. This is war.

1063
01:20:03,090 --> 01:20:05,450
- All hail, Princess Sky!
- Shut up!

1064
01:20:12,060 --> 01:20:16,270
Dreams cannot be bought.

1065
01:20:16,580 --> 01:20:20,820
Borrowing dreams exacts a high price.

1066
01:20:21,100 --> 01:20:25,070
My life is upside down

1067
01:20:25,460 --> 01:20:28,570
I'm lucky you're by my side.

1068
01:20:28,980 --> 01:20:31,960
Bringing a smile to my world.

1069
01:20:35,520 --> 01:20:39,620
Since I met you I hear a song.

1070
01:20:40,030 --> 01:20:43,790
My silence has found a voice.

1071
01:20:44,450 --> 01:20:48,370
Like a flood of feeling filling the air.

1072
01:20:48,900 --> 01:20:51,780
Bringing a smile to my world.

1073
01:21:08,960 --> 01:21:11,690
Bringing a smile to my world.

1074
01:21:20,020 --> 01:21:23,920
Life isn't adding up.

1075
01:21:24,460 --> 01:21:28,270
A little gain, a little loss.

1076
01:21:28,800 --> 01:21:32,720
My life is upside down

1077
01:21:33,070 --> 01:21:36,190
I'm lucky you're by my side.

1078
01:21:37,160 --> 01:21:40,030
"Food. Clothes.
Shelter and Internet."

1079
01:22:00,340 --> 01:22:03,330
I can't believe I'm in a rap video.

1080
01:22:03,460 --> 01:22:06,860
I can't believe you were going
to do something else.

1081
01:22:08,860 --> 01:22:12,670
It's not that easy, madam.
You have to earn money.

1082
01:22:15,170 --> 01:22:18,010
Follow your passion, you will earn money.

1083
01:22:20,240 --> 01:22:21,360
Passion.

1084
01:22:22,190 --> 01:22:24,140
What's the Hindi word for passion?

1085
01:22:26,400 --> 01:22:28,840
Amazing! You live in India
and you can't speak Hindi.

1086
01:22:29,640 --> 01:22:31,210
I speak Hindi, OK?

1087
01:22:32,600 --> 01:22:34,540
I just don't know the word for passion.

1088
01:22:35,740 --> 01:22:37,770
The word is junoon.

1089
01:22:38,210 --> 01:22:39,610
Junoon.

1090
01:22:40,580 --> 01:22:42,230
I like it, I like the word.

1091
01:22:42,360 --> 01:22:45,520
You like it? Meets your approval?

1092
01:22:47,450 --> 01:22:48,450
Junoon.

1093
01:23:19,010 --> 01:23:19,810
Hello?

1094
01:23:19,940 --> 01:23:20,950
Where are you, Murad?

1095
01:23:21,250 --> 01:23:22,540
What time is it?

1096
01:23:22,670 --> 01:23:25,060
I've got permission for tomorrow.

1097
01:23:25,580 --> 01:23:26,580
For what?

1098
01:23:26,680 --> 01:23:29,380
The success part of your video.

1099
01:23:32,540 --> 01:23:33,760
Were you sleeping?

1100
01:23:34,030 --> 01:23:35,030
No.

1101
01:23:35,640 --> 01:23:37,060
Where were you last night?

1102
01:23:38,110 --> 01:23:40,410
Here, just around the corner.

1103
01:23:44,390 --> 01:23:45,390
Hello?

1104
01:23:46,710 --> 01:23:47,900
Are you coming now?

1105
01:23:48,310 --> 01:23:49,310
No.

1106
01:23:49,760 --> 01:23:51,350
Call me after college.

1107
01:23:52,500 --> 01:23:53,500
Bye.

1108
01:24:02,010 --> 01:24:02,900
How do I look?

1109
01:24:03,030 --> 01:24:07,450
You could be a model, man.
They like models who look starved.

1110
01:24:07,580 --> 01:24:09,740
These models are slim just like us.

1111
01:24:10,200 --> 01:24:12,570
- You got this in my size?
- Sure, what's your size?

1112
01:24:13,330 --> 01:24:17,420
Firstly, I let you in
and you're breaking things!

1113
01:24:30,410 --> 01:24:31,570
Sher!

1114
01:24:31,990 --> 01:24:34,020
What's up? Why are you shouting?

1115
01:24:34,550 --> 01:24:35,640
Bro...

1116
01:24:40,240 --> 01:24:42,840
- That's tight!
- Have you seen this?

1117
01:24:45,390 --> 01:24:48,710
Is Nas really coming here?
Why didn't you tell me?

1118
01:24:48,950 --> 01:24:52,020
Sorry. I forgot, man.
I found out only yesterday.

1119
01:24:52,150 --> 01:24:54,280
- How much is the ticket for?
- Read that.

1120
01:24:54,410 --> 01:24:55,720
What does it say?

1121
01:24:56,670 --> 01:24:57,870
Amazing news!

1122
01:24:58,000 --> 01:24:59,760
Will anyone tell me what's written there?

1123
01:24:59,890 --> 01:25:01,570
There's going to be
a rap battle in Mumbai.

1124
01:25:01,620 --> 01:25:04,270
- What?
- A rap competition.

1125
01:25:05,470 --> 01:25:09,260
The winner gets to perform
at Nas's concert.

1126
01:25:09,390 --> 01:25:10,680
The opening act!

1127
01:25:10,810 --> 01:25:12,630
A million rupees cash prize.

1128
01:25:12,760 --> 01:25:14,180
- A million?
- Yes.

1129
01:25:14,430 --> 01:25:16,480
No way! Get out of my way.

1130
01:25:16,860 --> 01:25:18,080
The prize is mine.

1131
01:25:18,210 --> 01:25:21,480
MC/BC Moeen is in the house!

1132
01:25:26,300 --> 01:25:27,580
This is how you do it, right?

1133
01:25:29,690 --> 01:25:32,010
Smoke weed every day!

1134
01:25:33,970 --> 01:25:35,450
He's so funny.

1135
01:25:36,680 --> 01:25:39,660
- What is this, bro?
- It's an opportunity, man.

1136
01:25:39,790 --> 01:25:41,650
I don't know how to battle.

1137
01:25:41,950 --> 01:25:42,990
Then learn.

1138
01:25:43,660 --> 01:25:46,230
- My counters aren't fast enough.
- Write them down then.

1139
01:25:53,360 --> 01:25:56,030
To "Mere Gully Mein." 300,000 views!

1140
01:25:56,160 --> 01:25:57,250
300,000!

1141
01:25:57,520 --> 01:25:58,890
You kidding me!

1142
01:26:04,810 --> 01:26:05,810
Wow!

1143
01:26:15,020 --> 01:26:16,180
Come outside.

1144
01:26:20,670 --> 01:26:22,050
Are you OK?

1145
01:26:23,420 --> 01:26:24,740
I'll be right back.

1146
01:26:27,820 --> 01:26:29,120
What did you tell your parents?

1147
01:26:29,510 --> 01:26:32,230
I said it is
Suhani's parents' anniversary party.

1148
01:26:32,510 --> 01:26:33,390
Clever.

1149
01:26:33,520 --> 01:26:35,750
With my friend Ankur.
He's an amazing artist.

1150
01:26:35,880 --> 01:26:37,990
Is that Murad?

1151
01:26:38,360 --> 01:26:39,360
Yeah.

1152
01:26:41,690 --> 01:26:42,540
What is that?

1153
01:26:42,670 --> 01:26:43,790
These guys... look at it.

1154
01:26:43,920 --> 01:26:46,080
These guys have been painting
the town red.

1155
01:26:46,410 --> 01:26:48,000
Graffiti all over town.

1156
01:26:50,160 --> 01:26:51,460
Isn't that crazy?

1157
01:26:52,330 --> 01:26:53,370
When was this?

1158
01:26:54,490 --> 01:26:55,490
Thursday.

1159
01:27:00,210 --> 01:27:02,460
- I'm just gonna go out for a smoke, yeah?
- Yeah.

1160
01:27:10,710 --> 01:27:12,240
Can I speak to you for a second?

1161
01:27:14,970 --> 01:27:17,520
Did you tell Safeena
we went out that night?

1162
01:27:18,100 --> 01:27:19,810
No, why? Did you?

1163
01:27:20,320 --> 01:27:22,070
I'm sorry, I didn't know.

1164
01:27:22,200 --> 01:27:23,460
Hey, octopus!

1165
01:27:24,400 --> 01:27:25,470
Get your hands off him.

1166
01:27:26,140 --> 01:27:27,910
Safeena, don't create a scene.

1167
01:27:29,890 --> 01:27:31,340
What's going on between you two?

1168
01:27:31,630 --> 01:27:32,690
Nothing.

1169
01:27:33,050 --> 01:27:35,420
We're friends, we connect on music.

1170
01:27:36,110 --> 01:27:38,910
So now you're connected to her?
You're a musician?

1171
01:27:39,040 --> 01:27:40,520
Do you want to talk in private?

1172
01:27:40,650 --> 01:27:42,730
No, tell me about this connection.

1173
01:27:42,860 --> 01:27:45,680
- He's very talented...
- Who's talking to you?

1174
01:27:48,160 --> 01:27:49,890
Were you with her on Thursday night?

1175
01:27:53,680 --> 01:27:56,420
- Yeah, I'm the one who...
- Will you be quiet?

1176
01:27:57,640 --> 01:27:58,640
Shut up!

1177
01:28:10,040 --> 01:28:12,000
You lied to me, Murad.

1178
01:28:17,010 --> 01:28:18,010
Murad?

1179
01:28:24,450 --> 01:28:25,570
This is my fault.

1180
01:28:26,090 --> 01:28:27,350
Safeena. Safeena.

1181
01:28:27,480 --> 01:28:28,480
Don't touch me.

1182
01:28:28,570 --> 01:28:30,340
No need to get physical,
calm down...

1183
01:28:30,470 --> 01:28:31,610
You want me to calm down?

1184
01:28:33,880 --> 01:28:35,130
Oh, my God!

1185
01:28:35,470 --> 01:28:37,480
Safeena, you're completely crazy!

1186
01:28:37,610 --> 01:28:39,030
Waiter, get some ice!

1187
01:28:39,160 --> 01:28:40,160
Slowly, don't touch!

1188
01:28:40,250 --> 01:28:41,910
Slow, slow...

1189
01:28:42,040 --> 01:28:43,250
Get some ice!

1190
01:28:43,600 --> 01:28:45,100
It was an assault, right?

1191
01:28:45,230 --> 01:28:48,660
Yes, ma'am. She hit me.
But she's my friend.

1192
01:28:49,160 --> 01:28:51,220
Do you want to file a case or not?

1193
01:28:51,350 --> 01:28:53,190
No, not at all.

1194
01:28:53,320 --> 01:28:54,130
Sure?

1195
01:28:54,260 --> 01:28:56,760
Yeah, I'm sure. It's a personal matter.

1196
01:28:57,080 --> 01:28:59,810
I can't take any action
if she won't file a case.

1197
01:29:03,240 --> 01:29:04,810
Sky isn't filing a complaint.

1198
01:29:06,140 --> 01:29:07,470
What he's saying is good.

1199
01:29:08,770 --> 01:29:10,030
Is my daughter here?

1200
01:29:10,670 --> 01:29:11,500
What's her name?

1201
01:29:11,630 --> 01:29:12,910
Safeena Firdausi.

1202
01:29:13,280 --> 01:29:14,530
Inside.

1203
01:29:20,350 --> 01:29:21,740
You lied to us?

1204
01:29:23,670 --> 01:29:25,010
Is this what we've taught you?

1205
01:29:28,980 --> 01:29:29,980
Then why did you do this?

1206
01:29:32,250 --> 01:29:35,450
If I tell you the truth,
you'll never let me leave the house.

1207
01:29:35,880 --> 01:29:38,590
So, is this our fault, too?

1208
01:29:38,720 --> 01:29:42,250
I didn't say that.
But did I have a choice?

1209
01:29:42,550 --> 01:29:46,870
If you don't lie and fight,
would your life be ruined?

1210
01:29:47,240 --> 01:29:48,790
It's already ruined, Ma.

1211
01:29:49,850 --> 01:29:53,210
My life is confined to college,
the clinic and home. What else do I do?

1212
01:29:55,620 --> 01:29:57,730
So what more do you want to do?

1213
01:29:59,310 --> 01:30:00,580
I want to go out.

1214
01:30:01,700 --> 01:30:03,680
Party with my friends,

1215
01:30:03,810 --> 01:30:07,050
watch movies, go to concerts,
wear lipstick.

1216
01:30:07,400 --> 01:30:10,720
Talk to boys.
Not secretly but in your presence.

1217
01:30:10,850 --> 01:30:13,670
I want to invite them home
like people do normally.

1218
01:30:14,050 --> 01:30:16,660
Suhani's parents let her
be the way she is.

1219
01:30:16,910 --> 01:30:21,210
Would you allow me to do these things?
If you agree, I'll never lie again.

1220
01:30:28,780 --> 01:30:32,050
Where did you get such ideas?
Just die!

1221
01:30:40,830 --> 01:30:41,830
Hello?

1222
01:30:42,170 --> 01:30:43,620
Hello. It's me.

1223
01:30:49,400 --> 01:30:50,460
Say something.

1224
01:30:50,670 --> 01:30:51,800
What should I say?

1225
01:30:53,920 --> 01:30:56,140
I'll apologize to her.

1226
01:31:00,370 --> 01:31:02,090
You could've blinded her.

1227
01:31:02,220 --> 01:31:03,570
I know. I lost it.

1228
01:31:04,380 --> 01:31:05,660
But you lied to me!

1229
01:31:05,790 --> 01:31:07,570
You said you were just around the corner.

1230
01:31:08,480 --> 01:31:11,750
Murad, I know there's something
between you two.

1231
01:31:11,880 --> 01:31:14,100
No, we just make music together.

1232
01:31:14,670 --> 01:31:18,400
Don't kid me. You're doing
much more than making music.

1233
01:31:18,530 --> 01:31:22,460
Oh, come on.
I can't handle this anymore.

1234
01:31:22,590 --> 01:31:26,250
First you lie.
Then you pretend it's my fault.

1235
01:31:30,960 --> 01:31:31,830
Talk to me!

1236
01:31:31,960 --> 01:31:32,980
What should I say?

1237
01:31:33,110 --> 01:31:34,176
What happened between you guys?

1238
01:31:34,200 --> 01:31:35,710
Nothing happened!

1239
01:31:35,840 --> 01:31:37,080
What's wrong with you?

1240
01:31:37,210 --> 01:31:38,470
What about you, Safeena?

1241
01:31:38,600 --> 01:31:42,300
You promised me you'd never
get violent again! Why did you beat her?

1242
01:31:42,430 --> 01:31:44,500
You could've been arrested!
Why don't you get it?

1243
01:31:44,630 --> 01:31:47,020
That's not the point!
We're talking about you!

1244
01:31:47,150 --> 01:31:50,210
Well, I'm tired
and I can't do this anymore!

1245
01:31:50,570 --> 01:31:52,570
What? What did you say?
What are you talking about?

1246
01:31:52,640 --> 01:31:53,460
This!

1247
01:31:53,590 --> 01:31:54,410
What are you talking about?

1248
01:31:54,540 --> 01:31:55,760
Whatever we have between us.

1249
01:31:58,170 --> 01:31:59,600
Tell me what you want!

1250
01:32:02,300 --> 01:32:03,300
Tell me!

1251
01:32:05,500 --> 01:32:06,580
I want some time.

1252
01:32:06,710 --> 01:32:09,130
Time? Do I look like a clock to you?

1253
01:32:09,260 --> 01:32:12,250
I want to focus on work,
not on your endless dramas.

1254
01:32:12,380 --> 01:32:15,500
- Dramas?
- Yes! I want to end it!

1255
01:32:16,340 --> 01:32:17,760
Don't call me again.

1256
01:32:21,440 --> 01:32:22,440
Hello?

1257
01:32:39,980 --> 01:32:41,700
She smashed a bottle on her head?

1258
01:32:48,500 --> 01:32:49,970
That's my girl!

1259
01:32:50,380 --> 01:32:52,750
Great, you're defending her.

1260
01:32:54,750 --> 01:32:56,460
It's not Safeena's fault.

1261
01:32:56,810 --> 01:32:58,310
It's my fault, man.

1262
01:32:59,140 --> 01:33:00,990
I messed up big time.

1263
01:33:01,880 --> 01:33:02,910
Bro.

1264
01:33:03,270 --> 01:33:06,030
Many would kill to mess up like you.

1265
01:33:07,180 --> 01:33:09,290
I don't know how to tell her.

1266
01:33:09,420 --> 01:33:12,830
She knows everything already, man.
She's no fool.

1267
01:33:12,960 --> 01:33:14,800
She keeps asking about it.

1268
01:33:16,760 --> 01:33:19,330
She's like her mom.
She'd kill me if I told her.

1269
01:33:20,890 --> 01:33:22,340
Will you ignore her for that?

1270
01:33:25,740 --> 01:33:26,960
You're such a coward.

1271
01:33:27,200 --> 01:33:28,550
Drop it.

1272
01:33:32,720 --> 01:33:34,540
She deserves to know the truth.

1273
01:33:36,400 --> 01:33:38,030
Just like I deserve

1274
01:33:38,710 --> 01:33:43,070
to be invited to the party with your
English-talking gang.

1275
01:33:47,010 --> 01:33:48,950
I see right through you, man.

1276
01:33:54,030 --> 01:33:56,750
He should've asked for Miss Shweta.

1277
01:33:56,880 --> 01:33:58,890
He kept asking for Sky.

1278
01:34:01,910 --> 01:34:02,910
Thanks.

1279
01:34:03,420 --> 01:34:05,990
You can go upstairs now.
I'll call you if I need anything.

1280
01:34:08,060 --> 01:34:09,440
You live here alone?

1281
01:34:10,050 --> 01:34:11,110
My parents live upstairs.

1282
01:34:11,240 --> 01:34:12,410
You have one more house?

1283
01:34:16,880 --> 01:34:18,570
Safeena texted me.

1284
01:34:19,150 --> 01:34:20,230
She apologized.

1285
01:34:22,300 --> 01:34:25,290
Did you ask her... to do that?

1286
01:34:28,160 --> 01:34:29,580
We broke up.

1287
01:34:34,460 --> 01:34:35,540
Are you OK?

1288
01:35:01,930 --> 01:35:07,990
I ask everyone from when to when
Were you drawn to me?

1289
01:35:10,830 --> 01:35:13,540
From when to when?

1290
01:35:13,670 --> 01:35:16,460
I keep wondering if I'm imagining things.

1291
01:35:16,590 --> 01:35:19,210
Or is it her words that quicken my heart?

1292
01:35:19,340 --> 01:35:22,290
I'm longing to tell you something.

1293
01:35:22,420 --> 01:35:24,250
If you like me, share my pain.

1294
01:35:24,380 --> 01:35:26,190
Make me.

1295
01:35:27,070 --> 01:35:29,060
Find.

1296
01:35:30,350 --> 01:35:34,100
Myself.

1297
01:35:36,570 --> 01:35:39,680
I ask everyone from when to when
Were you drawn to me?

1298
01:35:42,050 --> 01:35:44,760
Make me find myself.

1299
01:35:45,520 --> 01:35:48,290
From when to when?

1300
01:35:48,420 --> 01:35:51,180
The day we became friends.

1301
01:35:51,310 --> 01:35:53,870
The stars fell from the sky
To light my world.

1302
01:35:54,000 --> 01:35:57,090
What magic did you weave, O girl?

1303
01:35:57,220 --> 01:35:59,060
You're stealing my heart...

1304
01:36:09,790 --> 01:36:10,790
What?

1305
01:36:12,750 --> 01:36:14,730
I thought you liked me.

1306
01:36:19,630 --> 01:36:20,630
I like you.

1307
01:36:21,810 --> 01:36:23,040
So what's wrong?

1308
01:36:26,160 --> 01:36:27,940
Why are you interested in me?

1309
01:36:32,560 --> 01:36:33,630
Meaning?

1310
01:36:36,450 --> 01:36:38,250
You know where I'm from.

1311
01:36:38,750 --> 01:36:39,750
So?

1312
01:36:40,930 --> 01:36:42,030
You're an artist.

1313
01:36:43,100 --> 01:36:45,500
Where you're from, what you own...

1314
01:36:46,710 --> 01:36:47,960
None of that matters.

1315
01:36:53,810 --> 01:36:55,050
Is it Safeena?

1316
01:37:04,050 --> 01:37:06,000
Without Safeena,

1317
01:37:07,060 --> 01:37:08,590
my life would be like...

1318
01:37:10,910 --> 01:37:12,840
growing up without a childhood.

1319
01:37:19,410 --> 01:37:20,650
Should we finish the track?

1320
01:37:24,130 --> 01:37:25,130
Thank you.

1321
01:37:25,750 --> 01:37:27,730
You don't have to thank me.

1322
01:37:31,940 --> 01:37:34,920
- The bank is transferring him next year.
- Okay.

1323
01:37:35,050 --> 01:37:37,280
- To Delhi or Mauritius.
- Oh.

1324
01:37:37,660 --> 01:37:41,250
We want him to get married before that.

1325
01:37:41,790 --> 01:37:43,750
He may find it difficult
living alone there.

1326
01:37:46,000 --> 01:37:48,880
Safeena, can you cook?

1327
01:37:50,540 --> 01:37:54,200
No, but if all goes well,
I could transplant your liver one day.

1328
01:37:56,610 --> 01:37:59,670
She loves joking.
She wants to be a surgeon.

1329
01:37:59,800 --> 01:38:02,600
Be it studies or cooking. She's an expert!

1330
01:38:03,850 --> 01:38:05,020
Please, have some more.

1331
01:38:09,760 --> 01:38:11,290
When can I go back to college?

1332
01:38:11,860 --> 01:38:13,210
Get married first.

1333
01:38:15,330 --> 01:38:17,390
Dad? Dad.

1334
01:38:17,800 --> 01:38:19,500
It's just 18 months to go.

1335
01:38:19,630 --> 01:38:22,190
This is a crucial year.
I can't miss a single lecture.

1336
01:38:22,320 --> 01:38:24,630
There's no need for that, Safeena.

1337
01:38:25,430 --> 01:38:26,480
Dad?

1338
01:38:27,090 --> 01:38:28,510
Say something.

1339
01:38:28,640 --> 01:38:30,550
You know I'm a brilliant student.

1340
01:38:30,680 --> 01:38:33,020
You can't pull me out of college.
I've apologized.

1341
01:38:33,150 --> 01:38:34,570
Everyone is gossiping.

1342
01:38:34,700 --> 01:38:37,750
Dad, please! Please!

1343
01:38:39,560 --> 01:38:41,010
Dad, please.

1344
01:38:42,450 --> 01:38:46,830
Let me study. Please, Dad.
I want to study, Dad.

1345
01:38:46,960 --> 01:38:49,610
I'll marry anyone you want. Please.

1346
01:38:49,890 --> 01:38:50,690
Please.

1347
01:38:50,820 --> 01:38:52,890
I'll drop her at college
and pick her up every day.

1348
01:38:55,250 --> 01:38:57,230
But you'll have to meet suitors.

1349
01:38:58,370 --> 01:39:01,370
Forget everything else
and keep practicing your flow.

1350
01:39:01,500 --> 01:39:04,960
It's a battle, don't let anything
they say touch you.

1351
01:39:05,380 --> 01:39:06,540
Stay calm.

1352
01:39:06,670 --> 01:39:09,220
They'll insult you brutally
but don't let it stick.

1353
01:39:09,670 --> 01:39:12,390
Look them straight in the eye.

1354
01:39:12,610 --> 01:39:13,880
Wait and smile.

1355
01:39:14,010 --> 01:39:16,570
When it's your turn, destroy them.

1356
01:39:16,870 --> 01:39:17,870
Scan your opponent.

1357
01:39:17,940 --> 01:39:21,120
Even the toughest guys have
at least one weak spot.

1358
01:39:22,060 --> 01:39:24,050
Keep looking for that chink.

1359
01:39:24,180 --> 01:39:26,620
Find it. Tear it open
and grab your victory.

1360
01:39:26,970 --> 01:39:31,420
Rich guy, fat guy, ugly guy.
Daddy's boy, show-off, wannabe.

1361
01:39:31,550 --> 01:39:33,870
Use your standard rhyme when you can.

1362
01:39:34,230 --> 01:39:36,670
And keep practicing your flow.

1363
01:39:37,370 --> 01:39:39,520
You'll get the hang of it, yeah?

1364
01:39:42,680 --> 01:39:44,020
I'll kick him out!

1365
01:39:44,150 --> 01:39:45,710
The whole neighborhood knows

1366
01:39:45,840 --> 01:39:47,166
- and you didn't tell me.
- Everyone is looking!

1367
01:39:47,190 --> 01:39:49,850
- What do you mean?
- Where did he get the money from?

1368
01:39:49,980 --> 01:39:51,100
I didn't give him any money.

1369
01:39:51,180 --> 01:39:54,040
- He's a kid, you can't kick him out.
- Then how did he make a video?

1370
01:39:54,170 --> 01:39:55,040
What are you doing?

1371
01:39:55,170 --> 01:39:56,020
- You think he's a kid?
- Yes!

1372
01:39:56,150 --> 01:39:57,180
- A kid?
- Yes.

1373
01:39:57,310 --> 01:39:59,430
He's a burden on me and you say
he's a kid!

1374
01:39:59,560 --> 01:40:01,930
Let him be then. I'll look after him.

1375
01:40:02,060 --> 01:40:04,420
You look after your mistress.

1376
01:40:05,050 --> 01:40:06,130
What did you say?

1377
01:40:08,830 --> 01:40:09,920
Ungrateful wretch!

1378
01:40:10,050 --> 01:40:11,720
Thrash me! I won't keep quiet now!

1379
01:40:11,850 --> 01:40:12,670
It's your parents.

1380
01:40:12,800 --> 01:40:14,860
Yes! I will keep saying it!

1381
01:40:14,990 --> 01:40:16,396
- Go ahead, slap me!
- What did you say?

1382
01:40:16,420 --> 01:40:17,290
Dad!

1383
01:40:17,420 --> 01:40:19,290
Don't you dare hit her!

1384
01:40:19,420 --> 01:40:20,790
I'll call the police!

1385
01:40:20,920 --> 01:40:23,110
- Don't hit her!
- Murad!

1386
01:40:23,240 --> 01:40:24,600
Don't hit her!

1387
01:40:28,780 --> 01:40:30,480
You scoundrel!

1388
01:40:32,560 --> 01:40:34,860
- Hit me and I'll call the police!
- Don't hit her!

1389
01:40:34,990 --> 01:40:37,270
- Don't hit her!
- The police will thrash you!

1390
01:40:37,920 --> 01:40:40,360
The police will straighten you out.

1391
01:40:42,550 --> 01:40:43,920
Don't touch her.

1392
01:40:44,050 --> 01:40:45,130
Stop it, Murad.

1393
01:40:46,410 --> 01:40:48,590
Murad! Stop it, Murad!

1394
01:40:49,050 --> 01:40:50,050
Murad.

1395
01:40:50,660 --> 01:40:52,150
- He's your father.
- Murad.

1396
01:40:52,440 --> 01:40:54,770
Let go of him, Murad.

1397
01:40:57,320 --> 01:40:58,910
He's got some nerve.

1398
01:40:59,850 --> 01:41:01,210
Is this how you've raised him?

1399
01:41:01,340 --> 01:41:04,300
No wonder your husband brought home
a new wife.

1400
01:41:07,630 --> 01:41:09,720
Is this what you've taught him?

1401
01:41:09,850 --> 01:41:13,140
Let's go, Ma. We can't stay here.
You come too.

1402
01:41:13,590 --> 01:41:14,780
What are you all looking at?

1403
01:41:15,530 --> 01:41:16,630
Get lost from here!

1404
01:41:17,010 --> 01:41:20,800
Get out. Out!

1405
01:41:21,510 --> 01:41:22,730
All of you!

1406
01:41:33,640 --> 01:41:35,540
- Where's the van?
- I'll get it.

1407
01:41:48,890 --> 01:41:50,690
What about me?

1408
01:41:52,120 --> 01:41:53,850
Your son will look after you.

1409
01:41:54,240 --> 01:41:56,300
You've raised him so well.

1410
01:42:27,450 --> 01:42:29,390
This is part and parcel of marriage.

1411
01:42:31,870 --> 01:42:34,070
He doesn't have a problem
if you stay there, right?

1412
01:42:36,380 --> 01:42:37,830
Give it a few days.

1413
01:42:38,380 --> 01:42:39,660
Everything will be fine.

1414
01:42:39,790 --> 01:42:41,420
I don't want everything to be fine.

1415
01:42:43,750 --> 01:42:47,900
I just want some help to restart
my catering business.

1416
01:42:48,030 --> 01:42:50,480
You want to leave your husband
and want me to help you?

1417
01:42:50,610 --> 01:42:51,500
So you want...

1418
01:42:51,630 --> 01:42:54,490
Any man would get mad
if his own son behaved like he did!

1419
01:42:55,090 --> 01:42:56,090
Think about it!

1420
01:43:00,290 --> 01:43:02,180
Let's eat. Come on.

1421
01:43:14,520 --> 01:43:17,710
If you like singing, sing ballads.

1422
01:43:18,270 --> 01:43:19,990
Your uncle loves them.

1423
01:43:47,910 --> 01:43:49,710
What's up, Homie?

1424
01:43:50,710 --> 01:43:52,920
I told you to keep the kids away
from all this!

1425
01:43:54,000 --> 01:43:55,500
- Back off.
- They're kids, Moeen.

1426
01:43:55,630 --> 01:43:57,900
So what? You'll hit me?

1427
01:43:58,710 --> 01:44:00,290
I'll bury you here.

1428
01:44:01,790 --> 01:44:03,090
How dare you grab my collar!

1429
01:44:04,280 --> 01:44:07,170
Go grab the people
who left them in the gutter.

1430
01:44:07,580 --> 01:44:11,250
At least I give them food and shelter.
Don't lecture me.

1431
01:44:13,670 --> 01:44:14,670
Out.

1432
01:44:15,640 --> 01:44:16,840
Get out of here.

1433
01:44:26,170 --> 01:44:28,550
What are you looking at? Scram!

1434
01:44:33,100 --> 01:44:34,920
I won't say it again, Mustafa.

1435
01:44:50,530 --> 01:44:51,800
What's going on, bro?

1436
01:44:54,260 --> 01:44:55,930
I'm in big trouble.

1437
01:44:56,590 --> 01:44:59,130
Well, who isn't?

1438
01:45:01,660 --> 01:45:03,360
I need money.

1439
01:45:05,780 --> 01:45:07,340
My mother has nowhere to go.

1440
01:45:12,500 --> 01:45:15,550
I've got nothing saved up
to give you, Homie.

1441
01:45:16,710 --> 01:45:18,360
But we can work together.

1442
01:45:20,340 --> 01:45:21,440
Jack some cars.

1443
01:45:22,280 --> 01:45:24,590
You and me. My boss won't know.

1444
01:45:37,300 --> 01:45:38,520
Freedom!

1445
01:45:39,640 --> 01:45:41,000
Freedom!

1446
01:45:42,090 --> 01:45:43,310
Freedom!

1447
01:45:44,360 --> 01:45:45,520
Freedom!

1448
01:46:06,190 --> 01:46:08,590
Silence be damned
Justice is a sham.

1449
01:46:08,720 --> 01:46:11,050
Corruption runs in their veins
Intentions stained.

1450
01:46:11,180 --> 01:46:13,550
They speak of change
They're all the same.

1451
01:46:13,680 --> 01:46:16,250
They woo us for votes
Then jump the boat!

1452
01:46:16,380 --> 01:46:18,960
Money calls the shots.

1453
01:46:19,090 --> 01:46:21,420
Money is the boss.

1454
01:46:21,550 --> 01:46:23,750
It's not about merit
It's the sons who inherit.

1455
01:46:23,880 --> 01:46:26,370
They are safe in their yachts
As the country sinks.

1456
01:46:26,500 --> 01:46:28,790
You want education? Pay up!

1457
01:46:28,920 --> 01:46:31,290
Want drinking water? Line up!

1458
01:46:31,420 --> 01:46:36,000
They steal our land, our hope
Make us peddlers of their dope.

1459
01:46:36,130 --> 01:46:38,540
Why do you need four cars?

1460
01:46:38,670 --> 01:46:40,960
A palace for a family of four?

1461
01:46:41,090 --> 01:46:43,330
Do you care what we breathe?

1462
01:46:43,460 --> 01:46:45,780
Money doesn't replace nature.

1463
01:46:45,910 --> 01:46:47,970
Shh!

1464
01:46:48,300 --> 01:46:49,100
Don't silence me.

1465
01:46:49,230 --> 01:46:50,540
The scales are tilted.

1466
01:46:50,670 --> 01:46:51,550
Don't silence me.

1467
01:46:51,680 --> 01:46:53,000
Your laughter, my tears.

1468
01:46:53,130 --> 01:46:53,930
Don't silence me.

1469
01:46:54,060 --> 01:46:55,450
Why choke every day?

1470
01:46:55,580 --> 01:46:56,580
Don't silence me.

1471
01:46:56,630 --> 01:46:57,970
There'll come a Judgment Day.

1472
01:47:07,490 --> 01:47:10,590
I don't wanna be a slumdog millionaire
I'm on a mission.

1473
01:47:10,720 --> 01:47:13,280
The state's maggots feed on our graves.

1474
01:47:13,410 --> 01:47:15,700
A sword above our heads.

1475
01:47:15,830 --> 01:47:18,340
Screaming loud, rewriting history.

1476
01:47:18,730 --> 01:47:22,370
But who cares?
The devil works in the name of God.

1477
01:47:22,500 --> 01:47:24,800
Religion is used for money.

1478
01:47:24,930 --> 01:47:28,460
So think, listen, speak up.

1479
01:47:28,590 --> 01:47:30,920
Stop turning a blind eye!

1480
01:47:31,050 --> 01:47:33,370
Try some virtue
Honesty won't hurt you.

1481
01:47:33,500 --> 01:47:37,100
Clean this dirt! Clean this dirt!

1482
01:47:37,230 --> 01:47:38,120
Don't silence me.

1483
01:47:38,250 --> 01:47:39,540
The scales are tilted.

1484
01:47:39,670 --> 01:47:40,510
Don't silence me.

1485
01:47:40,640 --> 01:47:41,990
Your laughter, my tears.

1486
01:47:42,120 --> 01:47:42,960
Don't silence me.

1487
01:47:43,090 --> 01:47:44,440
Why choke every day?

1488
01:47:44,570 --> 01:47:45,570
Don't silence me.

1489
01:47:45,630 --> 01:47:47,480
There'll come a Judgment Day.

1490
01:47:49,130 --> 01:47:51,420
- Freedom!
- Freedom!

1491
01:47:51,550 --> 01:47:53,030
Freedom!

1492
01:47:53,160 --> 01:47:54,420
Give me freedom!

1493
01:47:54,900 --> 01:47:56,120
Have some meat.

1494
01:47:57,250 --> 01:47:59,250
Will I get anything to eat?

1495
01:48:01,310 --> 01:48:03,880
Are you a graduate?
Did you get a job?

1496
01:48:04,610 --> 01:48:06,230
Then I've got nothing for you.

1497
01:48:08,880 --> 01:48:09,880
Here.

1498
01:48:12,160 --> 01:48:13,800
When did you get so grown-up?

1499
01:48:18,940 --> 01:48:20,020
I'm studying.

1500
01:48:20,700 --> 01:48:22,860
You're lucky you get to choose.

1501
01:48:22,990 --> 01:48:24,250
Nobody even asked us.

1502
01:48:24,380 --> 01:48:27,920
I was told who to marry
and that was that.

1503
01:48:43,420 --> 01:48:44,820
He looks respectable.

1504
01:48:51,450 --> 01:48:53,670
A compressor is the heart
of any air-conditioner.

1505
01:48:53,800 --> 01:48:55,470
The role our heart plays in our body,

1506
01:48:55,600 --> 01:48:58,180
a compressor plays the same role
in any air-conditioner

1507
01:48:58,310 --> 01:48:59,590
or in any refrigeration system.

1508
01:48:59,720 --> 01:49:02,140
There's gas inside the tubing,
refrigerant gas.

1509
01:49:02,270 --> 01:49:04,290
The compressor compresses the gas, the air

1510
01:49:04,420 --> 01:49:06,670
and increases its pressure.

1511
01:49:06,800 --> 01:49:08,600
With this, the temperature also increases.

1512
01:49:10,620 --> 01:49:13,000
How I got here?
You don't wanna know.

1513
01:49:13,130 --> 01:49:15,630
Pain in my words
What else do I have to show?

1514
01:49:15,760 --> 01:49:18,040
My thoughts at the peak
My feet on the ground.

1515
01:49:18,170 --> 01:49:21,000
Don't believe me, but
Belief in me is what I found.

1516
01:49:21,130 --> 01:49:23,386
There are a million curses and
I have my mother's love every day.

1517
01:49:23,410 --> 01:49:26,280
Her smile is my victory
How could I lose my way?

1518
01:49:26,410 --> 01:49:28,560
Cut my tongue off
And my tears will sing aloud

1519
01:49:28,690 --> 01:49:31,490
Bury me, I'm a seed
I'll grow to touch a cloud.

1520
01:49:31,620 --> 01:49:33,700
When my heart broke
Hip-hop was all I had.

1521
01:49:33,830 --> 01:49:36,790
The night held me till morning
When things got really bad

1522
01:49:36,920 --> 01:49:38,960
I'm an artist and my tomorrow I shall make.

1523
01:49:39,090 --> 01:49:41,970
Art is my religion
And I have no other prayer to fake.

1524
01:49:42,100 --> 01:49:44,570
My mother, my universe
My lover, the street.

1525
01:49:44,700 --> 01:49:47,176
They call me crazy 'cause
My spirit is something they can't defeat.

1526
01:49:47,200 --> 01:49:49,670
Shout out and love to you
For lending me an ear

1527
01:49:49,800 --> 01:49:52,340
I make music, but I was made by those
Who held me dear.

1528
01:49:52,470 --> 01:49:54,660
Pay attention for I have only one goal.

1529
01:49:54,790 --> 01:49:57,440
That my words touch your heart
And calm your soul.

1530
01:49:57,570 --> 01:49:59,810
Make some noise!
Throw your hands up in the air!

1531
01:49:59,940 --> 01:50:02,640
Because India just met real hip-hop
And we ain't going nowhere!

1532
01:50:02,770 --> 01:50:05,000
Yes, sir, this beautiful dream
That we all share

1533
01:50:05,130 --> 01:50:07,910
India just met real hip-hop
And we ain't going nowhere!

1534
01:50:08,040 --> 01:50:10,190
Yes, sir, this beautiful dream
That we all share

1535
01:50:10,320 --> 01:50:12,980
India just met real hip-hop
And we ain't going nowhere!

1536
01:50:20,060 --> 01:50:21,060
Come in.

1537
01:50:22,440 --> 01:50:23,850
Can I have a word, Uncle?

1538
01:50:24,370 --> 01:50:25,410
Yes?

1539
01:50:26,220 --> 01:50:28,520
I have some work tomorrow.

1540
01:50:29,440 --> 01:50:31,050
I need to go somewhere.

1541
01:50:32,180 --> 01:50:33,900
Can I have the day off?

1542
01:50:34,350 --> 01:50:35,710
Where are you going on a picnic?

1543
01:50:37,610 --> 01:50:40,880
There's a contest I'm taking part in.
It's the first audition.

1544
01:50:41,760 --> 01:50:43,540
Where did you learn such fancy words?

1545
01:50:45,850 --> 01:50:48,020
Your father is a driver, remember?

1546
01:50:50,240 --> 01:50:52,830
A servant's son is a servant.
It's the law of nature.

1547
01:50:53,260 --> 01:50:57,900
But your mother is fighting
for you not to be a servant.

1548
01:50:58,820 --> 01:51:00,290
Keep that in mind.

1549
01:51:02,970 --> 01:51:04,180
The rest is up to god.

1550
01:51:40,820 --> 01:51:45,590
Just one path on which silently
Heads lowered, eyes closed.

1551
01:51:46,120 --> 01:51:48,070
People live out all their lives.

1552
01:51:48,850 --> 01:51:51,030
They don't know, they don't think.

1553
01:51:51,160 --> 01:51:52,200
They never ask.

1554
01:51:53,040 --> 01:51:55,330
Whether this path will
lead them somewhere.

1555
01:51:55,840 --> 01:51:57,050
Or nowhere at all.

1556
01:52:07,770 --> 01:52:10,150
Along the way a crossroad appears.

1557
01:52:10,520 --> 01:52:12,070
A path unlike the trodden path.

1558
01:52:13,300 --> 01:52:15,570
One that only the crazy tread.

1559
01:52:16,380 --> 01:52:19,990
Others forever walk the trodden path.

1560
01:52:21,170 --> 01:52:23,590
Heads lowered, eyes closed.

1561
01:52:23,720 --> 01:52:25,210
Haunted by the thought.

1562
01:52:26,750 --> 01:52:29,500
What if we had taken the path
less travelled?

1563
01:52:31,250 --> 01:52:33,350
Who knows where it might have led us.

1564
01:52:45,590 --> 01:52:46,890
Razia was right.

1565
01:52:47,570 --> 01:52:48,640
You're a smart boy.

1566
01:52:50,100 --> 01:52:51,100
Look at me.

1567
01:52:52,180 --> 01:52:54,240
Life gives everyone a chance.

1568
01:52:54,700 --> 01:52:56,060
Don't let it slip by.

1569
01:52:56,740 --> 01:52:58,850
You've secured your future today.

1570
01:53:22,220 --> 01:53:23,220
Uncle.

1571
01:53:24,050 --> 01:53:25,080
Thank you.

1572
01:53:39,790 --> 01:53:41,440
Yo, Homie, all good?
Where's your hood?

1573
01:53:41,570 --> 01:53:43,740
If you can rhyme, this is the right time.

1574
01:53:43,870 --> 01:53:45,530
Yo, Homie, all good?
Where's your hood?

1575
01:53:45,660 --> 01:53:47,880
If you can rhyme, this is the right time.

1576
01:53:49,710 --> 01:53:51,620
Yo, it's MC Altaf.

1577
01:53:51,980 --> 01:53:53,910
Dharavi was once a tiny slum.

1578
01:53:54,040 --> 01:53:55,820
Full of smartasses, I was one.

1579
01:53:55,950 --> 01:53:57,990
Don't mess with us, we're renegades.

1580
01:53:58,120 --> 01:53:59,730
Forget the future, think of your fate.

1581
01:53:59,860 --> 01:54:02,070
Guess what! A new era has dawned.

1582
01:54:02,200 --> 01:54:04,120
My words are magic
The pen is my wand.

1583
01:54:04,250 --> 01:54:05,870
My words and I, to this street we belong

1584
01:54:06,000 --> 01:54:08,120
I ain't poor, just hungry for a song.

1585
01:54:08,250 --> 01:54:09,950
Yo, Homie, all good?
Where's your hood?

1586
01:54:10,080 --> 01:54:12,250
If you can rhyme, this is the right time.

1587
01:54:24,540 --> 01:54:26,190
Yo, Homie, all good?
Where's your hood?

1588
01:54:26,320 --> 01:54:28,440
If you can rhyme, this is the right time.

1589
01:54:28,570 --> 01:54:30,270
Yo, Homie, all good?
Where's your hood?

1590
01:54:30,400 --> 01:54:32,580
If you can rhyme, this is the right time.

1591
01:54:36,780 --> 01:54:37,620
Bro!

1592
01:54:37,750 --> 01:54:38,750
Where have you been?

1593
01:54:42,900 --> 01:54:44,820
I thought I was too late.

1594
01:54:45,160 --> 01:54:46,210
Are you OK?

1595
01:54:46,620 --> 01:54:47,620
A bit nervous.

1596
01:54:47,700 --> 01:54:48,900
You won't be scared, will you?

1597
01:54:49,050 --> 01:54:50,760
I'll close my eyes and blurt it out.

1598
01:54:52,290 --> 01:54:53,290
Nice outfit.

1599
01:54:58,660 --> 01:55:00,210
That's your vibe, Homie!

1600
01:55:01,350 --> 01:55:03,080
All right, the all-important question.

1601
01:55:03,210 --> 01:55:07,600
Who will be our nation's
next rap star?

1602
01:55:07,730 --> 01:55:08,850
Yes!

1603
01:55:09,190 --> 01:55:12,590
All right, each contestant
will get one chance.

1604
01:55:12,720 --> 01:55:15,620
When your time is up

1605
01:55:15,750 --> 01:55:19,310
you'll hear the buzzer,
and the buzzer sounds like this.

1606
01:55:20,040 --> 01:55:21,600
- Cool?
- Yeah.

1607
01:55:21,730 --> 01:55:23,030
Shall we start the rap battles?

1608
01:55:23,160 --> 01:55:24,280
Yeah!

1609
01:55:26,130 --> 01:55:29,660
And our first contestant is...

1610
01:55:30,300 --> 01:55:33,710
He's here with a roar! MC Sher!

1611
01:55:33,840 --> 01:55:35,140
Whoa!

1612
01:55:38,460 --> 01:55:41,010
And up against him is

1613
01:55:41,140 --> 01:55:43,660
none other than Kaam Bhaari!

1614
01:55:46,350 --> 01:55:47,570
Kaam Bhaari!

1615
01:55:52,410 --> 01:55:55,760
And let the bottle decide
who goes first.

1616
01:55:57,240 --> 01:55:58,720
MC Sher!

1617
01:55:58,850 --> 01:56:01,530
Show the shorty his place!

1618
01:56:01,660 --> 01:56:06,040
Oh, now I know why cursing
In the rap battle is banned.

1619
01:56:06,770 --> 01:56:09,240
It's 'cause kids like him
Are sitting in the stand.

1620
01:56:10,700 --> 01:56:11,700
- Killer!
- Roast him!

1621
01:56:11,830 --> 01:56:14,410
You act like a wise guy
But you're a fool.

1622
01:56:14,680 --> 01:56:16,660
Get out of here!
You should be in school.

1623
01:56:18,130 --> 01:56:21,570
Beating kids is bad
But face it, I'm your wicked dad.

1624
01:56:21,700 --> 01:56:24,720
You think you're Goliath but
You must've lost the heels you had

1625
01:56:25,730 --> 01:56:27,700
I'll chew you up, spit you out.

1626
01:56:27,830 --> 01:56:29,780
Roast you till you shout

1627
01:56:29,910 --> 01:56:32,730
I'm big money, you're small change, honey

1628
01:56:33,090 --> 01:56:35,930
I'm the jungle king, you're a puny thing.

1629
01:56:37,060 --> 01:56:39,200
Sorry, I hurt you
Didn't mean to make you sad.

1630
01:56:39,330 --> 01:56:41,910
You're just a kid
Who doesn't even know his dad.

1631
01:56:43,900 --> 01:56:48,820
You're no lion, you're a giraffe
I'm on the hunt.

1632
01:56:48,950 --> 01:56:52,530
You can dance your "bhangra"
But you'll get shot on the front.

1633
01:56:52,970 --> 01:56:55,880
Your drunk dad
Should open your head like his bottle.

1634
01:56:56,230 --> 01:56:59,030
Stick his tongue in and chug full throttle.

1635
01:56:59,410 --> 01:57:04,380
Listen up, Sher
I've got a sharp cutter

1636
01:57:04,770 --> 01:57:08,350
I'll use it like Murad is bread
And you're butter.

1637
01:57:09,190 --> 01:57:12,530
My tunes are bangers, yours don't fly.

1638
01:57:12,660 --> 01:57:16,260
You look like a burger
But you're actually a fry.

1639
01:57:17,930 --> 01:57:20,910
My words explode like a gunpowder drum

1640
01:57:21,040 --> 01:57:23,450
I can get into your head
Like a shot of rum.

1641
01:57:23,580 --> 01:57:26,490
Rum reminds me!
Tell your dad I said hi.

1642
01:57:26,620 --> 01:57:29,060
My name is Kaam Bhaari
Goodnight and goodbye.

1643
01:57:34,790 --> 01:57:36,270
So you want to open a clinic?

1644
01:57:37,070 --> 01:57:38,170
Maybe.

1645
01:57:38,640 --> 01:57:42,210
I'll have responsibilities at home,
so maybe I'll work part-time.

1646
01:57:43,640 --> 01:57:45,240
Nice to hear that.

1647
01:57:45,370 --> 01:57:49,330
Girls these days forget their homes
in favor of their careers.

1648
01:57:49,630 --> 01:57:50,920
So true.

1649
01:57:51,700 --> 01:57:53,370
I know my priorities.

1650
01:58:00,410 --> 01:58:04,510
Salman wants to talk to Safeena
in private, if you don't mind.

1651
01:58:04,640 --> 01:58:06,020
No, not at all.

1652
01:58:07,660 --> 01:58:08,660
Thank you.

1653
01:58:18,910 --> 01:58:20,310
What a nightmare!

1654
01:58:20,830 --> 01:58:22,320
My parents insisted so I...

1655
01:58:22,450 --> 01:58:23,650
Does Murad know?

1656
01:58:23,780 --> 01:58:26,460
Not yet, but he'll crack up
when he finds out.

1657
01:58:26,850 --> 01:58:28,560
Do you want to reject first
or should I?

1658
01:58:28,980 --> 01:58:30,300
I'm going to say yes.

1659
01:58:33,760 --> 01:58:36,520
Ask Murad to call me

1660
01:58:37,230 --> 01:58:39,930
or I will marry you, Salman.

1661
01:58:51,620 --> 01:58:53,740
Before we kick this thing off
I have a doubt.

1662
01:58:53,870 --> 01:58:57,330
There should only be rappers here
Who let the dogs out?

1663
01:58:57,580 --> 01:58:59,470
I don't bark, I go straight to the bite

1664
01:58:59,600 --> 01:59:02,410
I'll chop you into mincemeat
In plain sight.

1665
01:59:03,790 --> 01:59:06,350
Stop preening, let me pass

1666
01:59:06,480 --> 01:59:08,920
I'm like Tyson, way above your class.

1667
01:59:09,160 --> 01:59:11,070
You're that water gun that's dry on Holi.

1668
01:59:11,200 --> 01:59:15,090
Hitting you for a sixer like MS Dhoni

1669
01:59:15,580 --> 01:59:18,130
I'll stand right here and hit a four.

1670
01:59:18,260 --> 01:59:20,730
You keep on running to make up the score

1671
01:59:20,860 --> 01:59:24,160
I'm the hunter, you're a lamb
Frail and afraid.

1672
01:59:24,290 --> 01:59:28,030
If you're Dope Daddy
I'm a narcotics raid.

1673
01:59:30,070 --> 01:59:32,120
You wanna battle?

1674
01:59:32,250 --> 01:59:34,740
Make yourself like me.

1675
01:59:34,870 --> 01:59:37,160
Or just hit the road and beg for a penny.

1676
01:59:37,290 --> 01:59:38,700
Scram!

1677
01:59:38,830 --> 01:59:39,860
You dare diss me?

1678
01:59:39,990 --> 01:59:42,120
I am paid for teaching scums like you.

1679
01:59:42,250 --> 01:59:45,190
If I say no, you're down on your knees.

1680
01:59:45,650 --> 01:59:48,200
I always bite, you growl and bark.

1681
01:59:48,330 --> 01:59:50,900
You're a fish in a tank
I'm a great white shark.

1682
01:59:53,580 --> 01:59:56,030
Next up in the rap battle is...

1683
01:59:56,160 --> 01:59:57,670
Shah Rule!

1684
02:00:00,050 --> 02:00:01,770
And fighting him will be.

1685
02:00:02,320 --> 02:00:03,690
Gully Boy!

1686
02:00:08,520 --> 02:00:11,080
Come on up here, Gully Boy.

1687
02:00:11,840 --> 02:00:14,810
Yo, Shah Rule, make him choke!
Again!

1688
02:00:17,540 --> 02:00:19,980
Gully Boy, Shah Rule,
pick up your mics.

1689
02:00:20,590 --> 02:00:22,950
And let the bottle decide
who goes first.

1690
02:00:25,340 --> 02:00:28,640
And it's Shah Rule!

1691
02:00:31,430 --> 02:00:35,800
The rap game isn't your thing
Come wash my car

1692
02:00:36,030 --> 02:00:40,100
I'll throw you a coin
You'll feel like a star.

1693
02:00:40,460 --> 02:00:44,600
You're a 9-to-5 dog
Stumbling in the streets.

1694
02:00:44,730 --> 02:00:49,520
Tailing your Master Sher
Singing to his beats.

1695
02:00:51,410 --> 02:00:55,370
Wow, your clothes look great
Dripping with sweat.

1696
02:00:55,500 --> 02:00:59,320
A nobody, a street rat
Your life is under threat.

1697
02:00:59,450 --> 02:01:03,160
Run and catch the local train
To your street.

1698
02:01:03,290 --> 02:01:07,000
You slave of the system
Grovel at your boss's feet.

1699
02:01:07,950 --> 02:01:12,070
Your thoughts are trash
You were raised in a bin.

1700
02:01:12,200 --> 02:01:16,430
The moment I saw you
I knew lightweights can't win.

1701
02:01:16,780 --> 02:01:21,170
Follow me, I'm your guru
I can make you better.

1702
02:01:21,460 --> 02:01:26,110
Buy your mum a sari
Take this coin, you beggar.

1703
02:01:28,360 --> 02:01:30,880
Yeah! Kill him boy!

1704
02:01:31,370 --> 02:01:32,530
That's right!

1705
02:01:52,300 --> 02:01:54,290
What's that, Gully Boy?
A heart attack?

1706
02:02:08,160 --> 02:02:11,880
Wow, that was tight
Now must I dance to your tune?

1707
02:02:14,500 --> 02:02:18,840
I've shed sweat and blood
Now you'll shed tears soon.

1708
02:02:20,990 --> 02:02:24,330
I keep repeating my clothes
'Cause I only have a few.

1709
02:02:24,460 --> 02:02:28,430
But each time I wear this shirt
I know I look cool.

1710
02:02:30,740 --> 02:02:35,210
Bow down! Take a knee!
Tuck your tail in and run.

1711
02:02:35,340 --> 02:02:38,910
'Cause I buy my own shirts
While your father still pays for his son.

1712
02:02:40,890 --> 02:02:45,020
Keep your fancy cars
I'll be fine on my feet.

1713
02:02:45,150 --> 02:02:48,990
'Cause you have less sense
Than the saris my mother needs.

1714
02:02:51,840 --> 02:02:56,050
You hear that? Listen closely
That applause is for me!

1715
02:03:03,000 --> 02:03:08,440
Your life's been a free pass
Never had to pay back the loan.

1716
02:03:10,220 --> 02:03:15,430
From Murad to Gully Boy
I've worked myself to the bone.

1717
02:03:15,770 --> 02:03:17,930
Gully Boy!

1718
02:03:18,060 --> 02:03:19,060
Awesome, man!

1719
02:03:19,350 --> 02:03:23,810
I'm gonna break every scale
You can't measure me.

1720
02:03:23,940 --> 02:03:29,080
Your easy money got raided, bro
And now my coin will speak.

1721
02:03:36,450 --> 02:03:38,930
That was hard! Very hard!

1722
02:03:44,620 --> 02:03:47,450
What an amazing semi-final
that was!

1723
02:03:48,210 --> 02:03:52,910
Here are the top ten rappers
the audience voted for.

1724
02:03:53,040 --> 02:03:58,790
Now let's ask our judges
for their decision.

1725
02:03:59,240 --> 02:04:02,210
I'm gonna say five names,
please step forward.

1726
02:04:02,950 --> 02:04:04,030
MC Todfod.

1727
02:04:05,690 --> 02:04:06,880
Malik Sahab.

1728
02:04:09,110 --> 02:04:10,380
MC Sher.

1729
02:04:12,300 --> 02:04:14,030
Stony Psyko.

1730
02:04:15,710 --> 02:04:16,960
Shaikhspeare.

1731
02:04:25,300 --> 02:04:26,720
OK, hold up!

1732
02:04:27,580 --> 02:04:31,490
OK, guys, you were all very good.

1733
02:04:31,760 --> 02:04:34,670
But you could've been better.

1734
02:04:37,930 --> 02:04:40,320
Your journey ends here.
I'm sorry, guys.

1735
02:04:41,240 --> 02:04:44,690
Good luck to you all.
Keep rapping and keep the scene alive.

1736
02:04:46,270 --> 02:04:49,380
So, congratulations to our finalists!

1737
02:04:49,940 --> 02:04:51,580
Emiway Bantai.

1738
02:04:52,330 --> 02:04:54,110
MC Checkmate.

1739
02:04:54,410 --> 02:04:55,790
Dee MC.

1740
02:04:56,220 --> 02:04:57,710
Kaam Bhaari.

1741
02:04:58,220 --> 02:04:59,500
Gully Boy.

1742
02:04:59,630 --> 02:05:03,290
Get ready and give it up
for our five contenders

1743
02:05:03,540 --> 02:05:07,930
who'll perform solo
on 11 May at the finals!

1744
02:05:13,250 --> 02:05:14,870
Greetings, my man.

1745
02:05:15,160 --> 02:05:16,260
Homie!

1746
02:05:16,550 --> 02:05:18,030
I heard you killed it yesterday!

1747
02:05:18,160 --> 02:05:20,210
- Yeah, it was fantastic.
- I know.

1748
02:05:20,340 --> 02:05:21,340
How?

1749
02:05:21,470 --> 02:05:23,650
Rishi saw it on Facebook.

1750
02:05:23,780 --> 02:05:24,950
Really?

1751
02:05:25,080 --> 02:05:26,550
- Yes!
- It was killer, man.

1752
02:05:29,430 --> 02:05:30,660
It was a hard scene.

1753
02:05:30,790 --> 02:05:31,810
Tell me more.

1754
02:05:33,850 --> 02:05:35,460
I lost my job though.

1755
02:05:35,990 --> 02:05:37,010
Are you serious?

1756
02:05:37,320 --> 02:05:39,540
I left office to attend
the competition.

1757
02:05:41,700 --> 02:05:45,670
Do you have any work for me?
I can do it till I find a better job.

1758
02:05:47,500 --> 02:05:49,300
Do you think the work I do
is not good enough?

1759
02:05:50,570 --> 02:05:52,450
That's not what I meant, man.

1760
02:05:56,580 --> 02:05:58,760
Crack open the bonnet.

1761
02:05:58,890 --> 02:06:01,380
- Right now?
- Waiting for the stars to align?

1762
02:06:06,250 --> 02:06:07,270
Yo, Homie.

1763
02:06:07,620 --> 02:06:09,980
What's up, my man?
What brings you here?

1764
02:06:14,010 --> 02:06:15,010
Speak up.

1765
02:06:16,170 --> 02:06:17,360
I need to talk to you.

1766
02:06:17,770 --> 02:06:19,200
Go ahead. Why are you so tensed up?

1767
02:06:20,620 --> 02:06:21,750
Let's talk over there.

1768
02:06:23,520 --> 02:06:25,700
You can talk in his presence. Go ahead.

1769
02:06:26,880 --> 02:06:28,150
I met Safeena.

1770
02:06:30,200 --> 02:06:31,200
Where?

1771
02:06:32,460 --> 02:06:34,180
My parents took me to her place.

1772
02:06:35,370 --> 02:06:36,370
Why?

1773
02:06:38,200 --> 02:06:41,600
I told you they're looking
for a girl for me.

1774
02:06:42,920 --> 02:06:44,530
Have you lost it?

1775
02:06:44,660 --> 02:06:46,560
- You want me to thrash you?
- Cool, cool.

1776
02:06:46,690 --> 02:06:48,630
Come on, man.
Obviously, I refused.

1777
02:06:50,210 --> 02:06:52,530
But she told me if you didn't call her,

1778
02:06:52,660 --> 02:06:56,490
she'll force my parents
to get us married.

1779
02:06:58,280 --> 02:07:00,570
Call her. You know how crazy she is.

1780
02:07:00,700 --> 02:07:02,350
I don't want to marry her.

1781
02:07:17,580 --> 02:07:19,920
- She's my girl!
- Just call her, man!

1782
02:07:32,450 --> 02:07:33,460
Hello?

1783
02:07:33,790 --> 02:07:35,150
Open the window of your bathroom.

1784
02:07:36,120 --> 02:07:36,960
Why, what happened?

1785
02:07:37,090 --> 02:07:38,880
Just do as I say.

1786
02:07:39,320 --> 02:07:40,320
One minute.

1787
02:07:56,660 --> 02:07:57,770
Murad!

1788
02:07:59,030 --> 02:08:00,340
What are you doing?

1789
02:08:00,950 --> 02:08:02,580
Careful.

1790
02:08:14,720 --> 02:08:16,180
You really are crazy.

1791
02:08:17,560 --> 02:08:20,530
What do you care
if I'm crazy or hazy?

1792
02:08:22,070 --> 02:08:23,200
I miss you.

1793
02:08:24,250 --> 02:08:25,250
Say it again.

1794
02:08:25,790 --> 02:08:27,690
I miss you.

1795
02:08:30,520 --> 02:08:32,570
Then why didn't you call?

1796
02:08:57,730 --> 02:08:59,120
So is the break-up over?

1797
02:09:00,540 --> 02:09:01,620
Yes.

1798
02:09:02,090 --> 02:09:04,960
And what about Yo Yo Sky?

1799
02:09:07,240 --> 02:09:09,240
Nothing, she's just a friend.

1800
02:09:10,480 --> 02:09:11,480
But?

1801
02:09:14,040 --> 02:09:15,850
But we hooked up once.

1802
02:09:16,260 --> 02:09:19,420
It wasn't serious.
It didn't mean anything.

1803
02:09:19,850 --> 02:09:21,840
It always means something.

1804
02:09:24,980 --> 02:09:25,980
Sorry.

1805
02:09:26,340 --> 02:09:29,610
Now I get to hook up
with someone too.

1806
02:09:29,940 --> 02:09:31,540
If that's cool with you, we'll talk.

1807
02:09:36,620 --> 02:09:38,550
You do whatever you like.

1808
02:09:39,020 --> 02:09:40,020
Settled?

1809
02:09:40,290 --> 02:09:41,320
Yes.

1810
02:09:59,120 --> 02:10:00,620
What's with your parents?

1811
02:10:01,170 --> 02:10:02,940
Why are they pushing you to marry?

1812
02:10:03,410 --> 02:10:05,200
They can't do a thing.
I'll deal with it.

1813
02:10:05,850 --> 02:10:08,590
You know, I cleared the semi-finals.

1814
02:10:09,350 --> 02:10:10,850
I made it to the finals!

1815
02:10:11,170 --> 02:10:12,450
- Rap battle?
- Yes.

1816
02:10:12,580 --> 02:10:13,960
- No way!
- Yes!

1817
02:10:14,430 --> 02:10:18,990
The winner gets a million rupees.
A million!

1818
02:10:23,880 --> 02:10:26,290
I don't know if I'll win or not.

1819
02:10:28,320 --> 02:10:30,160
But this is what I want to do.

1820
02:10:33,940 --> 02:10:35,830
You do whatever you like.

1821
02:10:36,790 --> 02:10:38,280
I'm going to be a surgeon.

1822
02:10:39,320 --> 02:10:40,670
We'll have a good life.

1823
02:10:51,420 --> 02:10:52,440
Ma!

1824
02:10:57,440 --> 02:10:58,460
What is he doing here?

1825
02:10:58,590 --> 02:11:00,520
Where were you all day?

1826
02:11:01,520 --> 02:11:03,900
I called you so many times,
why didn't you answer?

1827
02:11:04,380 --> 02:11:06,620
I even sent Suhail to find you.

1828
02:11:12,760 --> 02:11:14,950
Ateeq said you walked out
of the office.

1829
02:11:15,080 --> 02:11:16,150
Yes, I did.

1830
02:11:19,690 --> 02:11:20,830
Are you high?

1831
02:11:23,130 --> 02:11:24,440
I got selected.

1832
02:11:26,600 --> 02:11:29,460
Over 50 rappers took part,
only five were selected.

1833
02:11:29,590 --> 02:11:30,800
I'm one of them.

1834
02:11:32,470 --> 02:11:34,120
I made the right choice.

1835
02:11:34,570 --> 02:11:35,730
Choice?

1836
02:11:36,200 --> 02:11:38,540
Who are you? What are you worth?

1837
02:11:39,040 --> 02:11:40,260
Let it be.

1838
02:11:40,520 --> 02:11:42,630
Call Ateeq and apologize...

1839
02:11:42,760 --> 02:11:45,110
I won't call him, he called us servants.

1840
02:11:45,240 --> 02:11:46,840
But we are servants.

1841
02:11:47,110 --> 02:11:50,420
That means we serve
and work hard.

1842
02:11:50,550 --> 02:11:52,490
We aren't slaves.

1843
02:11:52,810 --> 02:11:54,990
Whatever we are,
we deserve respect.

1844
02:11:55,120 --> 02:11:57,250
You won't get such an opportunity again!

1845
02:11:58,600 --> 02:11:59,600
We...

1846
02:12:00,140 --> 02:12:02,260
Who do you think you are?

1847
02:12:02,610 --> 02:12:04,810
Who the hell is someone else
to tell me who I am?

1848
02:12:08,400 --> 02:12:09,400
Look at this.

1849
02:12:10,990 --> 02:12:11,990
Look.

1850
02:12:13,610 --> 02:12:16,170
Over 400,000 people saw this video.

1851
02:12:16,910 --> 02:12:17,910
So what?

1852
02:12:18,890 --> 02:12:22,430
Read the comments they've posted.
They're thanking me

1853
02:12:22,770 --> 02:12:26,090
for making a song about people like us.

1854
02:12:26,380 --> 02:12:27,380
So what?

1855
02:12:27,450 --> 02:12:29,220
So it means something!

1856
02:12:31,090 --> 02:12:32,900
It matters to people.

1857
02:12:33,590 --> 02:12:36,760
After I die, people will still watch it
and feel something.

1858
02:12:36,890 --> 02:12:39,200
That has value. I have value.

1859
02:12:41,180 --> 02:12:43,210
Don't ever call me worthless.

1860
02:12:45,800 --> 02:12:46,930
I am something.

1861
02:12:47,830 --> 02:12:49,470
And I'm worth something.

1862
02:12:53,720 --> 02:12:56,550
These songs will get you nowhere.

1863
02:12:56,680 --> 02:12:58,600
You'll never get it.

1864
02:12:58,860 --> 02:13:00,590
I've wasted money on his education.

1865
02:13:00,720 --> 02:13:02,670
I'll pay you back.

1866
02:13:02,800 --> 02:13:03,900
How?

1867
02:13:15,660 --> 02:13:16,710
Listen, son.

1868
02:13:18,140 --> 02:13:20,850
Life isn't easy for people like us.

1869
02:13:21,630 --> 02:13:23,770
We can't afford big dreams.

1870
02:13:24,200 --> 02:13:27,700
Haven't I told you to keep
your head down? The world...

1871
02:13:27,830 --> 02:13:31,520
Did you ever consider
you might be wrong?

1872
02:13:32,480 --> 02:13:35,910
That you've wasted your whole life
believing a lie?

1873
02:13:36,460 --> 02:13:37,980
Believing this is our fate

1874
02:13:38,260 --> 02:13:40,370
and we lie in the scraps!

1875
02:13:40,760 --> 02:13:41,760
No.

1876
02:13:43,270 --> 02:13:44,670
It's not a lie.

1877
02:13:47,380 --> 02:13:49,840
I've seen more sunsets
than you have.

1878
02:13:50,430 --> 02:13:53,130
I've taught you only what I've learned.

1879
02:13:54,590 --> 02:13:57,590
Your dream must match your reality.

1880
02:13:57,720 --> 02:14:02,010
I will not change my dream
to match my reality.

1881
02:14:04,300 --> 02:14:08,990
I will change my reality...
to match my dream.

1882
02:14:11,650 --> 02:14:13,820
God has given me a gift.

1883
02:14:15,040 --> 02:14:16,610
I won't give it back.

1884
02:14:19,900 --> 02:14:21,170
I've made my decision.

1885
02:14:27,220 --> 02:14:28,480
That's it.

1886
02:14:33,360 --> 02:14:34,680
Hey, come on, move!

1887
02:14:37,970 --> 02:14:39,770
Come on! Move it!

1888
02:14:39,900 --> 02:14:42,780
Sir, I've not stolen any car. I haven't.

1889
02:14:46,160 --> 02:14:48,510
- I haven't stolen the car.
- Move it!

1890
02:14:48,640 --> 02:14:50,740
- Who are the others?
- I'm just a mechanic!

1891
02:14:50,870 --> 02:14:52,050
What was your plan?

1892
02:14:52,180 --> 02:14:54,950
- Listen to me...
- Get inside!

1893
02:14:55,080 --> 02:14:57,410
- Please listen...
- You must be put behind bars!

1894
02:14:57,540 --> 02:15:00,270
We saw you on CCTV.
What's your name?

1895
02:15:16,890 --> 02:15:18,290
Fuck, it hurts!

1896
02:15:19,840 --> 02:15:20,920
Five minutes.

1897
02:15:26,490 --> 02:15:27,490
How are you?

1898
02:15:28,450 --> 02:15:31,150
Don't ask, man.
These guys really roughed me up.

1899
02:15:33,040 --> 02:15:35,800
But I didn't tell them anything.

1900
02:15:36,760 --> 02:15:39,610
Don't worry, I'll tell them it was me.

1901
02:15:40,880 --> 02:15:43,100
Are you crazy? Come here.

1902
02:15:45,570 --> 02:15:46,650
Why would you say anything?

1903
02:15:47,520 --> 02:15:49,340
Think about your bail, bro.

1904
02:15:50,410 --> 02:15:52,700
My testimony can get you out of here.

1905
02:15:54,410 --> 02:15:55,410
I'll tell them.

1906
02:15:55,520 --> 02:15:58,370
Don't. Get it?

1907
02:15:59,040 --> 02:16:02,330
You were there when I needed help.
How can I abandon you now?

1908
02:16:02,660 --> 02:16:06,990
I would've ended up in here
one way or another. Do you get it?

1909
02:16:09,150 --> 02:16:12,980
This is my life, man.
Surviving on the edge. Somehow.

1910
02:16:15,180 --> 02:16:17,390
Good things are coming your way.

1911
02:16:18,680 --> 02:16:19,770
Don't risk it.

1912
02:16:24,090 --> 02:16:28,910
You can post my bail once
you win the contest, man.

1913
02:16:30,970 --> 02:16:32,100
I'm sorry, bro.

1914
02:16:35,460 --> 02:16:37,130
Feed my kids.

1915
02:16:38,680 --> 02:16:40,260
Take care of them.

1916
02:16:41,930 --> 02:16:45,260
Make everyone from Dharavi 17 proud.

1917
02:16:45,830 --> 02:16:46,890
You hear me?

1918
02:16:48,690 --> 02:16:52,100
Go there and wipe them clean.
Then come and save Moeen.

1919
02:16:54,170 --> 02:16:55,820
That was like a rap, Homie!

1920
02:17:41,240 --> 02:17:43,030
- Hi, bro.
- Good luck, man.

1921
02:17:43,160 --> 02:17:45,230
What's up, Sher?

1922
02:17:48,600 --> 02:17:50,360
Not necessary, please go ahead.

1923
02:17:51,210 --> 02:17:52,310
Wow!

1924
02:17:54,030 --> 02:17:55,130
Your name, ma'am?

1925
02:18:28,620 --> 02:18:30,020
How are you feeling?

1926
02:18:30,150 --> 02:18:31,180
I'm terrified.

1927
02:18:31,310 --> 02:18:33,430
What are you talking about?
You're gonna kill it.

1928
02:18:33,560 --> 02:18:35,370
Go, get out there!

1929
02:18:35,780 --> 02:18:36,920
Just go.

1930
02:18:39,600 --> 02:18:43,100
- Bro, look who's here!
- Hey!

1931
02:18:47,680 --> 02:18:49,880
Relax, champion, you're ready now.

1932
02:18:51,770 --> 02:18:53,510
You're the real king of the jungle.

1933
02:18:53,640 --> 02:18:56,950
What a guy! Are you going to cry now?

1934
02:18:57,250 --> 02:18:58,280
Are you going to cry?

1935
02:18:58,740 --> 02:19:01,330
Excuse me, we need you
in the contestant section, please.

1936
02:19:01,460 --> 02:19:02,540
- There?
- Yeah.

1937
02:19:05,260 --> 02:19:06,710
Killing it!

1938
02:19:07,680 --> 02:19:08,830
Go for it, man.

1939
02:19:09,850 --> 02:19:10,990
Gully Boy!

1940
02:19:17,680 --> 02:19:20,330
- Where to?
- Just following her.

1941
02:19:23,690 --> 02:19:26,100
Right here. Cordon that.

1942
02:20:29,530 --> 02:20:31,440
What's going on, public?

1943
02:20:32,110 --> 02:20:34,010
What did you think of Emiway Bantai?

1944
02:20:34,140 --> 02:20:36,250
Superb! Awesome!

1945
02:20:37,620 --> 02:20:41,070
Our underground movement
will now spread worldwide!

1946
02:20:42,430 --> 02:20:44,210
Keep this fire burning.

1947
02:20:44,340 --> 02:20:46,670
When I say hip-hop, you say forever.

1948
02:20:46,800 --> 02:20:48,400
- Hip-Hop.
- Forever!

1949
02:20:48,530 --> 02:20:50,140
- Hip-Hop.
- Forever!

1950
02:20:55,130 --> 02:20:56,330
Awesome!

1951
02:20:57,530 --> 02:20:59,860
Are you ready for the next contestant?

1952
02:21:01,530 --> 02:21:04,250
Shall we get him on stage?

1953
02:21:06,410 --> 02:21:08,630
And you Mumbai folk will decide

1954
02:21:08,760 --> 02:21:11,390
who'll open for the legendary Nas!

1955
02:21:13,750 --> 02:21:15,900
Presenting the next contestant

1956
02:21:16,340 --> 02:21:17,620
from Dharavi 17,

1957
02:21:17,930 --> 02:21:21,350
Murad Ahmed aka Gully Boy!

1958
02:21:21,940 --> 02:21:23,630
Gully Boy!

1959
02:21:25,450 --> 02:21:27,030
Make some noise, public!

1960
02:21:29,050 --> 02:21:30,410
Louder!

1961
02:21:31,280 --> 02:21:33,140
Louder!

1962
02:21:34,890 --> 02:21:36,320
What's up, my man?

1963
02:21:37,220 --> 02:21:38,420
I'm a bit nervous.

1964
02:21:38,550 --> 02:21:39,610
Good luck!

1965
02:21:39,740 --> 02:21:41,830
- Thanks you. Respect.
- Gully Boy!

1966
02:21:41,960 --> 02:21:45,070
Gully Boy! Gully Boy! Gully Boy!

1967
02:21:52,010 --> 02:21:53,080
Wow!

1968
02:21:55,150 --> 02:22:00,050
I've never performed on stage
in front of a crowd like this.

1969
02:22:01,460 --> 02:22:05,170
I thought a lot about
what I should perform today.

1970
02:22:05,300 --> 02:22:09,530
Then I decided it'll be
the first song I ever wrote.

1971
02:22:10,880 --> 02:22:16,510
I wrote this at a time
when everything was going wrong.

1972
02:22:18,060 --> 02:22:20,160
Then something inside me said:

1973
02:22:22,310 --> 02:22:23,970
"No matter how rough things are,

1974
02:22:24,700 --> 02:22:28,180
believe in yourself. You're tougher
than you know, Homie."

1975
02:22:28,560 --> 02:22:30,160
That's hard!

1976
02:22:33,710 --> 02:22:35,210
Music gave me a voice.

1977
02:22:35,340 --> 02:22:38,240
And I think if you have a voice,
you should raise it.

1978
02:22:38,370 --> 02:22:39,850
Yeah!

1979
02:22:42,140 --> 02:22:43,800
That's my boy!

1980
02:22:46,140 --> 02:22:47,270
Listen, public.

1981
02:22:50,580 --> 02:22:52,590
Gully Boy!

1982
02:23:00,010 --> 02:23:01,390
Gully Boy!

1983
02:23:05,920 --> 02:23:08,330
Who said I won't make it?

1984
02:23:11,930 --> 02:23:13,420
Who said it?

1985
02:23:16,960 --> 02:23:18,090
My time will come!

1986
02:23:18,220 --> 02:23:20,570
Rise like a phoenix from the ashes!

1987
02:23:20,700 --> 02:23:23,100
As your wings spread
The sky will bow to you.

1988
02:23:23,230 --> 02:23:25,090
Our time will come!

1989
02:23:25,220 --> 02:23:27,340
No one is as smooth a hustler as me.

1990
02:23:27,470 --> 02:23:30,010
The lava of my words will melt my shackles.

1991
02:23:30,140 --> 02:23:32,550
You will reap as you shall sow.

1992
02:23:32,680 --> 02:23:35,130
My dreams will make fear tremble.

1993
02:23:35,260 --> 02:23:38,090
You can't bury dreams six-feet-under.

1994
02:23:38,220 --> 02:23:40,520
No fear, only guts!

1995
02:23:40,650 --> 02:23:43,210
We'll storm ahead, we'll seize the day.

1996
02:23:43,340 --> 02:23:45,640
Blood and sweat gave our life meaning.

1997
02:23:45,960 --> 02:23:48,340
Why? 'Cause our time will come!

1998
02:23:48,470 --> 02:23:51,060
Born to earth naked
You'll go with nothing.

1999
02:23:52,330 --> 02:23:53,580
Our time will come!

2000
02:23:54,850 --> 02:23:56,110
Our time will come!

2001
02:23:57,300 --> 02:23:58,300
Our time will come!

2002
02:23:58,380 --> 02:24:01,300
Born to earth naked
You'll go with nothing.

2003
02:24:02,480 --> 02:24:03,750
Our time will come!

2004
02:24:04,960 --> 02:24:06,220
Our time will come!

2005
02:24:07,550 --> 02:24:10,730
Born to earth naked
You'll go with nothing.

2006
02:24:10,860 --> 02:24:13,950
No one opened doors
I kicked my way in.

2007
02:24:14,080 --> 02:24:16,370
When luck turned, blessings rained on me.

2008
02:24:16,500 --> 02:24:18,710
The boy is a rebel, fierce and fearless.

2009
02:24:18,840 --> 02:24:21,040
He needs choice, heart, power.

2010
02:24:21,170 --> 02:24:23,670
Conflict, audacity, faith.

2011
02:24:23,800 --> 02:24:27,210
Love and loyalty for victory.

2012
02:24:27,340 --> 02:24:31,430
He doesn't need fame
No one is as hard as him.

2013
02:24:32,460 --> 02:24:34,730
Fortune favors the fearless, why?

2014
02:24:36,840 --> 02:24:38,220
Bravo, Murad!

2015
02:24:38,680 --> 02:24:39,960
'Cause our time will come!

2016
02:24:40,090 --> 02:24:42,770
Born to earth naked
You'll go with nothing.

2017
02:24:44,080 --> 02:24:45,480
Our time will come!

2018
02:24:46,560 --> 02:24:48,010
Our time will come!

2019
02:24:49,000 --> 02:24:50,000
Our time will come!

2020
02:24:50,130 --> 02:24:52,840
Born to earth naked
You'll go with nothing.

2021
02:24:54,160 --> 02:24:55,470
Our time will come!

2022
02:24:56,540 --> 02:24:58,040
Our time will come!

2023
02:24:59,060 --> 02:25:00,200
Our time will come!

2024
02:25:00,330 --> 02:25:02,960
Born to earth naked
You'll go with nothing.

2025
02:25:03,910 --> 02:25:05,610
Born to earth naked.

2026
02:25:06,460 --> 02:25:08,110
With nothing you'll go.

2027
02:25:09,210 --> 02:25:10,720
Our time will come!

2028
02:25:11,760 --> 02:25:13,470
Our time will come!

2029
02:25:14,170 --> 02:25:16,170
Our time will come!

2030
02:25:16,590 --> 02:25:18,410
You will go with nothing.

2031
02:25:18,540 --> 02:25:21,210
Gully Boy! Gully Boy! Gully Boy!

2032
02:25:30,700 --> 02:25:32,250
The rap star of India.

2033
02:25:35,530 --> 02:25:37,130
The rap star of India.

2034
02:29:43,280 --> 02:29:48,060
What's up, public?

2035
02:29:53,910 --> 02:29:55,490
Let's do this.
