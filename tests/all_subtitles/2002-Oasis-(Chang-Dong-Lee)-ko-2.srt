Sir, can I borrow a cigarette?

18
00:03:35,319 --> 00:03:37,617
Sir, a light, too?

19
00:03:52,303 --> 00:03:55,500
The bus for Hagye goes from here?

20
00:03:55,573 --> 00:03:56,437
I don't know

21
00:03:57,341 --> 00:03:58,239
You don't know?

22
00:04:17,828 --> 00:04:20,319
Take a look...
I'll give you a discount

23
00:04:30,107 --> 00:04:31,597
How much is this?

24
00:04:54,131 --> 00:04:54,825
Who is it?

25
00:04:55,533 --> 00:04:56,864
Laundry!

26
00:04:57,234 --> 00:04:57,962
Who?

27
00:04:58,536 --> 00:05:01,027
Laundry!

28
00:05:12,416 --> 00:05:14,281
Doesn't Hong Jong-II live here?

29
00:05:15,252 --> 00:05:16,514
No one of that name here!

30
00:05:16,820 --> 00:05:17,479
Pardon?

31
00:05:17,988 --> 00:05:19,683
No one of that name here!

32
00:05:20,124 --> 00:05:21,250
Did they move?

33
00:05:22,927 --> 00:05:26,021
When, uh, did you move in?

34
00:06:05,502 --> 00:06:07,367
Ma'am, do you have tofu?

35
00:06:07,705 --> 00:06:09,468
Tofu? I'm afraid not

36
00:06:09,807 --> 00:06:13,675
It's freezing!
What's so fun on TV?

37
00:06:15,412 --> 00:06:16,572
What about raw tofu?

38
00:06:17,047 --> 00:06:17,843
No, I don't

39
00:06:18,115 --> 00:06:18,843
No?

40
00:06:42,706 --> 00:06:43,866
How much?

41
00:06:44,608 --> 00:06:45,632
It's on the house

42
00:06:46,276 --> 00:06:46,799
Pardon?

43
00:06:47,211 --> 00:06:48,838
You can have it for free,
enjoy yourself

44
00:06:57,054 --> 00:07:00,148
Take your time... have some milk

45
00:07:06,230 --> 00:07:07,356
Don't you have Haitai milk?

46
00:07:08,332 --> 00:07:11,358
What's so special about Haitai?
They're all the same

47
00:07:12,436 --> 00:07:13,903
"When it comes to milk, choose Haitai! "

48
00:07:14,171 --> 00:07:15,468
Whatever...

49
00:07:25,849 --> 00:07:29,148
- Hello? It's me, Ji-Hyun
- And Min-Hee

50
00:07:29,219 --> 00:07:31,244
Don't mind her

51
00:07:31,388 --> 00:07:33,822
I'm with Min-Hee by the school gate

52
00:07:35,959 --> 00:07:38,257
Of course I'm playing hokey!

53
00:07:41,832 --> 00:07:42,992
She's going to the Click-B concert

54
00:07:43,500 --> 00:07:46,936
Come on, we can ditch Min-Hee...

55
00:07:48,806 --> 00:07:51,001
Hey, I have to make a call...

56
00:07:51,575 --> 00:07:52,872
But, I don't have any coins

57
00:07:53,310 --> 00:07:54,971
Can you lend me some coins?

58
00:07:57,281 --> 00:07:59,044
I'll call you back later

59
00:08:16,066 --> 00:08:19,194
Please wait a bit longer
As soon as I get through...

60
00:08:22,406 --> 00:08:24,067
Leave the table as it is!

61
00:08:24,308 --> 00:08:26,367
Trust me, I won't run away!

62
00:08:29,947 --> 00:08:31,346
I'll leave my shoes here

63
00:08:31,849 --> 00:08:34,317
I can't run away barefoot, right?

64
00:08:35,452 --> 00:08:41,823
My younger brother will come over
as soon as I get him on the phone

65
00:08:42,092 --> 00:08:45,653
And when will that be?
You've made over ten calls already!

66
00:08:46,330 --> 00:08:47,524
Explain it to the cops!

67
00:08:48,298 --> 00:08:53,634
Sir, I'd really prefer not to do that,
for personal reasons...

68
00:08:55,472 --> 00:08:57,599
Here, take my shoes

69
00:08:59,276 --> 00:09:01,403
I promise I won't run away

70
00:09:01,645 --> 00:09:02,703
Scared of the cops?

71
00:09:02,780 --> 00:09:05,510
And you order food
when you're broke?

72
00:09:05,849 --> 00:09:07,339
I thought I could
get him on the phone...

73
00:09:13,957 --> 00:09:15,948
Officers, thanks for your trouble

74
00:09:16,760 --> 00:09:17,954
Grab him!

75
00:09:24,201 --> 00:09:25,225
That hurts!

76
00:09:29,873 --> 00:09:32,034
- Stay still!
- That really hurts!

77
00:09:42,052 --> 00:09:43,849
This is his record

78
00:09:45,389 --> 00:09:46,981
He's only just been released,

79
00:09:48,659 --> 00:09:50,456
Bastard's in the shit already!

80
00:09:50,861 --> 00:09:51,828
Hong Jong-Du!

81
00:09:52,162 --> 00:09:52,958
Yes, sir!

82
00:09:53,564 --> 00:09:55,862
Three convictions, right?

83
00:09:56,934 --> 00:09:57,866
Right

84
00:09:58,602 --> 00:10:00,263
One for assault

85
00:10:00,370 --> 00:10:01,997
One for attempted rape

86
00:10:03,774 --> 00:10:05,503
And the last for involuntary
manslaughter?

87
00:10:06,844 --> 00:10:07,936
You killed someone?

88
00:10:09,079 --> 00:10:12,845
Oh, that... I was driving at dawn

89
00:10:14,585 --> 00:10:20,490
It was dark and I didn't see
one of those sanitation workers

90
00:10:20,958 --> 00:10:22,220
- You didn't see him?
- Right

91
00:10:22,292 --> 00:10:23,316
How long did you serve?

92
00:10:23,927 --> 00:10:25,485
Two and a half years

93
00:10:26,530 --> 00:10:28,327
Then it must've been
a hit-and-run case

94
00:10:28,999 --> 00:10:29,761
Yep

95
00:10:30,234 --> 00:10:31,861
No one ever come to visit you in jail?

96
00:10:32,369 --> 00:10:33,768
What's with your stupid summer shirt?

97
00:10:34,738 --> 00:10:36,638
You got out today

98
00:10:37,040 --> 00:10:39,941
You should've gone home
to see your family

99
00:10:42,546 --> 00:10:48,485
Instead you wandered around broke,
and try to eat without paying

100
00:10:50,454 --> 00:10:53,946
The thing is, my family moved

101
00:10:54,625 --> 00:10:56,286
Changed the phone number, too

102
00:10:57,060 --> 00:11:00,496
If I could've reached them,
of course I would've paid

103
00:11:01,765 --> 00:11:06,429
My brother's office used to be
right by that restaurant

104
00:11:06,670 --> 00:11:10,606
When I let you use the phone,
you didn't even know the number

105
00:11:11,108 --> 00:11:14,805
You shouldn't have set foot in the
restaurant in the first place

106
00:11:15,345 --> 00:11:16,937
Don't you know it's a crime
to eat without paying?

107
00:11:17,014 --> 00:11:18,242
Of course, I do

108
00:11:20,851 --> 00:11:22,250
Hong Jong-Sae!

109
00:11:24,655 --> 00:11:27,647
Over here! Come on!

110
00:11:29,660 --> 00:11:31,491
Hurry, it's okay

111
00:11:33,864 --> 00:11:34,523
Say hello

112
00:11:34,831 --> 00:11:35,798
He's my younger brother

113
00:11:35,933 --> 00:11:36,991
Good evening, officers

114
00:11:37,768 --> 00:11:40,601
Come on, grab a chair

115
00:11:40,837 --> 00:11:42,361
- Are you his younger brother?
- Yes, I am

116
00:11:42,739 --> 00:11:44,502
Hey, did you dye your hair?

117
00:11:45,742 --> 00:11:47,710
It doesn't suit you at all

118
00:11:48,445 --> 00:11:50,845
- A friend of his?
- No, his brother

119
00:11:53,650 --> 00:11:57,381
Feels fucking great!

120
00:11:58,789 --> 00:12:01,485
Stop it! I'm closing
the window, it's too cold

121
00:12:11,768 --> 00:12:12,700
Stop it!

122
00:12:13,503 --> 00:12:14,333
Are you angry?

123
00:12:15,472 --> 00:12:16,996
I'm not angry

124
00:12:20,043 --> 00:12:21,476
I said stop it

125
00:12:22,679 --> 00:12:24,374
You're angry, huh?

126
00:12:28,385 --> 00:12:30,148
You're angry with me, right?

127
00:12:38,428 --> 00:12:44,799
Jong-Du, as a favor,
please don't disrupt my life, okay?

128
00:12:45,769 --> 00:12:46,736
Please

129
00:13:16,733 --> 00:13:17,665
Darling!

130
00:13:20,604 --> 00:13:21,969
I'm home!

131
00:13:22,039 --> 00:13:23,267
What the hell are you wearing?

132
00:13:23,807 --> 00:13:28,244
They sent you out like this
in the middle of winter?

133
00:13:28,945 --> 00:13:32,278
It's because it was summer
when I went in

134
00:13:32,849 --> 00:13:37,149
Ma, why is the place so shabby?

135
00:13:39,089 --> 00:13:40,556
Since your brother was laid off...

136
00:13:40,624 --> 00:13:43,957
He had to sell the apartment
to run a new business

137
00:13:44,194 --> 00:13:45,627
Don't say anything!

138
00:13:46,329 --> 00:13:47,421
Which is his room? This one?

139
00:13:47,964 --> 00:13:50,660
Everybody, I'm back!

140
00:13:50,867 --> 00:13:55,099
Jong-Du!
When did you get out?

141
00:13:55,338 --> 00:13:57,306
Where's Jung-Min? Asleep?

142
00:13:57,741 --> 00:13:58,537
Yes, don't wake him

143
00:13:58,842 --> 00:14:02,278
But he hasn't seen me in ages!

144
00:14:02,345 --> 00:14:04,711
My god, what is this? Jong-Du!

145
00:14:05,882 --> 00:14:08,214
Hurry! Hurry!

146
00:14:08,351 --> 00:14:09,579
Go wash your feet!

147
00:14:09,820 --> 00:14:12,983
You see this mess on the floor?

148
00:14:14,391 --> 00:14:15,323
Have you been in
a rice-paddy or something?

149
00:14:15,525 --> 00:14:18,119
- Have you eaten?
- Yes

150
00:14:23,934 --> 00:14:27,768
Please lift the toilet seat!

151
00:14:28,772 --> 00:14:30,000
Stop standing around and sit

152
00:14:30,373 --> 00:14:31,840
It's late, I should be going

153
00:14:32,042 --> 00:14:34,101
How did you find him
to bring him here?

154
00:14:34,945 --> 00:14:35,673
Don't ask!

155
00:14:36,480 --> 00:14:37,708
Where are we going to put him?

156
00:14:37,881 --> 00:14:43,820
Ma, I got you a present

157
00:14:45,255 --> 00:14:47,052
You think you've been abroad
or something?

158
00:14:47,390 --> 00:14:48,550
Here, try it on

159
00:14:48,825 --> 00:14:50,087
I'll try it on later

160
00:14:50,193 --> 00:14:51,455
No, do it now

161
00:14:51,795 --> 00:14:55,390
I told the guy I'd change it
if it doesn't fit

162
00:14:56,032 --> 00:14:58,660
Sister-in-law, I'll buy you an
even better one later

163
00:14:58,902 --> 00:15:00,665
Forget it!

164
00:15:02,906 --> 00:15:06,933
Wow, Mrs Hong, you're a knockout!

165
00:15:12,782 --> 00:15:14,113
How's business?

166
00:15:17,020 --> 00:15:18,112
You quit?

167
00:15:18,755 --> 00:15:20,689
Let's have a drink tonight!

168
00:15:20,790 --> 00:15:21,814
It's been a while

169
00:15:26,496 --> 00:15:30,091
You're busy?
You said you quit

170
00:15:32,035 --> 00:15:37,405
Okay, Okay... I'm hanging up,
you bastard!

171
00:15:42,345 --> 00:15:44,905
"The number you dialed
is no longer in service"

172
00:15:45,015 --> 00:15:46,539
Sit down for a moment

173
00:15:54,324 --> 00:15:55,882
It's about time you grew up

174
00:16:00,330 --> 00:16:02,195
Do you know what that means?

175
00:16:04,534 --> 00:16:11,030
Being an adult means you can't
just do whatever you like

176
00:16:15,312 --> 00:16:17,075
You have to be responsible
for your actions

177
00:16:18,281 --> 00:16:22,012
You have to fit in with society,
be aware of how others see you

178
00:16:24,020 --> 00:16:26,989
That's what being
an adult is all about

179
00:16:29,593 --> 00:16:30,582
Stop shaking your leg!

180
00:16:34,798 --> 00:16:35,696
How old is he?

181
00:16:36,533 --> 00:16:37,727
Just turned 28

182
00:16:38,568 --> 00:16:39,125
29

183
00:16:41,238 --> 00:16:42,466
He'll be 29 after the new year

184
00:16:43,440 --> 00:16:44,668
That's when I turn 30

185
00:16:46,443 --> 00:16:47,876
Isn't 29 a bit old to deliver food?

186
00:16:48,845 --> 00:16:51,313
His age doesn't matter,
he has to start somewhere

187
00:16:51,681 --> 00:16:53,205
He has no special skills...

188
00:16:53,950 --> 00:16:56,612
Well, it'll be useful experience

189
00:16:57,854 --> 00:17:00,948
Good preparation
for other kinds of work

190
00:17:05,195 --> 00:17:07,925
If you want to learn,
there's a lot to learn

191
00:17:08,698 --> 00:17:14,000
Even by delivering food on a motorcycle,
you meet all sorts of people...

192
00:17:14,104 --> 00:17:15,264
When do I start?

193
00:17:16,373 --> 00:17:18,273
He hasn't finished yet

194
00:17:20,777 --> 00:17:21,937
You're always do that

195
00:17:23,446 --> 00:17:26,745
Let people finish first,
and then talk

196
00:17:27,484 --> 00:17:28,678
What's your rush?

197
00:17:31,788 --> 00:17:35,121
Try to listen and understand till the end

198
00:17:35,659 --> 00:17:37,388
Then you speak next

199
00:17:38,662 --> 00:17:40,323
If you want, you can start today

200
00:17:41,998 --> 00:17:45,161
How about tomorrow?
I got somewhere to go today

201
00:17:49,372 --> 00:17:50,100
I know...

202
00:18:05,155 --> 00:18:05,780
Miss...

203
00:18:06,690 --> 00:18:11,423
Excuse me, is that the Euijungbu
Citizens' Apartment Building?

204
00:18:34,417 --> 00:18:36,647
Careful, that's fragile!

205
00:18:36,920 --> 00:18:37,386
Okay

206
00:19:19,896 --> 00:19:21,363
Hello!

207
00:19:28,972 --> 00:19:31,133
Does Han Sang-Shik live here?

208
00:19:39,482 --> 00:19:40,915
Are you moving out today?

209
00:19:45,221 --> 00:19:46,518
You must be the daughter

210
00:20:12,882 --> 00:20:14,042
Can you talk?

211
00:20:23,426 --> 00:20:24,620
What's your name?

212
00:20:30,400 --> 00:20:31,424
What are you doing?

213
00:20:33,837 --> 00:20:34,667
How do you do?

214
00:20:34,838 --> 00:20:36,066
You must be moving out today?

215
00:20:36,573 --> 00:20:37,597
What can I do for you?

216
00:20:38,241 --> 00:20:40,402
You don't remember me?
We've met before...

217
00:20:41,811 --> 00:20:43,642
You must have bad memory

218
00:20:44,113 --> 00:20:47,947
t was two-and-a-half years ago,
at the police station

219
00:20:48,284 --> 00:20:50,445
After your father
died in a traffic accident...

220
00:20:51,688 --> 00:20:52,586
Why are you here?

221
00:20:52,989 --> 00:20:54,047
I just came to say hello

222
00:20:54,390 --> 00:20:56,381
I wondered how you were all doing

223
00:20:57,193 --> 00:20:58,751
You know, I got out of prison
the other day

224
00:20:58,828 --> 00:21:02,423
I wanted to come yesterday,
but I wasn't sure about the address

225
00:21:02,532 --> 00:21:03,260
Get out of here! Now!

226
00:21:03,733 --> 00:21:05,257
We don't need your greetings,
so leave

227
00:21:06,769 --> 00:21:08,896
What's going on? Who is this?

228
00:21:09,005 --> 00:21:10,472
No need to get mad

229
00:21:10,974 --> 00:21:12,271
I just came by to say hello

230
00:21:12,642 --> 00:21:18,103
What makes you think anyone wants
your greetings? Get out now!

231
00:21:19,282 --> 00:21:20,180
Get the hell out!

232
00:21:20,483 --> 00:21:21,814
Alright, I'm leaving! But...

233
00:21:22,318 --> 00:21:23,148
And take this with you!

234
00:21:28,157 --> 00:21:29,146
Good luck on your move!

235
00:21:29,692 --> 00:21:31,626
Must be going to a nice place

236
00:21:53,349 --> 00:21:54,748
You're off now?

237
00:21:55,385 --> 00:21:56,352
You're still here?

238
00:21:57,053 --> 00:21:58,486
Didn't I tell you to go?

239
00:21:58,955 --> 00:21:59,649
Yeah, I should go

240
00:22:01,090 --> 00:22:06,585
But your sister...
Aren't you taking her with you?

241
00:22:07,130 --> 00:22:10,622
She'll live here alone?
I mean, being disabled and all...

242
00:22:11,334 --> 00:22:12,961
What business is that of yours?

243
00:22:14,337 --> 00:22:17,033
I was just asking...
I was worrying...

244
00:22:17,574 --> 00:22:18,802
Why should you worry?

245
00:22:19,976 --> 00:22:21,807
What the hell do you know about it?

246
00:22:23,446 --> 00:22:24,310
Clear off!

247
00:22:25,281 --> 00:22:27,215
Okay, I'm leaving

248
00:22:38,227 --> 00:22:38,955
Let's go

249
00:25:33,402 --> 00:25:35,233
I'm here to pick up the dishes

250
00:25:39,575 --> 00:25:40,974
The bill's paid, right?

251
00:25:41,410 --> 00:25:42,035
Yes, sir

252
00:26:13,509 --> 00:26:14,976
Why are you singing my song?

253
00:26:15,478 --> 00:26:16,376
I'm sorry...

254
00:26:41,771 --> 00:26:44,399
It's bad luck to have
someone sing after me

255
00:26:46,042 --> 00:26:47,475
Pick up the dishes and go!

256
00:26:48,077 --> 00:26:50,807
We're almost closed,
so I'm in no hurry

257
00:26:55,017 --> 00:26:56,917
I'm getting lousy cards tonight

258
00:26:57,854 --> 00:27:01,847
I guess it's not your lucky day!

259
00:27:15,705 --> 00:27:19,004
"HONG KONG RESTAURANT"

260
00:30:20,990 --> 00:30:22,685
Get out of the shot!

261
00:30:27,296 --> 00:30:30,197
Mister, what's going on here?

262
00:30:32,268 --> 00:30:33,394
Get out of the shot!

263
00:30:40,209 --> 00:30:41,073
What a nice car!

264
00:30:41,811 --> 00:30:47,078
Hey, you're not really driving!
I could do that, too

265
00:30:51,220 --> 00:30:55,953
What movie is it?
Who's in it?

266
00:30:56,092 --> 00:30:57,286
Speak up a bit

267
00:30:57,560 --> 00:30:58,424
I told you to get out
of the shot, man!

268
00:30:58,694 --> 00:30:59,991
Get the boom mike closer

269
00:31:34,864 --> 00:31:37,094
You think you're still a teenager?
A member of a bike gang?

270
00:31:37,967 --> 00:31:42,097
You took the food delivery
motorcycle for a midnight spin?

271
00:31:42,238 --> 00:31:43,466
Let him be

272
00:31:49,979 --> 00:31:51,378
Could you go outside to smoke?

273
00:32:02,825 --> 00:32:04,383
I'm sorry to tell you this

274
00:32:05,494 --> 00:32:07,291
But, I really don't like you

275
00:32:08,998 --> 00:32:10,761
I know this sounds harsh...

276
00:32:12,334 --> 00:32:14,700
But with you out of the way
I felt good about life

277
00:32:16,172 --> 00:32:19,198
Without you, we had no worries

278
00:32:20,309 --> 00:32:25,144
It's not only me, but your brother
and your Ma feel the same way

279
00:32:26,649 --> 00:32:31,814
I didn't want to tell you,
but I suppose it had to come out

280
00:33:12,394 --> 00:33:13,361
Can I help you?

281
00:33:13,963 --> 00:33:14,520
Pardon?

282
00:33:14,697 --> 00:33:15,994
What do you want?

283
00:33:18,467 --> 00:33:20,094
I'm here to deliver flowers

284
00:33:20,903 --> 00:33:21,733
Flowers?

285
00:33:22,538 --> 00:33:24,665
Someone's sending flowers
to Gong-Ju?

286
00:33:25,040 --> 00:33:25,870
Wait a moment

287
00:33:31,313 --> 00:33:32,302
Who sent them?

288
00:33:33,549 --> 00:33:35,676
I'm not allowed to tell just anyone

289
00:33:35,851 --> 00:33:36,510
I'll take them

290
00:33:37,653 --> 00:33:39,211
Give me the flowers

291
00:33:48,897 --> 00:33:50,558
She's asking who sent them

292
00:33:52,801 --> 00:33:53,733
Hong Jong-Du

293
00:33:54,136 --> 00:33:55,933
They're from someone
called Hong Jong-Du

294
00:33:56,305 --> 00:33:57,966
Alright, you can go now

295
00:35:27,563 --> 00:35:29,428
Anyone in?

296
00:35:59,561 --> 00:36:00,255
Hi!

297
00:36:01,930 --> 00:36:02,954
Do you like the flowers?

298
00:36:05,067 --> 00:36:07,592
Don't be scared,
I'm not here to hurt you

299
00:36:09,238 --> 00:36:11,069
Why am I here?
Don't you want to know?

300
00:36:12,875 --> 00:36:14,308
Should I tell you or not?

301
00:36:17,045 --> 00:36:20,503
I'm here because you interest me

302
00:36:22,151 --> 00:36:23,618
I want to get to know you better

303
00:36:23,819 --> 00:36:24,877
I'm not lying

304
00:36:29,525 --> 00:36:35,191
Looking like that at least,
you're not bad for a girl

305
00:36:45,073 --> 00:36:46,040
You're pretty

306
00:36:47,943 --> 00:36:51,140
I thought so the first time
I saw you

307
00:36:52,815 --> 00:36:55,079
Don't be scared!
Can't you trust me?

308
00:36:56,518 --> 00:36:57,644
I'll give you my phone number

309
00:37:05,160 --> 00:37:07,151
This is the number at my
brother's shop

310
00:37:10,132 --> 00:37:11,292
That's where I sleep

311
00:37:15,838 --> 00:37:17,169
So you can call me there anytime

312
00:37:29,418 --> 00:37:30,942
You have pretty feet, you know

313
00:37:31,920 --> 00:37:34,514
The prettiest I've ever seen

314
00:37:41,129 --> 00:37:43,597
To be honest, I've never seen
another woman's feet before

315
00:37:55,577 --> 00:37:57,044
You don't wear socks?

316
00:37:58,046 --> 00:38:01,573
Me neither, I get all sweaty

317
00:38:07,489 --> 00:38:08,547
What's wrong?

318
00:38:11,894 --> 00:38:13,088
It's alright...

319
00:38:17,833 --> 00:38:19,164
Be a good girl...

320
00:38:38,086 --> 00:38:42,079
Oh boy, they're beautiful...

321
00:38:59,007 --> 00:39:01,942
Come on, don't struggle

322
00:39:15,624 --> 00:39:18,320
Come on, just stay still,
for a second, okay?

323
00:39:21,296 --> 00:39:22,888
Just for a second

324
00:39:26,101 --> 00:39:28,262
Be a good girl, there you go...

325
00:39:30,706 --> 00:39:33,174
Stay still, bitch!

326
00:39:36,044 --> 00:39:38,239
Please...

327
00:39:38,513 --> 00:39:40,640
Please don't struggle, okay?

328
00:39:49,091 --> 00:39:49,819
Hey!

329
00:39:54,496 --> 00:39:58,523
Oh shit, this is trouble!

330
00:40:06,541 --> 00:40:07,803
Oh shit

331
00:40:19,254 --> 00:40:20,152
Fuck!

332
00:40:33,101 --> 00:40:35,296
Fucking asshole...

333
00:41:37,666 --> 00:41:38,155
What...?

334
00:41:41,002 --> 00:41:41,525
What?

335
00:41:44,473 --> 00:41:45,462
What?

336
00:42:07,395 --> 00:42:09,295
Rock, scissors, paper!

337
00:42:19,307 --> 00:42:20,296
Scissors! I win!

338
00:42:23,145 --> 00:42:24,442
Rock, scissors, paper!

339
00:42:26,214 --> 00:42:28,444
Paper! I win!

340
00:43:16,698 --> 00:43:18,893
Why aren't you at work?

341
00:43:22,671 --> 00:43:23,797
Is something wrong?

342
00:43:27,475 --> 00:43:28,703
You weren't in another accident,
were you?

343
00:43:29,377 --> 00:43:30,867
Why are the kids at home?

344
00:43:31,313 --> 00:43:32,803
They're on break

345
00:43:33,181 --> 00:43:35,877
I thought Ma was going out

346
00:43:36,251 --> 00:43:37,775
Where can she go?

347
00:43:37,919 --> 00:43:39,750
She's always complaining
that her legs hurt...

348
00:43:40,722 --> 00:43:42,087
Hey, why are you like this?

349
00:43:49,064 --> 00:43:50,429
Come on, come on

350
00:43:51,566 --> 00:43:53,033
I have to get back

351
00:43:53,201 --> 00:43:56,932
Your mother's waiting for me...
She'll suspect!

352
00:43:57,205 --> 00:43:58,672
Where are you going?

353
00:43:59,975 --> 00:44:01,169
Your breath smells!

354
00:44:01,576 --> 00:44:02,668
What did you have for lunch?

355
00:44:02,911 --> 00:44:04,173
You had dog soup, didn't you?

356
00:44:05,080 --> 00:44:07,173
Is that why you're so fired up?

357
00:44:29,571 --> 00:44:30,560
What's wrong?

358
00:44:30,939 --> 00:44:32,031
She's watching

359
00:44:33,375 --> 00:44:34,637
It doesn't matter

360
00:44:48,456 --> 00:44:50,549
The floor is cold!

361
00:46:33,795 --> 00:46:37,822
Oh my god, who's that?
I knew we shouldn't do this!

362
00:46:41,436 --> 00:46:42,334
Who is it?

363
00:46:43,671 --> 00:46:44,365
It's me

364
00:46:45,173 --> 00:46:45,935
Who?

365
00:46:46,441 --> 00:46:47,271
Me, Sang-Shik!

366
00:46:56,117 --> 00:46:58,085
Oh! Just a moment!

367
00:47:12,167 --> 00:47:12,826
How are you?

368
00:47:15,203 --> 00:47:16,602
You're both here?

369
00:47:17,072 --> 00:47:19,836
I was making Gong-Ju's lunch
and he was lending a hand too

370
00:47:20,241 --> 00:47:21,572
We worry about her...

371
00:47:21,943 --> 00:47:23,035
I'm much indebted

372
00:47:23,745 --> 00:47:24,507
Not at all!

373
00:47:25,113 --> 00:47:26,876
Gong-Ju, your brother's here!

374
00:47:28,550 --> 00:47:30,780
Gong-Ju, are you ready?

375
00:47:46,301 --> 00:47:46,926
Coming!

376
00:47:51,139 --> 00:47:52,197
Good afternoon

377
00:47:52,774 --> 00:47:55,004
We're from the district office and we're
conducting a survey of tenants

378
00:47:55,243 --> 00:47:57,211
Yes, I heard about it...
Do come in

379
00:47:57,445 --> 00:47:58,935
Sorry to be a bother

380
00:47:59,981 --> 00:48:02,779
The tenancy is in
the name of Han Gong-Ju

381
00:48:02,884 --> 00:48:04,977
Yes, she's my sister-in-law

382
00:48:06,087 --> 00:48:06,883
Is she here?

383
00:48:07,489 --> 00:48:08,183
She's in there

384
00:48:14,829 --> 00:48:16,319
She loves listening to music

385
00:48:16,464 --> 00:48:17,488
How do you do?

386
00:48:18,800 --> 00:48:21,963
She tends to get shy and clam up
in front of strangers

387
00:48:22,737 --> 00:48:24,932
Gong-Ju, do you want a drink?

388
00:48:25,473 --> 00:48:28,340
Oh, I haven't offered you anything
Can I get you a drink?

389
00:48:28,676 --> 00:48:29,665
Never mind, we should be going

390
00:48:29,978 --> 00:48:31,206
This building is for disabled tenants

391
00:48:31,312 --> 00:48:33,940
But, we've heard people moved
in using other names

392
00:48:34,215 --> 00:48:35,512
So we have to check in person

393
00:48:36,151 --> 00:48:38,415
Of course, it's only right

394
00:48:38,520 --> 00:48:39,452
Sorry to trouble you

395
00:48:44,225 --> 00:48:45,556
Thank you for your good work

396
00:48:54,435 --> 00:48:57,529
What have you been eating?
You weigh a ton!

397
00:49:03,878 --> 00:49:05,311
Darn light still doesn't work!

398
00:49:10,652 --> 00:49:13,416
Your sister-in-law is waiting in the car,
I should go now

399
00:49:13,821 --> 00:49:14,947
Give me a call if anything's wrong

400
00:49:16,624 --> 00:49:20,185
Call me if the neighbors don't feed
you properly or anything else

401
00:49:21,162 --> 00:49:22,561
After all, we're paying them
200,000 won a month

402
00:49:24,165 --> 00:49:26,929
200,000 won is not a small
amount, you know

403
00:49:28,403 --> 00:49:31,338
Alright, you go now

404
00:49:32,840 --> 00:49:33,829
I'll stop by when I can

405
00:50:48,483 --> 00:50:49,450
Hello?

406
00:50:51,953 --> 00:50:52,749
Pardon?

407
00:50:54,155 --> 00:50:54,917
Pardon?

408
00:50:56,291 --> 00:50:57,019
What are you saying?

409
00:51:00,261 --> 00:51:01,387
What the hell?

410
00:51:28,823 --> 00:51:34,420
I'm calling... to...

411
00:51:36,297 --> 00:51:45,865
...ask you something

412
00:52:44,532 --> 00:52:46,090
Relax

413
00:52:49,070 --> 00:52:52,631
Only if you say you'll forgive me

414
00:52:56,644 --> 00:52:59,545
You said you wanted to
ask me something

415
00:53:01,382 --> 00:53:02,406
What was it?

416
00:53:09,624 --> 00:53:10,249
Why...

417
00:53:11,893 --> 00:53:12,723
"Why..."

418
00:53:14,762 --> 00:53:15,729
Why... did you...

419
00:53:16,397 --> 00:53:17,364
"Why did you?"

420
00:53:19,434 --> 00:53:22,130
Why did you bring me flowers?

421
00:53:25,273 --> 00:53:27,434
Why did I bring you flowers?

422
00:53:31,979 --> 00:53:32,775
I don't really know

423
00:53:37,985 --> 00:53:40,453
Is your name really Gong-Ju?

424
00:53:42,056 --> 00:53:43,114
Yes

425
00:53:46,127 --> 00:53:46,752
Why?

426
00:53:48,229 --> 00:53:51,790
Well, because Gong-Ju
means "princess"...

427
00:54:04,946 --> 00:54:06,811
I'm descended from a general

428
00:54:07,548 --> 00:54:08,810
Ever heard of General Hong
Kyung-Rae?

429
00:54:16,657 --> 00:54:18,989
I'm his 1 8th-generation descendant!

430
00:54:21,329 --> 00:54:27,290
Hong Kyung-Rae... wasn't... a general

431
00:54:29,370 --> 00:54:30,200
Pardon?

432
00:54:32,273 --> 00:54:39,372
Hong Kyung-Rae... was a... traitor...
not a general...

433
00:54:40,181 --> 00:54:42,775
Hong Kyung-Rae was a traitor,
not a general?

434
00:54:44,552 --> 00:54:45,450
Was he?

435
00:55:02,103 --> 00:55:03,127
From now on...

436
00:55:04,839 --> 00:55:05,999
...I'm going to call you
Your Highness

437
00:55:07,441 --> 00:55:08,567
Your Highness, the princess!

438
00:55:14,215 --> 00:55:17,082
Then I will call you... General

439
00:55:18,019 --> 00:55:19,987
General?

440
00:55:26,527 --> 00:55:30,190
Your Highness!

441
00:55:34,302 --> 00:55:35,269
Yes, General!

442
00:55:41,075 --> 00:55:44,374
General, what do you do?

443
00:55:45,813 --> 00:55:46,541
Me?

444
00:55:47,081 --> 00:55:50,107
What do you do?

445
00:55:55,957 --> 00:55:57,015
I fix cars

446
00:56:01,929 --> 00:56:06,389
I work with my brother
at his small auto shop

447
00:56:09,403 --> 00:56:10,028
I envy you

448
00:56:10,805 --> 00:56:11,863
What's there to envy?

449
00:56:14,809 --> 00:56:20,406
I envy... people with jobs

450
00:56:25,453 --> 00:56:26,442
Are you stuffy in here?

451
00:56:27,021 --> 00:56:28,283
You want to go out for a while?

452
00:57:26,180 --> 00:57:26,976
Ma!

453
00:57:28,616 --> 00:57:33,383
Jong-Du

454
00:57:33,821 --> 00:57:34,617
How do you do?

455
00:57:34,955 --> 00:57:35,649
How do you do

456
00:57:35,890 --> 00:57:38,415
The pastor came to see us,
and he was just leaving

457
00:57:39,193 --> 00:57:40,217
I've heard a lot about you

458
00:57:40,461 --> 00:57:42,292
- You've been through a lot
- Thanks for your concern

459
00:57:42,630 --> 00:57:45,224
He sang in the choir
when he was little

460
00:57:45,633 --> 00:57:46,292
Is that so?

461
00:57:59,980 --> 00:58:02,039
Excuse me, I want to ask a favor

462
00:58:04,385 --> 00:58:07,354
Could you pray for me now?

463
00:58:07,955 --> 00:58:09,354
Come on now, Jong-Du...

464
00:58:10,624 --> 00:58:11,318
Right now?

465
00:58:11,625 --> 00:58:12,091
Yes, sir

466
00:58:13,327 --> 00:58:15,522
Why not? Let's pray together

467
00:58:16,197 --> 00:58:16,891
Gather around

468
00:58:21,035 --> 00:58:21,967
You too, Ma'am

469
00:58:24,805 --> 00:58:28,036
Let's all pray together, holding hands

470
00:58:33,981 --> 00:58:40,011
Our Father in heaven, please
watch over a poor soul...

471
00:58:40,521 --> 00:58:43,422
...who waits upon
Your salvation

472
00:58:43,724 --> 00:58:45,749
Please forgive his sins

473
00:58:46,093 --> 00:58:50,427
We beseech You to bestow
Your blessings upon him

474
00:58:50,698 --> 00:58:58,127
And to protect his soul from evil

475
00:58:58,339 --> 00:59:04,471
This young soul seeks to be reborn
in Your everlasting love

476
00:59:11,318 --> 00:59:12,080
Brother!

477
00:59:16,123 --> 00:59:17,215
Brother, teach me how to work here

478
00:59:19,293 --> 00:59:20,225
You want to learn how to fix cars?

479
00:59:22,396 --> 00:59:24,864
Here? From me?

480
00:59:25,266 --> 00:59:30,101
Yes, I want to learn!
I know I can do it

481
00:59:31,305 --> 00:59:32,203
I promise to work hard

482
00:59:34,508 --> 00:59:36,908
What's behind this?
What are you up to?

483
00:59:45,786 --> 00:59:47,686
That's not what I showed you!

484
00:59:49,657 --> 00:59:50,783
That way, it won't turn

485
00:59:51,091 --> 00:59:54,549
Fuck, this is hard!
Hey, how do you work this thing?

486
00:59:55,429 --> 00:59:56,589
Did you call me "Hey"?

487
00:59:59,800 --> 01:00:00,425
I mean "Sir"

488
01:00:01,001 --> 01:00:01,865
That's better

489
01:00:02,536 --> 01:00:04,527
Sir, how the hell does this work?

490
01:00:04,705 --> 01:00:05,672
Take this

491
01:00:25,092 --> 01:00:27,993
What's your favorite color?

492
01:00:30,231 --> 01:00:31,323
My favorite color?

493
01:00:34,702 --> 01:00:35,532
Let's see...

494
01:00:46,146 --> 01:00:49,274
My favorite is white

495
01:00:50,484 --> 01:00:53,476
Mine too... It's clean

496
01:01:03,998 --> 01:01:05,022
And your favorite season?

497
01:01:09,737 --> 01:01:12,205
Uh... summer

498
01:01:16,410 --> 01:01:19,106
I like winter!

499
01:01:21,482 --> 01:01:23,973
I don't like summer,
I get all sweaty

500
01:01:25,286 --> 01:01:30,747
Mosquitoes, flies... I really hate them

501
01:01:39,066 --> 01:01:40,192
Your favorite food?

502
01:01:41,168 --> 01:01:44,729
Jajang noodles!
Best thing in the world!

503
01:01:45,439 --> 01:01:48,272
I really craved for it
during my military service

504
01:01:49,443 --> 01:01:50,569
And you, Your Highness?

505
01:01:52,513 --> 01:01:55,710
I like everything...

506
01:01:56,617 --> 01:01:58,016
I'm no princess about food

507
01:02:01,655 --> 01:02:03,247
...except beans

508
01:02:04,625 --> 01:02:05,421
Beans?

509
01:02:05,993 --> 01:02:08,257
I hate beans the most

510
01:02:09,563 --> 01:02:11,155
Why do you hate beans?

511
01:02:12,466 --> 01:02:15,663
Makes me feel like throwing up

512
01:02:16,370 --> 01:02:18,270
There's something wrong with them

513
01:02:23,043 --> 01:02:26,706
Gong-Ju!
Is someone in here?

514
01:02:27,514 --> 01:02:28,173
No! No one!

515
01:02:29,283 --> 01:02:31,080
I thought I heard talking

516
01:02:32,252 --> 01:02:33,014
Just... radio

517
01:02:34,421 --> 01:02:37,549
Don't you get tired
of listening to it all day?

518
01:02:38,559 --> 01:02:40,117
You've hardly touched your food!

519
01:02:40,828 --> 01:02:42,386
I'm going out this evening

520
01:02:42,796 --> 01:02:44,457
Can you make do
with these leftovers?

521
01:02:44,999 --> 01:02:46,591
That's alright... I'm not very hungry

522
01:02:48,535 --> 01:02:50,560
Why are you smiling?
Something nice happen to you?

523
01:02:51,572 --> 01:02:52,539
I'll be going

524
01:03:14,803 --> 01:03:29,707
"If I were a poet,
I would sing for you..."

525
01:03:32,520 --> 01:03:43,522
"Like a child resting in its
mother's bosom..."

526
01:03:45,033 --> 01:03:50,699
"I want to..."

527
01:03:56,745 --> 01:04:04,709
"A little calf was sitting on
the stove and crying..."

528
01:04:05,453 --> 01:04:12,359
"Ma! Pa! My bottom is burning! "

529
01:04:20,335 --> 01:04:21,359
I'm... scared

530
01:04:23,204 --> 01:04:24,296
Scared of what?

531
01:04:26,241 --> 01:04:28,471
Over there... the shadow

532
01:04:38,953 --> 01:04:42,753
It's an Oasis!
What so scary?

533
01:04:43,024 --> 01:04:45,584
It's only the
shadow of a tree outside

534
01:04:46,895 --> 01:04:49,386
But... it's still scary

535
01:04:52,367 --> 01:04:55,097
Don't worry,
I'll get rid of it for you

536
01:04:55,970 --> 01:04:56,664
How?

537
01:05:00,408 --> 01:05:05,175
By magic! I'll make it
all disappear by magic

538
01:05:08,483 --> 01:05:09,211
Close your eyes

539
01:05:11,419 --> 01:05:15,355
Abracadabra!

540
01:05:16,191 --> 01:05:18,091
Going...

541
01:05:19,494 --> 01:05:22,054
Going...

542
01:05:22,931 --> 01:05:26,196
Gone!

543
01:06:18,052 --> 01:06:20,885
Gong-Ju! We're here!

544
01:06:36,304 --> 01:06:36,929
My voice?

545
01:06:39,574 --> 01:06:41,041
You like my voice?

546
01:06:42,143 --> 01:06:44,008
Yep, there's something
about my voice

547
01:06:50,819 --> 01:06:51,581
Pardon?

548
01:06:52,921 --> 01:06:55,822
You're saying my voice is good...

549
01:06:57,992 --> 01:06:59,118
But my face makes you sick?

550
01:07:03,464 --> 01:07:05,932
Your Highness

551
01:07:07,302 --> 01:07:11,398
You're upsetting me!

552
01:07:12,173 --> 01:07:13,572
What's wrong with my face?

553
01:07:20,114 --> 01:07:20,910
The shadow?

554
01:07:28,456 --> 01:07:32,859
The shadow is scaring you again?
And you need my magic?

555
01:07:34,629 --> 01:07:38,690
Okay, let me concentrate...

556
01:07:43,771 --> 01:07:46,239
Abracadabra!

557
01:07:46,841 --> 01:07:49,833
Abracadabra!

558
01:07:50,545 --> 01:07:52,775
It's going...

559
01:07:53,948 --> 01:07:55,882
It's going...

560
01:07:57,518 --> 01:08:00,043
It's going...
