1
00:07:00,235 --> 00:07:01,577
Can she see us?

2
00:07:01,777 --> 00:07:04,327
Can you see us?

3
00:07:04,527 --> 00:07:07,319
Take off your pants
and she'll see you.

4
00:10:42,069 --> 00:10:47,944
[in Chukchi]
<i>It will happen soon. I know it.</i>

5
00:10:53,485 --> 00:10:59,610
<i>I am going to die soon.</i>

6
00:11:01,694 --> 00:11:04,402
<i>This summer.</i>

7
00:11:12,485 --> 00:11:15,402
<i>You always say that.</i>

8
00:11:43,819 --> 00:11:47,819
Hey, Lyoshka...
are there any prostitutes in Anadyr?

9
00:11:49,860 --> 00:11:52,319
I think so.

10
00:11:54,402 --> 00:11:56,744
Let's invite one out here.

11
00:11:56,944 --> 00:11:59,610
We can find their numbers online.

12
00:12:00,902 --> 00:12:01,944
I dunno.

13
00:12:02,569 --> 00:12:06,152
She'd have to fly way out here.

14
00:12:07,777 --> 00:12:13,285
Yeah... Five hours here on the plane,
an hour of work,

15
00:12:13,485 --> 00:12:15,777
and then...
another five hours back.

16
00:12:18,152 --> 00:12:20,160
We could ship her in like a cargo.

17
00:12:20,360 --> 00:12:24,202
Are you nuts?
She'd freeze like a dumpling,

18
00:12:24,402 --> 00:12:29,194
and then your dick would freeze too.

19
00:12:51,402 --> 00:12:53,827
Remember that girl we watched?
What was that?

20
00:12:54,027 --> 00:12:55,660
Wait, was that your first time?

21
00:12:55,860 --> 00:12:58,194
You can watch chicks
on a webcam sex chat.

22
00:12:59,527 --> 00:13:05,194
They even show you their tits sometimes.

23
00:13:07,319 --> 00:13:09,735
They have ones from all over.

24
00:13:12,152 --> 00:13:14,527
From Africa and America.

25
00:13:15,485 --> 00:13:18,069
Like, ebony girls, or lesbo action...

26
00:13:21,402 --> 00:13:24,527
So what's that girl's name?

27
00:13:24,944 --> 00:13:28,735
HollySweet999.
You fall for her?

28
00:13:30,444 --> 00:13:32,577
Are you going to watch her again?

29
00:13:32,777 --> 00:13:35,069
Yeah, you've fallen for her.

30
00:14:14,860 --> 00:14:17,069
<i>Oh, it's you.</i>

31
00:14:23,110 --> 00:14:27,035
<i>I'll die tomorrow for sure.</i>

32
00:14:27,235 --> 00:14:29,902
<i>I'm busy tomorrow.</i>

33
00:16:42,402 --> 00:16:44,194
Hi.

34
00:16:54,360 --> 00:16:56,485
How're you doing?

35
00:17:03,819 --> 00:17:06,069
Can you hear me?

36
00:17:12,860 --> 00:17:14,652
You're...

37
00:17:16,819 --> 00:17:19,610
beautiful.

38
00:17:20,777 --> 00:17:23,694
We don't have blondes
like you in my village.

39
00:17:31,944 --> 00:17:34,735
What city are you from?

40
00:17:40,152 --> 00:17:41,652
I'm Lyoshka.

41
00:19:23,360 --> 00:19:30,952
<i>Well, hey there!</i>
<i>You finally made it.</i>

42
00:19:31,152 --> 00:19:34,410
<i>Give me a bigger piece.</i>

43
00:19:34,610 --> 00:19:37,660
<i>I didn't get anything</i>
<i>from the previous hunt.</i>

44
00:19:37,860 --> 00:19:42,902
<i>I was out in the tundra.</i>
<i>Thank you.</i>

45
00:20:18,360 --> 00:20:20,694
<i>Hi.</i>

46
00:20:29,360 --> 00:20:31,610
<i>Thank you.</i>

47
00:20:38,819 --> 00:20:40,652
Let's go to Lavry.

48
00:20:41,985 --> 00:20:45,869
I set up a date with a girl there,
she's expecting us, like.

49
00:20:46,069 --> 00:20:48,277
Wants to get to know us closer.

50
00:20:57,402 --> 00:21:01,360
Well? Wanna come?

51
00:21:04,902 --> 00:21:09,194
Lyoshka, I want you.

52
00:21:49,360 --> 00:21:54,152
If you were in a porno
would you fuck a cow?

53
00:22:41,569 --> 00:22:43,985
Shit, so much for our fucking trip!

54
00:22:55,235 --> 00:22:58,485
What a shit bike.

55
00:23:02,694 --> 00:23:05,652
It's totally dead.

56
00:23:09,027 --> 00:23:11,819
I should get a better cross bike.

57
00:23:36,235 --> 00:23:40,235
Well, it's summer. We won't freeze.

58
00:23:52,277 --> 00:23:58,952
That chick... the one from Lavry
who wants to meet up...

59
00:23:59,152 --> 00:24:01,694
you made her up, right?

60
00:26:04,944 --> 00:26:09,452
Ten years or so ago,
my uncle stole a boat,

61
00:26:09,652 --> 00:26:11,494
sailed across the Bering Strait,

62
00:26:11,694 --> 00:26:16,069
crossed the border,
and made it to Alaska.

63
00:26:16,360 --> 00:26:21,244
From there he walked to the big city.
It's called Teller.

64
00:26:21,444 --> 00:26:25,944
So there you go, five hours –
and a new life, America!

65
00:26:26,985 --> 00:26:29,577
They have skyscrapers
a thousand floors high.

66
00:26:29,777 --> 00:26:34,027
McDonald's and hot chicks
as far as you can see.

67
00:26:35,402 --> 00:26:37,577
America, America!

68
00:26:37,777 --> 00:26:42,985
But you can't go any more,
the border patrol stops people halfway.

69
00:26:45,194 --> 00:26:48,410
So how can I talk to her then?

70
00:26:48,610 --> 00:26:51,119
- To who?
- That chick from the chat.

71
00:26:51,319 --> 00:26:55,369
Dunno. Speak American to her, I guess.
That's where they're all from.

72
00:26:55,569 --> 00:26:57,735
Go on, give her a wave.

73
00:27:26,569 --> 00:27:31,069
<i>Let's talk about boys and girls.</i>

74
00:34:01,527 --> 00:34:03,577
<i>Who is that?</i>

75
00:34:03,777 --> 00:34:08,369
<i>It's... Kolya. Kolya Tanko.</i>
<i>From Provideniya.</i>

76
00:34:08,569 --> 00:34:12,319
<i>He was headed over there,</i>
<i>to Alaska.</i>

77
00:34:13,985 --> 00:34:18,319
<i>He got there in 40 minutes,</i>
<i>crossed the border.</i>

78
00:34:19,819 --> 00:34:22,569
<i>Then the Yankees found him.</i>

79
00:34:24,027 --> 00:34:30,277
<i>He had a harpoon on him.</i>
<i>And they thought... it was a firearm.</i>

80
00:34:31,360 --> 00:34:37,869
<i>They stopped him, started shouting,</i>
<i>"Drop your weapon!"</i>

81
00:34:38,069 --> 00:34:42,069
<i>But he didn't know their language.</i>

82
00:34:43,860 --> 00:34:45,735
<i>They shot him down.</i>

83
00:34:47,985 --> 00:34:53,777
<i>Probably wanted to see America.</i>
<i>He tried.</i>

84
00:35:16,569 --> 00:35:22,485
<i>- Galina! Galina!</i>
<i>- Out of the way, Chukchi!</i>

85
00:36:04,360 --> 00:36:05,785
Who is she?

86
00:36:05,985 --> 00:36:09,485
Some chick my uncle brought in
from the mainland.

87
00:36:13,360 --> 00:36:14,285
Everything's fine!

88
00:36:14,485 --> 00:36:17,327
Don't worry,
things will work out great for you.

89
00:36:17,527 --> 00:36:21,702
You'll have four daughters
and three sons.

90
00:36:21,902 --> 00:36:25,202
You'll go to Moscow.
You'll see the Kremlin,

91
00:36:25,402 --> 00:36:29,119
Red Square, Spasskaya Tower,
with the clock,

92
00:36:29,319 --> 00:36:30,660
and the President.

93
00:36:30,860 --> 00:36:33,035
Hang on, let's check this hand out.

94
00:36:33,235 --> 00:36:37,485
You will have a lot of reindeer.

95
00:38:46,485 --> 00:38:49,235
Well aren't you shy.

96
00:38:51,860 --> 00:38:54,485
Give me a hand?

97
00:39:00,152 --> 00:39:03,527
Don't worry, it's easy.

98
00:39:17,110 --> 00:39:18,827
Don't stand around,
come on over.

99
00:39:19,027 --> 00:39:20,535
Come on.

100
00:39:20,735 --> 00:39:22,777
Come on.

101
00:39:23,902 --> 00:39:26,077
Don't worry. I don't bite.

102
00:39:26,277 --> 00:39:29,319
See? Nothing scary about it.

103
00:39:32,152 --> 00:39:34,610
Hey, come on.

104
00:39:36,902 --> 00:39:40,485
Go ahead.
No need to be such a baby.

105
00:39:43,235 --> 00:39:44,410
Go for it!

106
00:39:44,610 --> 00:39:48,444
Touch me.
See how warm I am?

107
00:40:59,444 --> 00:41:03,319
Please... I'm so sorry!

108
00:41:05,402 --> 00:41:09,819
Nothing happened between us, anyway.

109
00:41:35,402 --> 00:41:39,985
DETROIT CITY

110
00:42:24,277 --> 00:42:26,860
Hey.

111
00:42:27,485 --> 00:42:30,285
- What are you up to?
- Just watching.

112
00:42:30,485 --> 00:42:33,535
- Watching who?
- HollySweet999.

113
00:42:33,735 --> 00:42:36,702
She showed me everything.
Even her tits.

114
00:42:36,902 --> 00:42:39,535
- Give it to me.
- No.

115
00:42:39,735 --> 00:42:42,235
- Give me the phone.
- No.

116
00:42:43,819 --> 00:42:47,285
Whoops! Check it out.

117
00:42:47,485 --> 00:42:51,494
- You've had your fun, now stop it.
- She totally showed me everything.

118
00:42:51,694 --> 00:42:55,869
- Give it back!
- You can have it. For a kiss.

119
00:42:56,069 --> 00:43:00,152
- Fucking give it!
- Come and get it.

120
00:43:10,735 --> 00:43:12,910
Come on, come on,
Kolyan, take him down!

121
00:43:13,110 --> 00:43:15,069
Come on!

122
00:43:17,235 --> 00:43:22,360
Come on, Kolyan, take him down!

123
00:43:35,360 --> 00:43:37,860
Go back to America.

124
00:45:46,152 --> 00:45:48,527
I can't take this.

125
00:48:43,735 --> 00:48:45,319
Hey!

126
00:48:46,485 --> 00:48:48,277
Get up!

127
00:49:05,944 --> 00:49:07,985
Quit flopping!

128
00:49:21,319 --> 00:49:25,152
HolySweet Nine nine.

129
00:49:31,194 --> 00:49:36,702
You're still thinking about her?!
She doesn't exist. She's just virtual.

130
00:49:36,902 --> 00:49:40,027
Millions of people jerk off to her.

131
00:54:05,985 --> 00:54:10,735
I love you...

132
00:54:12,610 --> 00:54:14,985
I love you.

133
00:54:34,985 --> 00:54:38,119
What fucking user?

134
00:54:38,319 --> 00:54:41,235
What user?

135
00:55:09,360 --> 00:55:11,027
Are you with her?!

136
00:55:11,860 --> 00:55:14,485
I know you are, you fucker!

137
00:55:18,735 --> 00:55:20,569
Come on out!

138
00:57:49,902 --> 00:57:53,902
USSR–USA

139
00:59:57,444 --> 01:00:01,194
DITROIT

140
01:05:13,985 --> 01:05:15,944
On the run?

141
01:05:23,110 --> 01:05:25,652
Headed for Alaska?

142
01:05:30,319 --> 01:05:33,985
This is an island,
in the border zone.

143
01:05:44,444 --> 01:05:47,319
Are you... poachers?

144
01:05:51,485 --> 01:05:54,569
I can show you the future,
if you want.

145
01:06:15,110 --> 01:06:19,702
Look, kid: that there is Alaska,

146
01:06:19,902 --> 01:06:23,569
and that... is Chukotka.

147
01:06:25,027 --> 01:06:29,110
America. Russia.

148
01:06:29,860 --> 01:06:33,485
The past. The future.

149
01:06:33,985 --> 01:06:39,527
Take a step:
the past, the future.

150
01:06:40,944 --> 01:06:45,152
Monday. Tuesday.

151
01:07:09,277 --> 01:07:12,152
I killed my friend.

152
01:07:16,694 --> 01:07:18,777
Over some woman?

153
01:14:52,944 --> 01:14:55,194
I have a girlfriend there.

154
01:14:55,944 --> 01:14:57,860
I have a girlfriend there.

155
01:21:13,027 --> 01:21:15,735
America...

156
01:21:16,985 --> 01:21:19,194
America...

157
01:21:21,860 --> 01:21:24,610
America...

158
01:21:29,819 --> 01:21:32,777
America...

159
01:25:56,777 --> 01:25:59,277
I've had enough.

160
01:26:06,194 --> 01:26:09,235
I am tired of this America already.

161
01:29:07,110 --> 01:29:08,452
Hey bro!

162
01:29:08,652 --> 01:29:12,110
- What's up?
- I'm alright!

163
01:29:14,569 --> 01:29:18,202
- What's with your head?
- You bashed it the fuck in.

164
01:29:18,402 --> 01:29:23,194
- Oh, I forgot!
- Shit, you're stupid.

165
01:29:24,360 --> 01:29:26,494
Don't fucking hit it, it hurts!

166
01:29:26,694 --> 01:29:30,110
Ages since I saw the village.

167
01:29:32,110 --> 01:29:34,444
I thought I killed you.

168
01:29:36,402 --> 01:29:39,077
Mom said I got 5 stitches.

169
01:29:39,277 --> 01:29:41,610
My brain almost leaked out.

170
01:30:06,360 --> 01:30:10,702
<i>Take me to the tundra.</i>

171
01:30:10,902 --> 01:30:15,069
<i>I'm going to die today.</i>

172
01:31:12,152 --> 01:31:15,235
<i>I'm hungry.</i>

173
01:31:15,860 --> 01:31:18,944
<i>I won't die today.</i>

174
01:31:21,985 --> 01:31:26,444
<i>Take me home.</i>
