17
00:02:43,963 --> 00:02:46,761
So what exactly is it you want?

18
00:02:48,868 --> 00:02:53,771
Look, National Shoes
is in business to make money.

19
00:02:53,973 --> 00:02:57,739
That's right. You should
think twice about this model.

20
00:02:58,945 --> 00:03:01,778
Do you really think
it will boost sales?

21
00:03:01,981 --> 00:03:02,777
Hold on a second.

22
00:03:04,050 --> 00:03:06,746
We're not losing money.

23
00:03:07,253 --> 00:03:10,518
They're great shoes,
but they cost too much.

24
00:03:10,723 --> 00:03:12,520
And they're old-fashioned.

25
00:03:12,725 --> 00:03:14,625
And another thing.

26
00:03:14,827 --> 00:03:16,488
They're too durable.

27
00:03:17,030 --> 00:03:19,828
If shoes don't wear out,
we don't sell any.

28
00:03:20,667 --> 00:03:24,433
Look, Gondo,
women see shoes as accessories,

29
00:03:24,637 --> 00:03:26,571
like hats and handbags.

30
00:03:26,773 --> 00:03:30,641
They flock to stylish designs
at affordable prices.

31
00:03:30,877 --> 00:03:32,208
Exactly.

32
00:03:32,412 --> 00:03:36,314
Our shoes are practical.

33
00:03:36,816 --> 00:03:41,549
Women's hats don't wear long.

34
00:03:41,754 --> 00:03:42,812
Why should their shoes?

35
00:03:43,022 --> 00:03:46,082
You're wrong.
Shoes and hats aren't the same.

36
00:03:46,292 --> 00:03:49,819
A woman wears
a hat on her head,

37
00:03:50,330 --> 00:03:52,457
but shoes carry all her weight.

38
00:04:01,007 --> 00:04:03,703
1-0 for you.

39
00:04:03,943 --> 00:04:07,379
Listen, you may be happy
with our product line,

40
00:04:07,580 --> 00:04:12,608
but as director I have to ask
why sales have been flat.

41
00:04:13,019 --> 00:04:14,247
That's why we're here.

42
00:04:14,454 --> 00:04:17,150
What are you asking me to do?

43
00:04:18,925 --> 00:04:20,893
Let me be frank.

44
00:04:21,427 --> 00:04:24,521
We are the directors
of National Shoes.

45
00:04:25,098 --> 00:04:29,262
I'm in charge of sales and operations.
You run the factory.

46
00:04:29,502 --> 00:04:33,268
Ishimaru takes care of design.
Kamiya handles marketing.

47
00:04:33,606 --> 00:04:35,437
Kawanishi is your right hand,

48
00:04:35,642 --> 00:04:38,702
and a future executive.

49
00:04:39,512 --> 00:04:44,040
We're all agreed
on what our problem is.

50
00:04:44,250 --> 00:04:45,740
And what might that be?

51
00:04:46,219 --> 00:04:47,208
Our president.

52
00:04:47,420 --> 00:04:51,754
The Old Man's backward.
His dream shoe is an army boot.

53
00:04:51,958 --> 00:04:55,553
But he holds enough stock
to dominate the shareholder meetings.

54
00:04:55,762 --> 00:04:57,423
We can't do a thing.

55
00:04:57,630 --> 00:04:59,860
Show him the sample.

56
00:05:05,305 --> 00:05:09,969
Look at this style, this taste.
It's a sure winner.

57
00:05:10,276 --> 00:05:12,141
Ishimaru,
this is a masterpiece.

58
00:05:12,378 --> 00:05:15,575
And we can make them
at half the cost.

59
00:05:19,252 --> 00:05:20,116
Well?

60
00:05:22,622 --> 00:05:24,317
What would
the Old Man say?

61
00:05:25,058 --> 00:05:27,356
We won't let him say anything.

62
00:05:28,361 --> 00:05:33,355
He may own a lot of stock,
but what if we join forces?

63
00:05:34,600 --> 00:05:37,125
He holds 25%.

64
00:05:37,570 --> 00:05:39,902
You three together hold 21%.

65
00:05:40,306 --> 00:05:41,864
Not enough to vote him out.

66
00:05:42,075 --> 00:05:43,702
Gondo...

67
00:05:44,811 --> 00:05:48,372
we included your holdings
in our calculations.

68
00:05:49,248 --> 00:05:52,308
What do you say?
Will you join us?

69
00:05:53,052 --> 00:05:57,318
With your 13%,
we'd have 34%.

70
00:05:57,757 --> 00:06:00,521
More than enough
to boot the Old Man out.

71
00:06:01,627 --> 00:06:05,563
And who'd be
the new president?

72
00:06:07,600 --> 00:06:13,038
Well, you're certainly
a candidate, but...

73
00:06:13,239 --> 00:06:17,175
But since this plan
was Baba's idea,

74
00:06:17,510 --> 00:06:19,637
<i>he'll be the next president.</i>

75
00:06:19,979 --> 00:06:22,470
You'll be executive director.

76
00:06:22,682 --> 00:06:25,310
Fair enough?

77
00:06:53,346 --> 00:06:56,144
The Old Man may be
old-fashioned,

78
00:06:56,349 --> 00:07:00,046
but at least he makes
real shoes.

79
00:07:00,253 --> 00:07:03,245
Yours are trash.

80
00:07:03,456 --> 00:07:04,980
Listen to me.

81
00:07:05,825 --> 00:07:10,762
I started as an apprentice
at National Shoes when I was 16.

82
00:07:10,963 --> 00:07:15,161
Aside from time in the army,
I've spent 30 years of my life there.

83
00:07:16,235 --> 00:07:19,602
I know every sound
and smell in that factory.

84
00:07:20,440 --> 00:07:24,638
We've made many shoes.
I remember them all.

85
00:07:24,844 --> 00:07:27,506
They were all good,
durable shoes.

86
00:07:28,047 --> 00:07:31,346
I can't put our name
on garbage like this.

87
00:07:31,551 --> 00:07:35,817
Listen!
This shoe wouldn't last a month.

88
00:07:36,322 --> 00:07:38,381
There's no steel shank.

89
00:07:38,591 --> 00:07:40,422
The insole is cardboard,

90
00:07:40,626 --> 00:07:43,151
glued rather than
properly stitched.

91
00:07:43,362 --> 00:07:46,195
The inner lining is flimsy.

92
00:07:47,099 --> 00:07:48,862
You want money for this?

93
00:07:49,068 --> 00:07:50,626
But the costs...

94
00:07:50,837 --> 00:07:52,771
Costs are eating our profits.

95
00:07:52,972 --> 00:07:54,872
- Business is business!
- I know that!

96
00:07:55,074 --> 00:07:58,532
I love this business
more than I can say.

97
00:07:58,744 --> 00:08:00,939
Shoes are my life.
I won't do slipshod work.

98
00:08:01,414 --> 00:08:04,781
So you'll keep making
the Old Man's army boots?

99
00:08:05,685 --> 00:08:08,449
No. He's wrong too.

100
00:08:19,332 --> 00:08:21,960
He's wrong. We're wrong.
What's left?

101
00:08:23,169 --> 00:08:28,505
I'll make my ideal shoes:
Comfortable, durable, yet stylish.

102
00:08:29,242 --> 00:08:32,211
Expensive to make maybe,

103
00:08:32,445 --> 00:08:35,539
but profitable
in the long run.

104
00:08:35,748 --> 00:08:40,185
How romantic.
Only we won't let you.

105
00:08:41,420 --> 00:08:47,620
If we vote with the Old Man,
we can force you out.

106
00:08:47,827 --> 00:08:50,660
<i>Be my guest. The shareholders'
meeting is next month.</i>

107
00:08:52,798 --> 00:08:55,699
Kawanishi,
show the gentlemen the door.

108
00:09:05,878 --> 00:09:08,540
Leaving already?

109
00:09:10,149 --> 00:09:11,377
Pardon us, Mrs. Gondo.

110
00:09:11,584 --> 00:09:14,576
Why isn't my husband
seeing you out?

111
00:09:20,660 --> 00:09:22,127
If you'll excuse us.

112
00:09:41,447 --> 00:09:45,178
What just happened?

113
00:09:45,585 --> 00:09:46,984
Nothing.

114
00:09:47,186 --> 00:09:49,381
It certainly didn't look
that way.

115
00:09:50,590 --> 00:09:53,457
Don't worry.
You wouldn't understand.

116
00:09:53,659 --> 00:09:55,320
It's business.

117
00:09:55,528 --> 00:09:59,862
You always say that
to keep me quiet.

118
00:10:03,336 --> 00:10:05,634
What's he got up his sleeve?

119
00:10:06,038 --> 00:10:10,566
You're his right-hand man.
You must know his plan.

120
00:10:11,043 --> 00:10:15,673
The son of a bitch, kicking us out!
Must be pretty sure of himself.

121
00:10:15,881 --> 00:10:18,076
What's he up to?

122
00:10:19,218 --> 00:10:20,742
Why didn't you
ask him yourself?

123
00:10:20,953 --> 00:10:22,784
Don't be a wiseass.

124
00:10:23,289 --> 00:10:25,189
You may not know his scheme,

125
00:10:25,391 --> 00:10:29,191
but help us stop him
and we'll make you a director.

126
00:10:31,063 --> 00:10:33,327
Please don't tempt me.

127
00:10:34,100 --> 00:10:37,536
You want to be his flunky forever?
Think it over.

128
00:11:01,127 --> 00:11:02,719
Jun, that's enough!

129
00:11:17,243 --> 00:11:19,211
They're furious.

130
00:11:22,281 --> 00:11:24,078
Will we be all right?

131
00:11:24,417 --> 00:11:26,146
Wait and see.

132
00:11:26,852 --> 00:11:29,446
A new round of feuding?

133
00:11:30,289 --> 00:11:31,984
Sure looks like it.

134
00:11:32,725 --> 00:11:38,425
They want to kick me out,
but I've taken measures.

135
00:11:38,631 --> 00:11:42,397
They'd have to be pretty serious.
What measures?

136
00:11:44,003 --> 00:11:46,870
I don't want to say
until everything's in place.

137
00:11:47,473 --> 00:11:50,101
Then I'll do them all in.

138
00:11:53,446 --> 00:11:55,607
Jun really takes after you.

139
00:11:56,649 --> 00:11:59,174
You both love blood sport.

140
00:11:59,385 --> 00:12:01,114
Jun!

141
00:12:01,587 --> 00:12:05,683
Oh, Shinichi, it's you.
- I'm the sheriff this time.

142
00:12:07,093 --> 00:12:10,028
Jun, is it your turn
to be the outlaw?

143
00:12:10,930 --> 00:12:14,889
Well, don't run.
Hide and then ambush the sheriff.

144
00:12:15,968 --> 00:12:18,436
A man must kill or be killed.

145
00:12:18,637 --> 00:12:20,468
Now go. And don't lose.

146
00:12:26,412 --> 00:12:29,245
- You get worse by the day.
- What do you mean?

147
00:12:29,615 --> 00:12:31,515
Your attitude.

148
00:12:32,518 --> 00:12:35,612
Success isn't worth
losing your humanity.

149
00:12:35,821 --> 00:12:37,686
A woman can't understand.

150
00:12:37,890 --> 00:12:40,688
This isn't about wanting
to become president.

151
00:12:40,893 --> 00:12:43,259
I just want
to make shoes my way.

152
00:12:49,435 --> 00:12:50,959
Yes, it is.

153
00:12:52,238 --> 00:12:54,502
Osaka Hotel?
Did you call Osaka?

154
00:12:54,707 --> 00:12:56,231
One moment.

155
00:12:57,076 --> 00:12:58,134
Hello?

156
00:12:58,344 --> 00:13:01,575
Room 310, please.
Gondo calling.

157
00:13:04,583 --> 00:13:08,713
Hello. It's me.
How'd it go? All settled?

158
00:13:09,889 --> 00:13:13,586
How much?
Within my limit?

159
00:13:14,160 --> 00:13:16,094
Great work!

160
00:13:17,396 --> 00:13:20,524
Good. Settle the deal.
And quickly.

161
00:13:20,800 --> 00:13:23,701
Call me again when it's done.

162
00:13:23,903 --> 00:13:26,235
I'll send the deposit tonight.

163
00:13:27,807 --> 00:13:29,502
I'm counting on you.

164
00:13:32,011 --> 00:13:35,139
I want you to go to Osaka.
Book a flight.

165
00:13:37,283 --> 00:13:41,219
Use the phone upstairs.
I'm waiting for a call.

166
00:14:38,544 --> 00:14:40,307
Is everything all right?

167
00:14:41,547 --> 00:14:44,539
Something about this
scares me.

168
00:14:47,686 --> 00:14:50,211
Hello. Yes, it's me.

169
00:14:51,390 --> 00:14:54,086
It's all set?
Great, thanks.

170
00:14:54,293 --> 00:14:55,317
Just a moment.

171
00:14:55,527 --> 00:14:56,824
Well?

172
00:14:57,129 --> 00:14:58,255
10:00 p.m. Flight.

173
00:14:58,464 --> 00:15:04,494
Kawanishi's off at 10:00
with a check for 50 million.

174
00:15:11,043 --> 00:15:12,704
Time for a toast.

175
00:15:17,182 --> 00:15:21,016
I kept you two in the dark,
but now I can talk about it.

176
00:15:21,220 --> 00:15:25,316
My share isn't 13%.

177
00:15:26,258 --> 00:15:29,489
I've bought 15% more
over the last three years,

178
00:15:30,062 --> 00:15:33,498
and just now on the phone,
I bought another 19%.

179
00:15:34,133 --> 00:15:36,567
That's 47%.

180
00:15:36,769 --> 00:15:40,170
Even with the Old Man,
they only have 46%.

181
00:15:40,572 --> 00:15:44,338
It was a risky move,
but National Shoes is mine.

182
00:15:47,012 --> 00:15:50,277
But where did you get
that kind of money?

183
00:15:50,482 --> 00:15:54,418
I borrowed against everything,
including this house.

184
00:15:56,822 --> 00:16:00,417
It was hard work
raising 50 million.

185
00:16:01,660 --> 00:16:05,994
One yen less
and Osaka would have refused.

186
00:16:07,232 --> 00:16:10,690
Now I don't even own
the clothes on my back.

187
00:16:10,903 --> 00:16:13,167
I've bet my entire fortune.

188
00:16:14,373 --> 00:16:17,740
But wait a minute.

189
00:16:18,110 --> 00:16:20,010
This is just
the deposit, isn't it?

190
00:16:20,512 --> 00:16:24,778
That's usually one third.
Where's the other 100 million?

191
00:16:24,984 --> 00:16:28,920
If I gain control of the company,
I'll get the rest.

192
00:16:35,995 --> 00:16:40,227
In shock?
Have a drink.

193
00:16:43,502 --> 00:16:44,799
<i>Excuse me.</i>

194
00:16:45,838 --> 00:16:49,239
Have you seen my boy, Shinichi?

195
00:16:49,441 --> 00:16:52,035
He and Jun are outside.
What is it?

196
00:16:52,277 --> 00:16:54,609
I brought this for him.

197
00:16:57,316 --> 00:16:58,283
I'll call Jun.

198
00:16:59,251 --> 00:17:01,981
Aoki, drive Kawanishi
to the airport.

199
00:17:02,187 --> 00:17:03,984
My flight's at 10:00.

200
00:17:10,829 --> 00:17:12,729
Yes, this is Gondo.

201
00:17:13,665 --> 00:17:18,193
What?
You've kidnapped my son?

202
00:17:19,171 --> 00:17:20,263
What kind of joke is this?

203
00:17:20,472 --> 00:17:22,303
<i>It's not a Joke.</i>

204
00:17:22,775 --> 00:17:23,867
<i>Listen.</i>

205
00:17:24,610 --> 00:17:26,601
<i>I have your son.</i>

206
00:17:26,812 --> 00:17:29,713
<i>If you do as I say,
I'll let him live.</i>

207
00:17:29,915 --> 00:17:31,746
<i>Get 30 million yen.</i>

208
00:17:31,950 --> 00:17:33,383
Thirty million?

209
00:17:33,585 --> 00:17:35,644
<i>No consecutive serial numbers.</i>

210
00:17:35,854 --> 00:17:38,516
<i>- One thousand 10,000-yen notes...
- Wait a second!</i>

211
00:17:40,759 --> 00:17:44,456
<i>- One thousand...
- 10,000-yen notes.</i>

212
00:17:44,663 --> 00:17:47,564
<i>Three thousand 5,000-yen notes,</i>

213
00:17:47,800 --> 00:17:50,234
<i>and five thousand 1,000-yen notes.</i>

214
00:17:50,436 --> 00:17:51,698
<i>Total: 30 million yen.</i>

215
00:17:51,904 --> 00:17:52,836
Thirty million!

216
00:17:53,038 --> 00:17:57,338
<i>Have it ready by tomorrow.
I'll have more details then.</i>

217
00:17:57,543 --> 00:17:59,875
<i>If you love your son,
don't call the police.</i>

218
00:18:00,079 --> 00:18:01,546
No, of course not.

219
00:18:01,747 --> 00:18:04,215
<i>So long, Mr. Gondo.</i>

220
00:18:08,554 --> 00:18:11,887
Thirty million yen?
Just hurry and pay it!

221
00:18:12,091 --> 00:18:12,955
Get Jun back!

222
00:18:13,158 --> 00:18:14,625
Calm down!

223
00:18:15,928 --> 00:18:19,364
I'll get him back,
no matter what it costs.

224
00:18:20,532 --> 00:18:22,523
I can raise more money later.

225
00:18:23,635 --> 00:18:25,500
I'll call the police.

226
00:18:25,971 --> 00:18:28,963
Fool!
You'll put Jun in danger.

227
00:18:30,175 --> 00:18:34,805
- Kingo!
- Don't worry! It'll be all right!

228
00:18:37,049 --> 00:18:39,847
Mom, did you call me?

229
00:18:40,152 --> 00:18:41,346
Jun!

230
00:18:49,995 --> 00:18:51,758
What's the matter, Mom?

231
00:18:53,432 --> 00:18:55,127
What's going on?

232
00:18:56,368 --> 00:18:58,928
What kind of sick joke is this?

233
00:19:06,678 --> 00:19:09,146
Jun, where's Shinichi?

234
00:19:09,348 --> 00:19:12,875
Don't know. I hid like you said,
but he never came.

235
00:19:13,085 --> 00:19:14,552
Some sheriff!

236
00:19:15,787 --> 00:19:19,245
Wait, Shinichi was wearing
Jun's outfit.

237
00:19:19,458 --> 00:19:21,517
Even I got them mixed up.

238
00:19:23,428 --> 00:19:24,759
Shinichi!

239
00:19:28,033 --> 00:19:29,364
Call the police.

240
00:19:29,568 --> 00:19:32,537
No, you can't!
What'll happen to Shinichi?

241
00:19:32,738 --> 00:19:34,603
The kidnapper will realize
he has the wrong kid.

242
00:19:34,806 --> 00:19:37,900
A chauffeur can't pay a ransom.
He'll let him go.

243
00:19:38,110 --> 00:19:41,375
But I won't let him
get away with this.

244
00:19:52,024 --> 00:19:55,323
- Is that the police?
- No.

245
00:19:55,527 --> 00:19:57,017
A department store delivery.

246
00:19:57,596 --> 00:19:59,188
Odd at this hour.

247
00:19:59,398 --> 00:20:02,925
What the hell's
taking them so long?

248
00:20:05,204 --> 00:20:08,469
Aoki, don't worry yourself
to death.

249
00:20:08,674 --> 00:20:11,108
Any way you look at it,
Shinichi has to be safe.

250
00:20:19,952 --> 00:20:22,682
Kingo, it's the police.

251
00:20:23,922 --> 00:20:27,449
<i>Madam, would you mind
closing all the drapes?</i>

252
00:20:44,109 --> 00:20:46,270
I'm Chief Inspector Tokura.

253
00:20:47,179 --> 00:20:50,478
From the streets below,
if he has a telescope,

254
00:20:52,017 --> 00:20:55,316
the kidnapper can see
this entire room.

255
00:20:55,988 --> 00:20:58,786
Any other phones in the house?
- One upstairs.

256
00:20:58,991 --> 00:21:01,687
- Are they listed?
- Just this one.

257
00:21:01,927 --> 00:21:03,394
The phone's over there, guys.

258
00:21:03,629 --> 00:21:06,723
We'll install a listening device
to record his calls.

259
00:21:08,934 --> 00:21:11,835
But, Inspector,
I doubt he'll call again

260
00:21:12,638 --> 00:21:14,731
when he realizes
he has the wrong child.

261
00:21:14,940 --> 00:21:18,171
He may still think
he has your son.

262
00:21:18,377 --> 00:21:21,437
Broadcast the mistake
on radio and TV.

263
00:21:21,647 --> 00:21:25,640
If we do, he'll know
you contacted us.

264
00:21:25,851 --> 00:21:27,011
So?

265
00:21:27,219 --> 00:21:29,779
He warned you
he'd kill the boy if you did.

266
00:21:29,988 --> 00:21:32,081
That's when he thought
it was my son.

267
00:21:32,291 --> 00:21:34,452
He has to return a child
whose father can't pay.

268
00:21:34,693 --> 00:21:36,354
You may think so,

269
00:21:37,296 --> 00:21:39,560
but he may not.

270
00:21:48,407 --> 00:21:51,604
Kidnapping cases are difficult.

271
00:21:52,711 --> 00:21:55,578
The hostage is his protection.

272
00:21:56,214 --> 00:21:58,978
On our way here
the chief told us,

273
00:21:59,384 --> 00:22:04,014
"Save the child first,
then catch the kidnapper."

274
00:22:06,325 --> 00:22:10,386
We must be especially careful
in this case.

275
00:22:11,196 --> 00:22:16,065
The highest ransom ever demanded
was two million,

276
00:22:16,268 --> 00:22:18,634
with most in the range
of 200,000 to 300,000.

277
00:22:19,404 --> 00:22:21,599
Thirty million
is an extraordinary sum.

278
00:22:21,807 --> 00:22:25,538
The kidnapper's extreme.

279
00:22:25,744 --> 00:22:27,939
He may be mentally disturbed.

280
00:22:32,751 --> 00:22:35,185
Are you the boy's father?

281
00:22:35,821 --> 00:22:40,053
He's a widower.
It's his only child too.

282
00:22:40,258 --> 00:22:42,658
Will you get my boy back?

283
00:22:44,062 --> 00:22:45,962
We'll do everything we can.

284
00:22:47,032 --> 00:22:49,000
<i>What will you do next?</i>

285
00:22:49,201 --> 00:22:52,637
<i>Wait for his next move.
It's all we can do.</i>

286
00:22:53,705 --> 00:22:57,038
I know how hard
it is just to wait,

287
00:22:57,242 --> 00:22:59,733
but it's safest for the boy.

288
00:23:00,812 --> 00:23:02,211
All set.

289
00:23:02,414 --> 00:23:06,475
Have the phone company trace
all incoming calls.

290
00:23:06,685 --> 00:23:08,243
This way, please.

291
00:23:09,354 --> 00:23:13,051
- Where's your son, Mrs. Gondo?
- In the dining room.

292
00:23:13,358 --> 00:23:17,260
Taguchi, ask him everything
about the kidnapping.

293
00:23:18,463 --> 00:23:20,454
No, wait.
Nakao, you do it.

294
00:23:20,999 --> 00:23:25,333
Taguchi might frighten the boy.

295
00:23:27,539 --> 00:23:29,837
Taguchi,
you talk to the father.

296
00:23:30,275 --> 00:23:32,675
Do you have a recent picture?

297
00:23:32,878 --> 00:23:35,108
Yes. I'll get it.

298
00:23:42,554 --> 00:23:45,648
I should drive Mr. Kawanishi
to the airport soon.

299
00:23:46,291 --> 00:23:49,454
You're in no shape to drive.
Kawanishi, take a cab.

300
00:23:54,433 --> 00:23:57,266
Wait. It may be
the kidnapper.

301
00:23:57,469 --> 00:23:58,936
Upstairs phone.

302
00:23:59,171 --> 00:24:01,696
Keep him talking.

303
00:24:01,907 --> 00:24:03,898
We may be able to trace him.

304
00:24:05,844 --> 00:24:07,243
Go ahead.

305
00:24:12,317 --> 00:24:15,445
Hello. Gondo speaking.

306
00:24:18,123 --> 00:24:21,217
<i>Hello. Gondo speaking.</i>

307
00:24:23,962 --> 00:24:25,793
<i>I got the wrong boy.</i>

308
00:24:26,431 --> 00:24:29,025
<i>But before you start
celebrating, listen:</i>

309
00:24:29,234 --> 00:24:32,692
<i>I don't care whose boy it is.
You're still paying.</i>

310
00:24:32,904 --> 00:24:34,963
<i>You can't be serious.
Why me?</i>

311
00:24:35,207 --> 00:24:36,697
<i>Don't ask questions.</i>

312
00:24:37,275 --> 00:24:41,268
<i>It's simple:
Pay the 30 million or the boy dies.</i>

313
00:24:41,480 --> 00:24:42,777
<i>This is absurd!</i>

314
00:24:42,981 --> 00:24:45,882
<i>Exactly. It's absurd.</i>

315
00:24:47,586 --> 00:24:50,282
<i>Taking the wrong boy
was a lucky break.</i>

316
00:24:51,022 --> 00:24:54,219
<i>Did you know, Mr. Gondo,
that it's only extortion</i>

317
00:24:55,026 --> 00:24:59,588
<i>when you threaten
a person or his kin?</i>

318
00:24:59,831 --> 00:25:03,164
<i>In other words,
this doesn't count.</i>

319
00:25:03,835 --> 00:25:07,293
<i>But you have to pay anyway.</i>

320
00:25:07,606 --> 00:25:10,734
<i>You're a fool to pay,
but pay you must.</i>

321
00:25:10,942 --> 00:25:15,174
<i>Who says I'll pay?
I absolutely will not!</i>

322
00:25:15,413 --> 00:25:16,937
<i>You will.</i>

323
00:25:17,916 --> 00:25:20,111
<i>You won't let him die.</i>

324
00:25:20,318 --> 00:25:22,718
<i>You don't have the guts, Mr. Gondo.</i>

325
00:25:35,901 --> 00:25:37,596
He's a monster.

326
00:25:37,869 --> 00:25:40,167
Smartest crook I ever saw.

327
00:25:40,372 --> 00:25:46,368
Kidnap any child off the street,
then pick a millionaire to squeeze.

328
00:25:46,678 --> 00:25:48,805
And he's right:
It wouldn't be extortion,

329
00:25:49,281 --> 00:25:51,044
or even kidnapping for ransom.

330
00:25:51,249 --> 00:25:55,185
Just simple kidnapping.
He'd get five years at most.

331
00:25:58,223 --> 00:25:59,781
This is no joke.

332
00:26:04,429 --> 00:26:09,628
I won't let him
laugh at me like this.

333
00:26:09,834 --> 00:26:13,668
Inspector, he's not just
after my money.

334
00:26:13,872 --> 00:26:18,002
He wants to humiliate me,
see me suffer,

335
00:26:18,710 --> 00:26:23,340
make me throw away
my hard-earned money!

336
00:26:23,682 --> 00:26:26,378
He wants to make
a laughingstock out of me.

337
00:26:26,851 --> 00:26:30,617
I'll say this loud and clear:
I won't let him. I won't pay.

338
00:26:31,723 --> 00:26:34,089
<i>I'll spell it out next time he calls.</i>

339
00:26:36,261 --> 00:26:38,320
No ransom! Never!

340
00:26:53,712 --> 00:26:56,408
Ow! Mom, that hurts.

341
00:26:57,916 --> 00:26:59,383
Put Jun to bed.

342
00:26:59,584 --> 00:27:02,917
I'm not sleepy.
I'll wait for Shinichi.

343
00:27:06,424 --> 00:27:11,657
He understands very well
what's happened.

344
00:27:12,397 --> 00:27:16,390
He feels responsible for it.

345
00:27:17,402 --> 00:27:20,371
I feel the same way.

346
00:27:20,572 --> 00:27:24,508
No one's responsible.
The man is a maniac!

347
00:27:26,244 --> 00:27:29,372
But Shinichi was kidnapped
in your son's place. That's why I...

348
00:27:29,581 --> 00:27:33,915
So you think
he should pay the ransom?

349
00:27:34,152 --> 00:27:36,985
You know the position
Mr. Gondo is in.

350
00:27:37,188 --> 00:27:42,148
But he was willing
to pay for his own son.

351
00:27:42,627 --> 00:27:44,288
He said he could raise
more money later.

352
00:27:44,496 --> 00:27:47,021
How? From where?

353
00:27:49,200 --> 00:27:51,862
He's mortgaged everything.

354
00:27:52,704 --> 00:27:56,367
He couldn't raise more money
to save his own life.

355
00:27:56,574 --> 00:27:59,236
Giving 30 million
to a madman...

356
00:27:59,477 --> 00:28:01,240
That's enough!

357
00:28:10,388 --> 00:28:12,856
- Let's go to bed.
- But I...

358
00:28:13,058 --> 00:28:15,720
You don't have to sleep.
Just go to your room.

359
00:28:35,513 --> 00:28:37,105
Inspector.

360
00:28:38,750 --> 00:28:42,686
Can you guarantee
the boy's safety if Mr. Gondo pays?

361
00:28:44,956 --> 00:28:48,187
The boy may already be dead,

362
00:28:48,393 --> 00:28:50,418
or he may be killed afterwards.

363
00:28:50,628 --> 00:28:52,619
Then what's the sense
in paying?

364
00:28:52,831 --> 00:28:54,128
That's true.

365
00:28:54,399 --> 00:28:57,960
But if he's alive,
paying may make the difference.

366
00:28:58,203 --> 00:29:00,728
We can only hope it does.

367
00:29:04,075 --> 00:29:08,307
And what would
the kidnapper do if he isn't paid?

368
00:29:08,513 --> 00:29:10,777
Would he actually kill the boy?

369
00:29:12,117 --> 00:29:15,951
He seems intelligent,
from the way he talks.

370
00:29:16,454 --> 00:29:18,649
Killing a child
is a capital offense.

371
00:29:18,857 --> 00:29:22,657
I doubt he'd risk death
just because he wasn't paid.

372
00:29:22,861 --> 00:29:28,561
But as Mr. Gondo pointed out,
he seems obsessed.

373
00:29:29,434 --> 00:29:32,494
His cynical logic
betrays a sick mind.

374
00:29:33,304 --> 00:29:37,331
We must believe
he'll carry it through:

375
00:29:37,542 --> 00:29:41,137
If he's paid,
he'll return the child.

376
00:29:41,613 --> 00:29:45,811
If not, I'm afraid
he'll kill the child as threatened.

377
00:29:53,858 --> 00:29:56,088
This is a vicious case.

378
00:29:57,061 --> 00:30:00,087
I'll ask the chief to deploy
the special investigation unit.

379
00:30:00,298 --> 00:30:03,734
See what you can find out here.

380
00:30:08,640 --> 00:30:14,237
Mr. Gondo, please alert us
before answering this phone.

381
00:30:21,886 --> 00:30:25,913
What about me?
Am I still going to Osaka?

382
00:30:26,891 --> 00:30:28,916
If I am, I'd better hurry.

383
00:30:33,298 --> 00:30:37,325
Why are you hesitating?
What's there to think about?

384
00:30:37,535 --> 00:30:40,504
Pay the ransom and we're ruined.
It's that simple.

385
00:30:41,539 --> 00:30:42,801
Go.

386
00:30:48,012 --> 00:30:51,140
I'm going,
no matter who's calling.

387
00:30:51,349 --> 00:30:53,408
All right, go.

388
00:30:56,788 --> 00:30:58,619
Kawanishi, wait!

389
00:31:02,160 --> 00:31:04,151
Inspector!

390
00:31:07,799 --> 00:31:09,994
Keep him talking
longer this time.

391
00:31:10,201 --> 00:31:11,828
Upstairs phone, okay?

392
00:31:20,278 --> 00:31:22,872
Hello. This is Gondo.

393
00:31:23,648 --> 00:31:27,049
<i>The boy's fine.
I'll let him talk to you.</i>

394
00:31:27,252 --> 00:31:29,447
<i>Daddy? Are you there?</i>

395
00:31:29,654 --> 00:31:31,121
Shinichi!

396
00:31:34,459 --> 00:31:37,257
<i>Whether he lives or dies
depends on you.</i>

397
00:31:37,462 --> 00:31:39,930
<i>Think it over carefully.</i>

398
00:31:40,632 --> 00:31:42,964
<i>Good night, Mr. Gondo.</i>

399
00:31:49,140 --> 00:31:51,040
He got away again.

400
00:31:55,713 --> 00:31:58,705
Please save my son!

401
00:32:00,518 --> 00:32:05,717
Asking you to pay
that kind of money...

402
00:32:05,990 --> 00:32:10,518
Until I heard his voice,

403
00:32:11,029 --> 00:32:16,763
I just couldn't
bring myself to do it.

404
00:32:16,968 --> 00:32:19,459
But now I'm begging you.

405
00:32:20,605 --> 00:32:25,235
Once he's safe, the police
will get your money back.

406
00:32:25,710 --> 00:32:28,543
If you could just lend it
to me for now,

407
00:32:28,813 --> 00:32:33,375
I'll do everything you want
until the day I die.

408
00:32:34,018 --> 00:32:35,918
I'll make Shinichi work too.
Anything you want.

409
00:32:36,120 --> 00:32:39,886
Stop it! Get up!
Damn it, stand up!

410
00:32:40,091 --> 00:32:41,524
Please save Shinichi!

411
00:32:41,726 --> 00:32:43,990
Stand up!
Please, stop it!

412
00:32:45,063 --> 00:32:50,296
I want to pay, but I can't.
You don't understand.

413
00:32:50,501 --> 00:32:52,765
I'm going, all right?

414
00:32:53,438 --> 00:32:54,928
Wait.

415
00:32:57,942 --> 00:33:00,877
Get up.
Please get up.

416
00:33:01,079 --> 00:33:05,277
He won't let your son die.

417
00:33:05,516 --> 00:33:08,883
I'll ask on your behalf.
Put your mind at ease.

418
00:33:09,087 --> 00:33:10,987
It'll be all right.

419
00:33:15,226 --> 00:33:16,989
Isn't Shinichi back yet?

420
00:33:21,899 --> 00:33:23,799
Postpone Osaka until tomorrow.

421
00:33:24,002 --> 00:33:25,902
I said we'll wait!

422
00:33:34,712 --> 00:33:37,943
Then I'll return this
for the time being.

423
00:33:52,797 --> 00:33:55,493
Excuse me. I'm tired.

424
00:34:31,536 --> 00:34:35,438
<i>Pardon me, but could you
keep the curtains closed?</i>

425
00:34:35,640 --> 00:34:37,232
Oh, sorry.

426
00:34:44,916 --> 00:34:46,781
You all slept here?

427
00:34:46,984 --> 00:34:49,111
No, the Bos'n and I...

428
00:34:49,320 --> 00:34:50,617
Bos'n?

429
00:34:51,789 --> 00:34:54,053
Bos'n is head
of the detective squad.

430
00:34:55,059 --> 00:34:59,860
In Yokohama, much of our work
is connected with the harbor.

431
00:35:00,064 --> 00:35:02,965
"Bos'n" fits him perfectly.
He's a real slave driver.

432
00:35:03,167 --> 00:35:05,465
He dragged me out
all last night.

433
00:35:05,670 --> 00:35:08,696
You're the one
who dragged me out.

434
00:35:08,906 --> 00:35:11,204
Sneaking over walls,

435
00:35:11,409 --> 00:35:15,573
hiding until morning, not knowing
if we're detectives or thieves.

436
00:35:18,583 --> 00:35:21,211
Last night the chief
set up a special investigation.

437
00:35:21,419 --> 00:35:26,652
We can use the whole
prefectural police force.

438
00:35:26,858 --> 00:35:32,091
Also, though the kidnapper
claims it isn't extortion,

439
00:35:32,296 --> 00:35:36,460
he's driven you into a corner.

440
00:35:36,667 --> 00:35:43,072
He's exploiting your suffering,
and that's "kidnapping for gain."

441
00:35:43,274 --> 00:35:46,266
It's a maximum
of 15 years' imprisonment.

442
00:35:47,411 --> 00:35:50,312
His being in prison
won't stop me from going under.

443
00:35:52,049 --> 00:35:54,643
His deadline is today.

444
00:35:56,354 --> 00:35:59,187
I thought it over all night.

445
00:36:00,158 --> 00:36:01,955
This is my decision.

446
00:36:10,902 --> 00:36:17,000
The boy's father wants me
to lend him the money.

447
00:36:17,842 --> 00:36:21,801
He says once his boy's safe,
you'll get my money back.

448
00:36:22,680 --> 00:36:28,312
But even if you guarantee me that,
I won't pay the ransom.

449
00:36:28,920 --> 00:36:31,047
I'd get it back too late.

450
00:36:31,822 --> 00:36:37,783
Without that money now,
I'll lose everything.

451
00:36:38,796 --> 00:36:40,195
Please understand me.

452
00:36:40,398 --> 00:36:44,562
This is who I am.
My work is a part of me.

453
00:36:45,203 --> 00:36:47,569
I'd be as good as dead
without it.

454
00:36:50,408 --> 00:36:55,539
You may think it's heartless,
but I refuse to pay.

455
00:36:58,883 --> 00:37:00,714
<i>That's not true.</i>

456
00:37:00,918 --> 00:37:02,977
I know he'll pay.

457
00:37:03,187 --> 00:37:04,711
Just stop it.

458
00:37:05,056 --> 00:37:09,618
I won't... no, I can't pay,
no matter what you say.

459
00:37:09,827 --> 00:37:12,728
I told you why last night,
yet still you persist.

460
00:37:13,564 --> 00:37:16,692
Listen: You know
what'll happen if I pay?

461
00:37:16,901 --> 00:37:19,199
I'll be penniless...
no, worse.

462
00:37:19,403 --> 00:37:23,339
I'll be saddled with debt
and forced out of the firm.

463
00:37:25,509 --> 00:37:29,775
You'll be all right.
You can start over.

464
00:37:30,014 --> 00:37:32,676
You don't know
the first thing about poverty.

465
00:37:33,451 --> 00:37:37,581
From the day you were born
you've had big houses and cars,

466
00:37:37,788 --> 00:37:39,847
servants tending
to your every whim.

467
00:37:40,057 --> 00:37:42,321
Your whole life has been luxury.

468
00:37:44,095 --> 00:37:46,893
Maybe I could start over,
but you... never!

469
00:37:48,032 --> 00:37:51,661
Yes, I could.
I don't care about luxury.

470
00:37:51,869 --> 00:37:54,030
It's all you've ever known.

471
00:37:54,238 --> 00:37:57,605
That's why you can tell me
to pay 30 million yen.

472
00:37:57,808 --> 00:38:01,972
It means nothing to you.
You're spoiled.

473
00:38:02,713 --> 00:38:04,578
It's not that.

474
00:38:04,782 --> 00:38:07,615
Don't you feel anything
for poor Aoki?

475
00:38:07,818 --> 00:38:12,346
Of course! It takes all my strength
not to cave in to his begging.

476
00:38:13,157 --> 00:38:15,318
I'd pay in a second
if I could.

477
00:38:15,526 --> 00:38:19,428
But I can't sacrifice
everything for him.

478
00:38:19,697 --> 00:38:24,259
There's you, and Jun,
and my own survival.

479
00:38:25,069 --> 00:38:26,730
This is ridiculous!

480
00:38:27,238 --> 00:38:30,765
There are plenty of people
richer than I am. Why me?

481
00:38:30,975 --> 00:38:32,533
And at a time like this!

482
00:38:32,743 --> 00:38:36,736
It would be suicide to pay.
Why should I?

483
00:38:39,617 --> 00:38:41,482
I know.

484
00:38:42,887 --> 00:38:46,186
But there's no other choice.

485
00:38:47,291 --> 00:38:50,454
Aoki has nobody
to ask but you.

486
00:38:51,162 --> 00:38:54,290
I'm asking too.
So is Jun.

487
00:38:54,498 --> 00:38:59,959
Enough! Nobody has the right
to ask this of me.

488
00:39:02,073 --> 00:39:05,941
That's final.
I'm not paying any ransom.

489
00:39:15,986 --> 00:39:18,250
Kawanishi, you're just in time.

490
00:39:18,622 --> 00:39:20,783
Take this check
and get to Osaka.

491
00:39:23,794 --> 00:39:27,491
Well, I've been thinking it over.

492
00:39:27,698 --> 00:39:30,565
- What?
- About that check.

493
00:39:31,235 --> 00:39:35,365
Whether I should take it or not.

494
00:39:36,407 --> 00:39:38,875
You said there was nothing
to think about!

495
00:39:39,710 --> 00:39:42,178
Well, I was confused.

496
00:39:43,347 --> 00:39:45,611
But just hear me out.

497
00:39:47,151 --> 00:39:50,643
If I go to Osaka
and close this deal,

498
00:39:50,855 --> 00:39:52,720
you'll take over
National Shoes.

499
00:39:53,624 --> 00:39:58,061
But you'd be hated by the public
for sacrificing a child!

500
00:39:59,130 --> 00:40:02,429
You'd be ruined.
No one would buy your shoes.

501
00:40:02,666 --> 00:40:05,794
That's enough!
You're not paid to think!

502
00:40:06,003 --> 00:40:07,698
Stop arguing and go.

503
00:40:07,905 --> 00:40:10,305
Please think this through.

504
00:40:11,442 --> 00:40:14,434
Think how
Mrs. Gondo must feel.

505
00:40:18,849 --> 00:40:24,344
After all, wasn't her dowry
the basis of your fortune?

506
00:40:25,222 --> 00:40:27,952
She has a say in this,

507
00:40:28,159 --> 00:40:29,820
and she wants you to pay.

508
00:40:30,027 --> 00:40:31,961
And destroy myself?

509
00:40:32,163 --> 00:40:35,724
I know how much
this money means to you.

510
00:40:36,867 --> 00:40:39,461
But a human life means more.

511
00:40:39,670 --> 00:40:42,468
We're talking
about a helpless child...

512
00:40:43,040 --> 00:40:45,804
"Human life"?
"Helpless child"?

513
00:40:46,477 --> 00:40:49,173
I've never heard such words
from your lips.

514
00:40:49,380 --> 00:40:53,749
What happened
to the cold-blooded businessman?

515
00:40:54,318 --> 00:40:56,650
When were you reborn?

516
00:40:58,222 --> 00:41:00,213
What happened
after you left last night?

517
00:41:00,424 --> 00:41:03,154
Nothing happened. I just...

518
00:41:05,062 --> 00:41:10,329
If my takeover succeeds,
you'll be made a director.

519
00:41:11,235 --> 00:41:15,672
Knowing that, you were ready
to go last night,

520
00:41:15,873 --> 00:41:19,309
arguing with Reiko, bad-mouthing
the cops, even pestering me.

521
00:41:20,611 --> 00:41:23,876
Yet today...

522
00:41:24,148 --> 00:41:26,173
You want to sabotage
my takeover, don't you?

523
00:41:26,383 --> 00:41:27,975
No. I just...

524
00:41:28,185 --> 00:41:32,281
Answer me! If I pay the ransom,
the deal goes up in smoke.

525
00:41:32,957 --> 00:41:34,948
That's what you want!

526
00:41:36,827 --> 00:41:38,795
What are you up to?

527
00:41:40,164 --> 00:41:42,223
Shall I answer for you?

528
00:41:42,700 --> 00:41:44,895
If this deal fails, so do I,

529
00:41:45,102 --> 00:41:47,297
and three men stand to celebrate.

530
00:41:48,305 --> 00:41:52,002
Bastard, you sold me out
to those three, didn't you?

531
00:41:54,778 --> 00:41:55,767
Yes.

532
00:41:55,980 --> 00:41:58,312
- You told them about Osaka?
- Everything.

533
00:41:58,516 --> 00:42:00,279
Worthless scum!

534
00:42:01,118 --> 00:42:06,522
Maybe I am.
But let me have my say.

535
00:42:07,358 --> 00:42:09,849
You weakened last night...

536
00:42:10,060 --> 00:42:13,496
enough to pay the ransom.

537
00:42:14,632 --> 00:42:18,659
What would happen to me then?
If I stake my life on you, I have nothing.

538
00:42:19,069 --> 00:42:22,971
You'd be selling out
your loyal servant of 10 years.

539
00:42:23,807 --> 00:42:26,833
What I did was self-defense.

540
00:42:27,044 --> 00:42:28,739
Get out!

541
00:42:29,747 --> 00:42:30,941
I'll go.

542
00:42:32,416 --> 00:42:35,977
<i>But you'll be the next
to hear those very words.</i>

543
00:42:36,186 --> 00:42:39,383
Baba and the Old Man
are talking as we speak.

544
00:42:39,623 --> 00:42:44,424
But I still have this,
so I can still kick you all out.

545
00:42:44,662 --> 00:42:46,562
I wonder.

546
00:42:47,064 --> 00:42:51,091
Maybe the kidnapper's right.
You don't have the guts to let him die.

547
00:42:51,302 --> 00:42:53,827
Get out!

548
00:43:18,796 --> 00:43:20,525
Mr. Gondo.

549
00:43:21,966 --> 00:43:24,958
I know it's late
to be saying this...

550
00:43:26,270 --> 00:43:30,468
but you have the right
to protect your own livelihood.

551
00:43:31,575 --> 00:43:34,305
It's our duty to help you.

552
00:43:35,012 --> 00:43:38,675
We want to save the child,

553
00:43:38,949 --> 00:43:41,645
but not by sacrificing you.

554
00:43:43,587 --> 00:43:47,148
Still, we hope
you'll do one thing:

555
00:43:47,391 --> 00:43:51,054
When the kidnapper calls,
say you'll pay.

556
00:43:51,295 --> 00:43:53,388
You only have
to say the words.

557
00:43:53,597 --> 00:43:57,124
Just ask him when and where.

558
00:43:58,669 --> 00:44:01,763
We'll take it from there.

559
00:44:08,245 --> 00:44:10,145
Forgive me, boss.

560
00:44:10,514 --> 00:44:14,245
I didn't realize how unreasonable
my request was.

561
00:44:14,451 --> 00:44:18,581
Please don't worry
about Shinichi.

562
00:44:21,291 --> 00:44:25,694
I think the kidnapper
was just bluffing.

563
00:44:26,497 --> 00:44:29,796
No human being
could kill an innocent child.

564
00:44:31,268 --> 00:44:34,863
Anyway, Shinichi
is a clever boy.

565
00:44:37,041 --> 00:44:40,306
I'm sure he'll find
a chance to escape.

566
00:45:26,890 --> 00:45:29,188
Where's Mr. Gondo?

567
00:45:34,965 --> 00:45:36,592
<i>Mr. Gondo!</i>

568
00:45:38,135 --> 00:45:40,228
<i>Phone! Hurry!</i>

569
00:45:58,188 --> 00:46:00,816
Hello. This is Gondo.

570
00:46:01,391 --> 00:46:04,758
<i>Mr. Gondo, you're not
up to any tricks, are you?</i>

571
00:46:05,429 --> 00:46:06,418
What do you mean?

572
00:46:06,630 --> 00:46:10,862
<i>Curtains closed in broad daylight.
A first time.</i>

573
00:46:11,468 --> 00:46:14,198
<i>- You can see us?
- Quite well.</i>

574
00:46:14,404 --> 00:46:17,532
<i>You're on a hilltop.</i>

575
00:46:17,741 --> 00:46:19,504
<i>It's hot as hell down here.</i>

576
00:46:19,710 --> 00:46:23,146
<i>An inferno.
Feels like 105 degrees.</i>

577
00:46:23,347 --> 00:46:26,282
<i>But you must be nice and cool
with your air- conditioning.</i>

578
00:46:27,151 --> 00:46:31,485
<i>I understand the closed windows,
but why the drapes?</i>

579
00:46:31,688 --> 00:46:33,417
<i>What are you up to?</i>

580
00:46:35,025 --> 00:46:36,652
Nothing.

581
00:46:37,795 --> 00:46:39,626
<i>Nothing?</i>

582
00:46:40,531 --> 00:46:44,592
<i>People always say that
when they're up to something.</i>

583
00:46:47,604 --> 00:46:49,902
Then I'll open the drapes
and prove it to you.

584
00:47:00,384 --> 00:47:03,114
<i>Good. I can see you now.</i>

585
00:47:03,320 --> 00:47:06,153
<i>Your wife, the chauffeur.</i>

586
00:47:06,356 --> 00:47:08,847
<i>Just the three of you?</i>

587
00:47:10,394 --> 00:47:11,725
That's right.

588
00:47:12,296 --> 00:47:14,526
<i>Well, then, let's continue.</i>

589
00:47:14,765 --> 00:47:17,359
<i>Have you decided to pay,
Mr. Gondo?</i>

590
00:47:20,604 --> 00:47:21,866
I have no choice.
I'll pay.

591
00:47:23,907 --> 00:47:26,501
<i>And is the money ready?</i>

592
00:47:27,277 --> 00:47:31,236
It will be by evening.
But only if the boy's unharmed.

593
00:47:31,448 --> 00:47:34,315
<i>- You heard him.
- No, I want to see him.</i>

594
00:47:35,586 --> 00:47:38,487
<i>- And if I refuse?
- I won't pay. That's final.</i>

595
00:47:38,689 --> 00:47:40,919
<i>Sounds fishy.</i>

596
00:47:42,893 --> 00:47:46,590
<i>Well, I'll think it over,
Mr. Gondo.</i>

597
00:47:59,810 --> 00:48:01,175
Stay there!

598
00:48:01,712 --> 00:48:05,113
Be careful!
The kidnapper's watching.

599
00:48:05,315 --> 00:48:07,283
Damn.

600
00:48:08,118 --> 00:48:11,519
Just a little longer
and I could've traced it.

601
00:48:17,761 --> 00:48:20,696
Thank you, Mr. Gondo.

602
00:48:21,398 --> 00:48:25,357
By saying you'd pay,
you bought us more time.

603
00:48:26,003 --> 00:48:29,962
Your demand was also
very helpful.

604
00:48:30,374 --> 00:48:34,174
If he accepts it,
we can formulate a plan.

605
00:48:50,527 --> 00:48:52,586
Bank of Tokyo?

606
00:48:53,864 --> 00:48:57,630
This is Gondo of National Shoes.
The branch manager, please.

607
00:49:00,170 --> 00:49:01,728
Yes, hello.

608
00:49:01,939 --> 00:49:06,501
This is short notice.
Send over 30 million yen in cash.

609
00:49:08,111 --> 00:49:11,478
No new bills,
and no consecutive numbers.

610
00:49:11,682 --> 00:49:13,809
Sorry to trouble you,

611
00:49:14,017 --> 00:49:16,247
but I need
one thousand 10,000 notes,

612
00:49:17,220 --> 00:49:19,188
three thousand 5,000 notes,

613
00:49:19,389 --> 00:49:21,914
and five thousand 1,000 notes.

614
00:49:22,125 --> 00:49:24,855
Yes, right away.

615
00:49:25,329 --> 00:49:26,956
Thank you.

616
00:49:32,803 --> 00:49:34,532
That's enough.
Don't say anything.

617
00:49:44,781 --> 00:49:47,181
I don't know what to say.

618
00:49:47,784 --> 00:49:49,945
Enough.
Leave me alone.

619
00:50:04,167 --> 00:50:07,796
- What is it?
- Mom's crying.

620
00:50:25,522 --> 00:50:28,184
<i>Hello. This is Gondo.</i>

621
00:50:28,658 --> 00:50:31,821
<i>Mr. Gondo, you're not
up to any tricks, are you?</i>

622
00:50:34,898 --> 00:50:38,356
I hear a coin dropping.

623
00:50:38,568 --> 00:50:41,332
Check all the pay phones
in this area.

624
00:50:44,041 --> 00:50:48,273
The kidnapper's right.
One case holds 15 million yen.

625
00:50:50,747 --> 00:50:52,977
What a sight, eh?

626
00:50:57,888 --> 00:51:00,823
<i>Hello. This is Gondo.</i>

627
00:51:01,024 --> 00:51:02,582
<i>Got the money?</i>

628
00:51:03,460 --> 00:51:04,757
<i>Yes, but...</i>

629
00:51:04,961 --> 00:51:08,590
<i>I accept your condition.
You'll see the boy first.</i>

630
00:51:08,799 --> 00:51:10,528
<i>- When?
- Tomorrow.</i>

631
00:51:10,734 --> 00:51:12,827
<i>We'll swap the boy
for the money.</i>

632
00:51:13,036 --> 00:51:14,196
<i>Where?</i>

633
00:51:14,471 --> 00:51:18,032
<i>Calm down and listen carefully.</i>

634
00:51:20,243 --> 00:51:23,770
<i>Get two briefcases,
less than 2. 75 inches thick.</i>

635
00:51:24,014 --> 00:51:26,380
<i>The money should Just barely fit.</i>

636
00:51:26,583 --> 00:51:30,075
<i>Close them tight but don't lock them:
I want ready access.</i>

637
00:51:30,987 --> 00:51:35,583
<i>Take them on tomorrow's
Kodama No. 2 express train.</i>

638
00:51:36,560 --> 00:51:39,791
<i>Understood? That's all.
- Where am I going?</i>

639
00:51:39,996 --> 00:51:42,829
<i>Get on and you'll see,
Mr. Gondo.</i>

640
00:51:48,972 --> 00:51:50,633
Bos'n,

641
00:51:50,841 --> 00:51:55,244
I doubt he's dumb enough
to make the exchange on the train.

642
00:51:56,546 --> 00:51:58,173
Will he try a station?

643
00:51:58,415 --> 00:52:02,408
That's risky, too.
I wouldn't try it if I were him.

644
00:52:05,122 --> 00:52:09,081
Two briefcases
under 2.75 inches thick.

645
00:52:10,594 --> 00:52:12,289
What's that all about?

646
00:52:12,496 --> 00:52:15,863
"Get on and you'll see."
Shit.

647
00:52:19,669 --> 00:52:21,364
By the way, Bos'n...

648
00:52:22,873 --> 00:52:25,603
where should we hide these
in the cases?

649
00:52:26,042 --> 00:52:29,102
That's not a job for amateurs.
I'll call a specialist.

650
00:52:29,980 --> 00:52:32,005
What do you need?

651
00:52:34,384 --> 00:52:39,117
We want to find him
with these briefcases.

652
00:52:39,656 --> 00:52:43,456
We intentionally chose
an unusual style.

653
00:52:43,894 --> 00:52:47,955
They're so conspicuous,
he'll have to get rid of them.

654
00:52:48,698 --> 00:52:52,725
He'll have to bury them,
sink them, or burn them.

655
00:52:54,404 --> 00:52:56,565
If the powder
in this capsule gets wet,

656
00:52:56,773 --> 00:52:59,640
it gives off
a putrid smell.

657
00:53:00,844 --> 00:53:06,077
The powder in this pouch
emits a pink smoke when burnt.

658
00:53:07,517 --> 00:53:09,508
It's not much to go on,

659
00:53:09,719 --> 00:53:12,813
but it just might
give us a lead.

660
00:53:23,733 --> 00:53:25,928
Reiko!

661
00:53:28,171 --> 00:53:32,733
Would you find
my old tool kit for me?

662
00:53:36,513 --> 00:53:40,677
How long to record
just the 1,000-yen notes?

663
00:53:40,951 --> 00:53:45,718
At ten a minute,
that's 5,000 in 500 minutes.

664
00:53:46,089 --> 00:53:51,356
That's eight hours, 20 minutes.
Ten hours with breaks.

665
00:53:51,995 --> 00:53:55,624
Isn't that a waste of time?
I never notice serial numbers.

666
00:53:55,832 --> 00:53:59,029
We can't neglect
any possible means of finding him.

667
00:54:00,270 --> 00:54:04,900
When the boy's back safely,
I'll flush that rat out.

668
00:54:05,609 --> 00:54:08,077
I'd burn him alive.

669
00:54:08,311 --> 00:54:11,803
Fifteen years maximum?
To hell with that!

670
00:54:25,195 --> 00:54:28,187
The capsule should go here,

671
00:54:29,132 --> 00:54:32,158
and the pouch goes there.

672
00:54:48,418 --> 00:54:52,616
In the old days,
shoemakers made cases too.

673
00:54:54,557 --> 00:54:57,890
My training as an apprentice
comes in handy once again.

674
00:55:00,196 --> 00:55:02,391
It's like I'm starting over
already.

675
00:55:28,591 --> 00:55:30,991
He's really something.

676
00:55:31,428 --> 00:55:35,296
I waste no love on the rich,
since I grew up poor.

677
00:55:35,632 --> 00:55:38,897
At first I despised him,
but now...

678
00:55:47,210 --> 00:55:48,973
Excuse me.

679
00:55:55,652 --> 00:55:58,280
THE BO Y'S NOT ON THE TRAIN

680
00:56:06,062 --> 00:56:08,223
This isn't a pleasure trip.

681
00:56:28,685 --> 00:56:31,552
<i>Railway Telephone Service</i>

682
00:56:31,755 --> 00:56:37,694
<i>paging Mr. Kingo Gondo
of National Shoes.</i>

683
00:56:37,894 --> 00:56:42,263
<i>Please take your call
in the buffet car phone booth.</i>

684
00:56:53,576 --> 00:56:55,806
- It's the kidnapper.
- What do we do?

685
00:56:56,846 --> 00:56:59,974
<i>The next stop is Atami.
Will they do the switch there?</i>

686
00:57:01,418 --> 00:57:03,010
Go get some coffee.

687
00:57:11,027 --> 00:57:12,358
I'm Mr. Gondo.

688
00:57:18,234 --> 00:57:19,166
Coffee.

689
00:57:28,077 --> 00:57:30,011
We just passed Kozu.

690
00:57:30,213 --> 00:57:31,612
<i>Perfect.</i>

691
00:57:31,815 --> 00:57:33,180
<i>Listen carefully.</i>

692
00:57:33,383 --> 00:57:36,147
<i>You'll cross
the Sakawa River in two minutes.</i>

693
00:57:36,352 --> 00:57:38,786
<i>You'll see him
at the foot of the bridge.</i>

694
00:57:51,734 --> 00:57:52,996
Coffee.

695
00:58:11,988 --> 00:58:14,252
<i>The boy's at the foot
of the next bridge.</i>

696
00:58:14,457 --> 00:58:16,755
I'm to toss the money
at the other side.

697
00:58:16,960 --> 00:58:18,359
These windows don't open.

698
00:58:18,561 --> 00:58:20,791
He said the washroom windows
open 2.75 inches.

699
00:58:22,832 --> 00:58:24,959
Son of a bitch!
That explains it!

700
00:58:25,401 --> 00:58:29,531
There's no stop until Atami.
He'll get away clean.

701
00:58:29,739 --> 00:58:33,607
The bastard thought of everything.
A real monster.

702
00:58:34,878 --> 00:58:38,006
An emergency stop
would endanger the boy.

703
00:58:39,582 --> 00:58:43,211
He's got us from every angle.

704
00:58:43,419 --> 00:58:47,321
There must be two of them:
One with the kid, one to grab the money.

705
00:58:47,557 --> 00:58:50,549
We'll get a glimpse.
Which side is the boy on?

706
00:58:50,760 --> 00:58:53,695
- The left.
- You'll toss the cases from here?

707
00:58:53,897 --> 00:58:56,457
Yes, from the washroom window.

708
00:58:56,666 --> 00:58:59,464
We'll confirm it's the boy
from here.

709
00:58:59,669 --> 00:59:01,398
You all split up
to take pictures.

710
00:59:01,604 --> 00:59:06,940
Still photos on the left,
8mm in the front and rear.

711
00:59:11,047 --> 00:59:14,983
The bridge is coming up.
Get a good look at the boy.

712
00:59:15,184 --> 00:59:19,120
I only know him from photos.
It could be a switch.

713
00:59:19,322 --> 00:59:21,813
Don't worry. I'm trading
my life for that boy.

714
00:59:22,025 --> 00:59:23,720
I won't make a mistake.

715
01:00:17,947 --> 01:00:19,676
Shinichi!

716
01:00:20,750 --> 01:00:22,047
Are you sure?

717
01:01:38,361 --> 01:01:40,829
We can't rest
until we find that kidnapper.

718
01:01:41,030 --> 01:01:44,124
For Mr. Gondo's sake,
be bloodhounds.

719
01:01:55,244 --> 01:01:57,212
Can you see
inside the living room?

720
01:01:57,413 --> 01:02:00,177
This is the best view so far.

721
01:02:02,218 --> 01:02:04,413
He may live around here.

722
01:02:04,620 --> 01:02:08,112
But would he use a phone
this close to home?

723
01:02:08,357 --> 01:02:10,086
<i>Let's try the next one.</i>

724
01:02:17,567 --> 01:02:22,027
The kidnapper's right.
That house gets on your nerves.

725
01:02:22,572 --> 01:02:25,439
As if it's looking down at us.

726
01:03:43,586 --> 01:03:46,987
CLEVER KIDNAPPER
USES EXPRESS TRAIN

727
01:03:49,692 --> 01:03:52,820
RANSOM FOR DRIVER'S SON
IS 30 MILLION YEN

728
01:03:53,029 --> 01:03:56,590
SHOE EXEC THROWS ENTIRE
FORTUNE OUT THE WINDOW

729
01:04:00,002 --> 01:04:03,597
ALL POLICE UNITS MOBILIZED

730
01:04:11,013 --> 01:04:16,417
<i>Police say money was not
the kidnapper's only motive.</i>

731
01:04:16,719 --> 01:04:20,917
<i>His phone calls
have a taunting tone,</i>

732
01:04:21,123 --> 01:04:25,560
<i>suggesting extraordinary
hatred for Mr. Gondo.</i>

733
01:04:25,862 --> 01:04:28,990
<i>The kidnapper wanted
not only to steal money,</i>

734
01:04:29,198 --> 01:04:33,032
<i>but also to torment and ridicule
Mr. Gondo in the process.</i>

735
01:04:33,236 --> 01:04:37,297
<i>Yet Gondo's sacrifice
has not gone unnoticed.</i>

736
01:04:37,506 --> 01:04:43,536
<i>Words of sympathy have grown
into national acclaim for him.</i>

737
01:04:43,746 --> 01:04:45,839
<i>How will the kidnapper
react to this?</i>

738
01:04:46,082 --> 01:04:50,109
<i>If he's listening,
I'll tell him this:</i>

739
01:04:50,319 --> 01:04:53,777
<i>Mr. Gondo is having
the last laugh!</i>

740
01:05:24,420 --> 01:05:26,513
We learned from Shinichi

741
01:05:26,722 --> 01:05:29,350
that a woman held him.

742
01:05:29,558 --> 01:05:33,756
Unfortunately, hats hid the faces
of both the man and the woman,

743
01:05:33,963 --> 01:05:37,399
making identification impossible.

744
01:05:37,600 --> 01:05:41,696
But their movements
may provide important clues.

745
01:05:41,904 --> 01:05:43,963
Watch carefully.

746
01:05:59,055 --> 01:06:00,386
Well?

747
01:06:00,589 --> 01:06:04,821
Any idea who they may be?

748
01:06:08,531 --> 01:06:11,796
Don't hesitate to say
if you have any idea.

749
01:06:13,536 --> 01:06:16,437
Delivery boys, milkmen,

750
01:06:16,639 --> 01:06:19,039
gardeners,
junk collectors, salesmen.

751
01:06:19,275 --> 01:06:23,234
Try to remember everyone
who's come through here.

752
01:06:27,416 --> 01:06:29,816
This kind of thing
might come to you suddenly.

753
01:06:30,019 --> 01:06:32,180
Take your time.

754
01:06:35,958 --> 01:06:40,725
Bos'n, the 8mm films are well shot,
but not much help yet.

755
01:06:40,930 --> 01:06:45,299
The figure is blurred in the photos,
but they're helpful.

756
01:06:46,168 --> 01:06:48,363
Look at this.

757
01:06:53,476 --> 01:06:55,307
This is the accomplice.

758
01:06:56,545 --> 01:07:01,448
See this tiny figure here?
That's a farmer leading a cow.

759
01:07:02,485 --> 01:07:04,885
He gave us
some useful information.

760
01:07:05,087 --> 01:07:09,148
He saw a man with two briefcases
run into the shadows here

761
01:07:09,492 --> 01:07:12,222
and then drive off.

762
01:07:12,595 --> 01:07:17,328
We checked the area
and found skid marks.

763
01:07:17,533 --> 01:07:20,627
It seems he ran
into a concrete railing,

764
01:07:20,836 --> 01:07:22,667
leaving behind paint scrapings.

765
01:07:23,372 --> 01:07:27,866
By having them checked,
we determined the following:

766
01:07:29,111 --> 01:07:32,512
The car was
a gray '59 Toyopet Crown.

767
01:07:33,949 --> 01:07:36,816
This is the car you rode in,
isn't it?

768
01:07:38,754 --> 01:07:39,948
Yes.

769
01:07:41,824 --> 01:07:43,724
- Can we go?
- Sure.

770
01:07:45,061 --> 01:07:48,724
Shinichi, try harder
to remember everything.

771
01:07:49,799 --> 01:07:53,633
You were at a house with a view
of the sea and Mt. Fuji?

772
01:07:55,037 --> 01:07:58,632
What road did the car take
from there to the river?

773
01:07:59,542 --> 01:08:02,409
- I don't remember.
- Try harder, damn it!

774
01:08:03,079 --> 01:08:04,842
What did you see
from the car window?

775
01:08:07,283 --> 01:08:08,511
Lots of things.

776
01:08:08,751 --> 01:08:10,378
That's not good enough!

777
01:08:11,487 --> 01:08:15,082
I'm asking you to try harder.
What did you see?

778
01:08:15,791 --> 01:08:17,452
- I can't...
- Shinichi!

779
01:08:17,660 --> 01:08:19,287
Aoki, stop this.

780
01:08:24,066 --> 01:08:27,866
When you remember, kiddo,
come tell us, okay?

781
01:08:35,878 --> 01:08:39,541
Mr. Aoki,
we know how you feel.

782
01:08:39,782 --> 01:08:42,046
We feel the same way.

783
01:08:42,718 --> 01:08:46,552
We're desperate to capture
the culprit and return the money.

784
01:08:48,290 --> 01:08:50,588
We owe Mr. Gondo
at least that much.

785
01:08:50,860 --> 01:08:52,691
<i>Guests, sir.</i>

786
01:08:54,697 --> 01:08:59,600
Anyway, Mr. Aoki,
go easier on the boy.

787
01:09:00,402 --> 01:09:02,495
Excuse me.

788
01:09:05,274 --> 01:09:09,142
Shinichi's already recalled
some key information.

789
01:09:09,812 --> 01:09:15,580
They covered his face
with gauze soaked in ether.

790
01:09:15,784 --> 01:09:18,378
He went to a house with a view
of Mt. Fuji and the sea.

791
01:09:21,957 --> 01:09:24,118
Well, that's all for today.

792
01:09:28,998 --> 01:09:30,989
Oh, one more thing.

793
01:09:31,333 --> 01:09:34,097
We've received
a mountain of mail.

794
01:09:34,336 --> 01:09:36,702
Mr. Gondo went through
a horrible experience,

795
01:09:36,906 --> 01:09:39,773
but everyone admires him.

796
01:09:40,309 --> 01:09:43,107
That lifts
our spirits a bit too.

797
01:09:43,345 --> 01:09:47,213
You're a hero, and the public
is very sympathetic,

798
01:09:47,416 --> 01:09:50,817
but what about
National Shoes?

799
01:09:51,320 --> 01:09:54,346
A battle for ownership
won't be pretty.

800
01:09:55,324 --> 01:09:59,954
We hear your position is shaky.

801
01:10:00,796 --> 01:10:02,491
Is that true?

802
01:10:02,698 --> 01:10:04,928
Frankly, we're worried.

803
01:10:05,134 --> 01:10:07,102
Sympathy costs nothing,

804
01:10:07,303 --> 01:10:12,138
but we've invested real money.
We have no sympathy for you.

805
01:10:12,541 --> 01:10:15,442
As your principal creditors,

806
01:10:15,644 --> 01:10:18,204
we've reached
a decision together.

807
01:10:18,814 --> 01:10:22,614
We're returning the interest
you sent yesterday

808
01:10:22,818 --> 01:10:27,050
to postpone
paying us the principal.

809
01:10:27,723 --> 01:10:30,783
Pay us in full
when it falls due.

810
01:10:30,993 --> 01:10:34,724
If you don't, we'll seize
your collateral property.

811
01:10:34,930 --> 01:10:38,889
Public opinion aside, Mr. Gondo,
you can't pay a kidnapper

812
01:10:39,101 --> 01:10:43,094
and leave us footing the bill.

813
01:11:06,128 --> 01:11:09,188
The Gondo residence is visible

814
01:11:09,431 --> 01:11:12,400
from Nishi Ward
and parts of Naka Ward.

815
01:11:12,601 --> 01:11:15,729
There are some places
where changes in elevation,

816
01:11:15,938 --> 01:11:22,173
trees, or large structures
block the view.

817
01:11:22,878 --> 01:11:27,338
Those locations
are shown with hatch lines.

818
01:11:27,549 --> 01:11:30,484
The Gondo living room
can be seen clearly

819
01:11:30,686 --> 01:11:34,417
with an ordinary telescope

820
01:11:34,723 --> 01:11:37,624
from any point within this circle.

821
01:11:38,227 --> 01:11:40,559
It can also be seen
from the inside

822
01:11:40,763 --> 01:11:44,756
of seven phone booths
within this perimeter.

823
01:11:45,534 --> 01:11:48,799
Those are indicated
by these X marks.

824
01:11:49,004 --> 01:11:52,098
Three of those seven
allow a good view

825
01:11:52,308 --> 01:11:55,300
even when using a telescope
while on the phone.

826
01:11:55,511 --> 01:12:00,175
Those are indicated
by these circled X marks.

827
01:12:00,516 --> 01:12:05,419
We believe the suspect used
one of these phones.

828
01:12:05,621 --> 01:12:10,388
He also complained
that it was very hot.

829
01:12:10,626 --> 01:12:14,357
He called
a little before 9:00 a.m.

830
01:12:14,563 --> 01:12:18,795
<i>We checked which booths receive
the most direct sunlight at that hour.</i>

831
01:12:19,001 --> 01:12:21,469
<i>Of these three,</i>

832
01:12:22,338 --> 01:12:24,772
this one is shaded
in the morning.

833
01:12:25,107 --> 01:12:28,076
So it is safe to assume

834
01:12:28,277 --> 01:12:31,769
that the suspect used
one of the other two.

835
01:12:32,214 --> 01:12:34,580
The recorded
conversations suggest

836
01:12:34,783 --> 01:12:38,879
he was looking through
the telescope while on the phone.

837
01:12:39,088 --> 01:12:41,648
So we can narrow down
his place of residence

838
01:12:41,857 --> 01:12:45,520
to this vicinity.

839
01:12:46,695 --> 01:12:51,632
Judging from his voice,
he's a young male.

840
01:12:51,900 --> 01:12:56,394
But with the boy he wore
a mask and dark glasses.

841
01:12:56,605 --> 01:12:58,732
Not much to go on there.

842
01:13:00,609 --> 01:13:04,739
<i>Next we have a report
on the railway phone.</i>

843
01:13:13,922 --> 01:13:20,020
You can only call the express train
from Tokyo, Osaka or Nagoya.

844
01:13:20,829 --> 01:13:26,790
The call is relayed by microwave,
but with a long delay,

845
01:13:27,002 --> 01:13:28,993
so it was easy to trace
the origin of the call.

846
01:13:30,406 --> 01:13:33,307
<i>Yurakucho 2-6,
Chiyoda Ward, Tokyo.</i>

847
01:13:33,976 --> 01:13:37,412
<i>A tobacco shop
near the train station.</i>

848
01:13:39,014 --> 01:13:43,348
But the old lady at the shop
had bad eyes

849
01:13:43,552 --> 01:13:45,247
and even worse hearing.

850
01:13:45,621 --> 01:13:47,384
It was hopeless.

851
01:13:47,589 --> 01:13:52,424
We asked around
at all the shops in the vicinity,

852
01:13:53,028 --> 01:13:56,122
but no one could recall

853
01:13:56,331 --> 01:14:00,267
a man placing a call
at the tobacco shop at that hour.

854
01:14:02,304 --> 01:14:03,737
<i>Next.</i>

855
01:14:06,141 --> 01:14:08,234
The boy mentioned
Mt. Fuji and the sea.

856
01:14:08,444 --> 01:14:10,776
Any leads?

857
01:14:15,684 --> 01:14:18,050
We had him draw a picture.

858
01:14:27,629 --> 01:14:31,292
The call with the boy
was a direct-dial local call.

859
01:14:31,834 --> 01:14:34,598
<i>Places with a view
of Mt. Fuji and the sea</i>

860
01:14:34,803 --> 01:14:37,033
<i>where you can call Yokohama
without an operator</i>

861
01:14:37,239 --> 01:14:42,074
<i>include Zushi, Fujisawa,
Chigasaki and part of Kamakura.</i>

862
01:14:43,312 --> 01:14:45,542
The sun in the picture
appears to be setting.

863
01:14:46,715 --> 01:14:50,412
This appears
all along the coast.

864
01:14:54,957 --> 01:14:56,584
<i>Next, the ether.</i>

865
01:15:00,529 --> 01:15:03,555
It's not easy
to trace back to a source.

866
01:15:04,299 --> 01:15:06,824
Pharmacies don't carry it.

867
01:15:07,202 --> 01:15:11,866
Hospitals and larger clinics
buy it wholesale.

868
01:15:12,441 --> 01:15:17,674
There is also industrial-grade ether,
used in welding.

869
01:15:18,614 --> 01:15:22,175
So it's too early
to say the suspect

870
01:15:22,384 --> 01:15:27,754
is a doctor, pharmacist,
or medical student.

871
01:15:28,423 --> 01:15:30,357
Industrial-grade ether is used

872
01:15:30,559 --> 01:15:34,427
<i>in building ships, railroad cars
and automobiles,</i>

873
01:15:34,630 --> 01:15:38,031
<i>as well as in small iron works</i>

874
01:15:38,233 --> 01:15:41,225
and repair shops.

875
01:15:41,603 --> 01:15:42,763
That's all.

876
01:15:45,307 --> 01:15:47,605
<i>Next, the car.</i>

877
01:15:52,814 --> 01:15:57,615
The farmer said it had white plates,
so it's privately owned.

878
01:15:57,819 --> 01:16:01,585
Crooks generally
don't use a family car,

879
01:16:01,790 --> 01:16:05,055
so I checked
on stolen vehicles.

880
01:16:06,395 --> 01:16:11,128
This month,
18 Toyopets were stolen.

881
01:16:11,333 --> 01:16:14,791
However, 12 were recovered
before the kidnapping.

882
01:16:15,470 --> 01:16:20,305
That leaves six. Only one is gray,
like our paint sample.

883
01:16:22,644 --> 01:16:27,672
It was stolen
the day before the kidnapping.

884
01:16:29,184 --> 01:16:30,708
The license number...

885
01:16:32,421 --> 01:16:35,083
is Kanagawa SO3059.

886
01:16:36,725 --> 01:16:39,353
<i>Since the plates
may have been changed,</i>

887
01:16:39,561 --> 01:16:44,624
<i>Vehicle Theft is checking
all gray '59 Toyopets on the road.</i>

888
01:16:45,834 --> 01:16:46,562
That's all.

889
01:16:46,768 --> 01:16:51,262
<i>Good.
Next, the 1000-yen notes.</i>

890
01:16:54,876 --> 01:17:00,337
We compiled a list
of serial numbers

891
01:17:00,549 --> 01:17:06,613
<i>for tobacco shops, cafeterias,
cafs and movie theaters.</i>

892
01:17:07,556 --> 01:17:11,356
Goodwill for Mr. Gondo
makes the owners eager to help,

893
01:17:11,560 --> 01:17:16,827
but none of the notes
have turned up yet.

894
01:17:18,634 --> 01:17:21,865
<i>Next, reports from the public.</i>

895
01:17:26,141 --> 01:17:31,875
We've received
1,305 reports of sightings,

896
01:17:32,681 --> 01:17:36,742
only a few of which
are from cranks.

897
01:17:37,219 --> 01:17:42,851
All reported seeing
men with boys of Shinichi's age,

898
01:17:43,558 --> 01:17:49,519
but many of the sightings
occurred before he was kidnapped

899
01:17:49,731 --> 01:17:52,199
or after he was recovered.

900
01:17:52,934 --> 01:17:57,064
And he was seen
at the same time

901
01:17:57,272 --> 01:18:01,709
in places far removed
from each other.

902
01:18:02,010 --> 01:18:04,570
We're trying
to corroborate the reports.

903
01:18:05,580 --> 01:18:09,448
One promising report
we received today

904
01:18:09,651 --> 01:18:12,142
was from a turnpike
toll collector.

905
01:18:12,354 --> 01:18:15,812
About 7:00 p.m.
The night of the kidnapping,

906
01:18:16,024 --> 01:18:19,255
a man in dark glasses
drove up.

907
01:18:19,461 --> 01:18:25,161
A boy was sleeping
under a blanket in the back seat.

908
01:18:25,667 --> 01:18:29,000
The car was dark.
He couldn't see the boy's face,

909
01:18:29,204 --> 01:18:34,301
but he did notice a toy rifle
and a cowboy hat.

910
01:18:35,544 --> 01:18:39,105
<i>The man was headed
toward Fujisawa.</i>

911
01:18:39,314 --> 01:18:42,613
This is our best lead so far.

912
01:18:42,818 --> 01:18:47,517
We're now reexamining
all reports from that area.

913
01:18:52,527 --> 01:18:54,995
<i>Next, the railway connection.</i>

914
01:18:57,766 --> 01:18:59,859
The Kodama train's infrastructure

915
01:19:00,068 --> 01:19:02,559
<i>is not that different
from other express trains.</i>

916
01:19:02,771 --> 01:19:06,207
<i>The suspect is very familiar
with the system,</i>

917
01:19:06,408 --> 01:19:08,899
<i>but that doesn't necessarily mean</i>

918
01:19:09,111 --> 01:19:10,772
<i>that he's a railroad man.</i>

919
01:19:10,979 --> 01:19:14,642
<i>We nonetheless ran a check
on all employees</i>

920
01:19:14,850 --> 01:19:17,648
<i>with connections
to express trains</i>

921
01:19:17,853 --> 01:19:20,515
who were absent
during the kidnapping

922
01:19:20,722 --> 01:19:23,589
or had quit just prior to it,

923
01:19:23,792 --> 01:19:28,957
and those living in view
of the Gondo home.

924
01:19:30,065 --> 01:19:34,661
There were very few.
I'll have a final report tomorrow.

925
01:19:35,904 --> 01:19:37,132
That's all.

926
01:19:38,240 --> 01:19:41,073
<i>Next, grudges or other motives.</i>

927
01:19:44,246 --> 01:19:47,773
I met today with
the National Shoes executives.

928
01:19:51,453 --> 01:19:54,547
What a bunch of assholes.

929
01:19:55,824 --> 01:19:58,019
A grudge?

930
01:19:58,360 --> 01:20:02,797
Inspector, you think
we were behind the kidnapping?

931
01:20:03,231 --> 01:20:07,463
Think we set it all up
to get rid of Gondo?

932
01:20:07,669 --> 01:20:12,971
That's absurd. We went that night
to join forces with him.

933
01:20:13,175 --> 01:20:15,939
On bended knee even.
- He almost did us in.

934
01:20:16,144 --> 01:20:21,104
We had no idea of his plans
until Kawanishi informed us.

935
01:20:21,349 --> 01:20:23,180
Serves him right.

936
01:20:23,618 --> 01:20:27,110
He was secretly buying stock
to take over the company.

937
01:20:27,489 --> 01:20:29,719
Then this incident
comes along and ruins him.

938
01:20:30,158 --> 01:20:32,592
I'd call it divine retribution.

939
01:20:35,197 --> 01:20:37,961
It's not that I doubt you,

940
01:20:38,400 --> 01:20:42,598
but you've known
Mr. Gondo a long time.

941
01:20:42,971 --> 01:20:46,065
I just wondered
if there was anyone

942
01:20:46,274 --> 01:20:49,243
who might have held
a grudge against him.

943
01:20:49,444 --> 01:20:51,105
Where should we start?

944
01:20:51,546 --> 01:20:53,514
We couldn't even
name them all.

945
01:20:56,117 --> 01:20:58,312
One more question.

946
01:20:58,820 --> 01:21:03,917
The kidnapping occurred
just after you left his home.

947
01:21:04,526 --> 01:21:08,121
Did you notice anything
near the gate?

948
01:21:08,630 --> 01:21:12,999
A car, for instance,
or a suspicious person?

949
01:21:13,235 --> 01:21:18,468
Look here! He'd just thrown us out.
We weren't admiring the view.

950
01:21:22,010 --> 01:21:24,478
They were no help.

951
01:21:25,247 --> 01:21:28,739
But at the factory...

952
01:21:29,417 --> 01:21:34,480
Mr. Gondo has
a sharp temper for sure,

953
01:21:35,023 --> 01:21:39,858
but he also cares a lot
about the work.

954
01:21:40,061 --> 01:21:43,258
He's an excellent boss
if you do a good job.

955
01:21:43,665 --> 01:21:47,226
I doubt anyone here

956
01:21:47,435 --> 01:21:50,165
holds a grudge against him,

957
01:21:50,405 --> 01:21:53,067
except maybe the front office.

958
01:21:54,910 --> 01:21:56,639
Here's what I think:

959
01:21:56,845 --> 01:22:01,179
Nobody holds a grudge
against Mr. Gondo...

960
01:22:02,384 --> 01:22:04,181
except the big shots.

961
01:22:04,386 --> 01:22:06,718
They'd give
the kidnapper a medal!

962
01:22:06,922 --> 01:22:09,288
Taguchi, calm down.

963
01:22:12,794 --> 01:22:18,255
Now for the results
of this meeting.

964
01:22:18,934 --> 01:22:20,458
Inspector Tokura.

965
01:22:28,443 --> 01:22:33,745
So far, this case seems
impossible to break.

966
01:22:34,616 --> 01:22:37,779
But the criminal
must be in these details.

967
01:22:37,986 --> 01:22:40,682
Follow every lead through
to the bitter end.

968
01:22:41,056 --> 01:22:45,493
It may be fruitless,
but when you're discouraged...

969
01:22:50,765 --> 01:22:53,632
think of what
Mr. Gondo's going through.

970
01:22:58,239 --> 01:23:00,901
Take the boy tomorrow

971
01:23:01,109 --> 01:23:02,770
for a drive along the shore.

972
01:23:02,978 --> 01:23:06,971
Cover every mile
until you find this view.

973
01:23:07,415 --> 01:23:11,078
If you can jog his memory,
you may find the hideout.

974
01:23:19,227 --> 01:23:20,751
It's Vehicle Theft.

975
01:23:24,366 --> 01:23:26,834
Tokura speaking.

976
01:23:29,304 --> 01:23:30,532
That's great news.

977
01:23:30,739 --> 01:23:35,642
We'll be right there.
Don't touch anything.

978
01:23:37,078 --> 01:23:38,841
They found the car.

979
01:23:39,080 --> 01:23:43,244
Abandoned on a highway.
Call the crime-scene unit.

980
01:23:44,486 --> 01:23:48,855
Have more men bunk at the station,
with the rest on call.

981
01:24:10,445 --> 01:24:13,505
It's spattered with mud,
but there's been no rain lately.

982
01:24:13,715 --> 01:24:17,515
It's actually dust
combined with splashed water.

983
01:24:43,745 --> 01:24:45,178
What's this?

984
01:24:45,914 --> 01:24:48,940
- What's wrong?
- Everybody listen to this.

985
01:24:55,590 --> 01:24:58,081
<i>Hello. This is Gondo.</i>

986
01:24:58,927 --> 01:25:02,419
<i>The boy's fine.
I'll let him talk to you.</i>

987
01:25:02,630 --> 01:25:04,962
<i>Daddy? Are you there?</i>

988
01:25:11,139 --> 01:25:13,767
Hear that trolley?

989
01:25:28,022 --> 01:25:29,216
So?

990
01:25:29,424 --> 01:25:32,621
A trolley passes
by the hideout.

991
01:25:33,228 --> 01:25:36,720
Three lines pass through Zushi,
Fujisawa, Chigasaki and Kamakura:

992
01:25:36,931 --> 01:25:40,059
The JR, Odayaku
and Enoshima lines.

993
01:25:40,268 --> 01:25:44,830
Each has a distinctive sound. Maybe
a specialist could tell which it is.

994
01:25:45,340 --> 01:25:46,739
I'll be back.

995
01:25:48,276 --> 01:25:50,471
Enoshima Rail?
You're sure?

996
01:25:50,678 --> 01:25:54,079
<i>You bet your boots.
I live right next to the tracks.</i>

997
01:25:54,282 --> 01:25:56,910
That sound

998
01:25:57,118 --> 01:25:59,313
isn't a pantograph trolley.

999
01:25:59,521 --> 01:26:03,890
It's an old-style,
single-pole trolley.

1000
01:26:04,092 --> 01:26:08,620
Only the Enoshima line
uses those old lines nowadays.

1001
01:26:09,097 --> 01:26:11,793
Plus, their line has
a lot of curves,

1002
01:26:12,000 --> 01:26:14,468
and they use short rails
with lots of joints.

1003
01:26:14,669 --> 01:26:18,264
Also, the wheelbase is narrow,
so it goes...

1004
01:26:20,175 --> 01:26:21,642
instead of...

1005
01:26:23,611 --> 01:26:25,238
Thank you very much.

1006
01:26:26,814 --> 01:26:28,509
Is Mr. Aoki in?

1007
01:26:28,716 --> 01:26:30,775
I'm sorry. He's out.

1008
01:26:30,985 --> 01:26:33,317
Is he at your husband's office?

1009
01:26:33,721 --> 01:26:35,052
No.

1010
01:26:39,060 --> 01:26:40,425
Where is he?

1011
01:26:40,628 --> 01:26:43,153
He took Shinichi for a drive.

1012
01:26:43,698 --> 01:26:48,863
He wants to jog Shinichi's memory
to help find the kidnapper.

1013
01:26:58,079 --> 01:27:00,377
He just won't let up, will he?

1014
01:27:00,582 --> 01:27:04,575
Give him a break.
He feels he has to do something.

1015
01:27:39,954 --> 01:27:41,979
You're sure
he let you out here?

1016
01:27:42,190 --> 01:27:44,590
- From which way?
- That way.

1017
01:27:46,261 --> 01:27:48,957
Watch carefully
out the back as we go.

1018
01:27:49,163 --> 01:27:52,428
Tell me
if you remember anything.

1019
01:28:04,112 --> 01:28:05,374
Now what?

1020
01:28:05,580 --> 01:28:08,378
We can't do anything
without the boy.

1021
01:28:08,583 --> 01:28:10,676
My guess is Aoki
will go to the Sakawa River.

1022
01:28:10,885 --> 01:28:12,750
Take the Tokaido Highway.

1023
01:28:21,829 --> 01:28:23,820
Daddy!

1024
01:28:24,032 --> 01:28:27,297
What?
Remember something?

1025
01:28:28,169 --> 01:28:30,160
I peed over there.

1026
01:28:36,811 --> 01:28:41,839
We're looking for Aoki. Once we have
the boy, we'll head for the shore.

1027
01:28:42,250 --> 01:28:45,549
<i>Hold on.
I Just got word from the lab.</i>

1028
01:28:45,753 --> 01:28:50,122
<i>There's a lot of fish blood
and oil on the stolen car.</i>

1029
01:28:50,325 --> 01:28:52,418
<i>They also found
mackerel scales and bonito.</i>

1030
01:28:52,627 --> 01:28:55,221
<i>That's what was splashed
on the hood of the car.</i>

1031
01:28:55,430 --> 01:28:59,332
<i>He drove through a lot of fish offal.</i>

1032
01:28:59,534 --> 01:29:02,901
<i>It must've been at a fish market.</i>

1033
01:29:03,104 --> 01:29:05,629
<i>The Koshigoe market
is the only one near that trolley.</i>

1034
01:29:05,840 --> 01:29:08,673
<i>Take a look over there.
We'll handle Aoki.</i>

1035
01:29:08,876 --> 01:29:10,434
Got it.

1036
01:29:18,786 --> 01:29:23,883
Around here we mainly catch
bonito and mackerel.

1037
01:29:24,092 --> 01:29:27,357
But that's not enough
to fill local demand,

1038
01:29:27,562 --> 01:29:30,622
so we have other kinds
trucked in from Tokyo.

1039
01:29:35,837 --> 01:29:39,830
Thanks. By the way, where does
the Enoshima trolley run?

1040
01:29:46,280 --> 01:29:47,941
Under that bluff.

1041
01:29:48,149 --> 01:29:50,310
Does the view from there...

1042
01:29:51,953 --> 01:29:54,217
look anything like this?

1043
01:29:54,622 --> 01:29:56,214
Let's see.

1044
01:29:58,292 --> 01:30:01,955
You should be able to see
Enoshima Island from there.

1045
01:30:03,765 --> 01:30:09,499
But if you go further right,
to the hill near the station...

1046
01:30:12,874 --> 01:30:17,368
that cape is in front of Enoshima,
with a view just like this.

1047
01:30:24,719 --> 01:30:27,347
You saw Enoshima Island, right?

1048
01:30:28,723 --> 01:30:30,350
You must have.

1049
01:30:30,558 --> 01:30:32,526
But we didn't come this way.

1050
01:30:47,975 --> 01:30:52,742
Bos'n, I feel
we're getting closer.

1051
01:30:53,948 --> 01:30:57,884
Let's go up that hill.
Try not to look like a cop.

1052
01:30:58,085 --> 01:30:59,882
I'm not the problem.

1053
01:31:00,087 --> 01:31:03,682
You, on the other hand,
would need plastic surgery.

1054
01:31:07,295 --> 01:31:10,355
Daddy!
I saw this tunnel!

1055
01:31:10,565 --> 01:31:13,398
What?
You passed by here?

1056
01:31:14,669 --> 01:31:16,603
From which direction?

1057
01:31:16,804 --> 01:31:18,066
That way.

1058
01:32:08,256 --> 01:32:10,850
Shinichi, is this the spot?

1059
01:32:22,803 --> 01:32:24,634
Hey, look at that.

1060
01:32:24,839 --> 01:32:28,366
Enoshima doesn't look
like an island from here.

1061
01:32:28,576 --> 01:32:29,941
Let's head back.

1062
01:32:30,144 --> 01:32:33,978
They must have Aoki by now.

1063
01:32:34,181 --> 01:32:37,116
We'll wait at the fish market.
If the boy shows us the way,

1064
01:32:37,318 --> 01:32:39,309
with any luck we'll raid
the hideout tonight.

1065
01:32:39,520 --> 01:32:41,351
You got your pistol?

1066
01:32:41,556 --> 01:32:45,583
Of course. I'm not going
after a madman with my bare hands.

1067
01:32:50,831 --> 01:32:53,231
Let's look around on foot.

1068
01:33:02,777 --> 01:33:04,176
That car!

1069
01:33:04,378 --> 01:33:06,278
That's Gondo's car.

1070
01:33:22,663 --> 01:33:26,121
Don't be stupid.
Stop playing detective.

1071
01:33:35,276 --> 01:33:40,646
When I pulled the car up
this morning, Mr. Gondo said,

1072
01:33:40,848 --> 01:33:43,339
"Aoki, all we have now is time.

1073
01:33:43,551 --> 01:33:46,520
We're not going
to the factory anymore."

1074
01:33:48,422 --> 01:33:50,788
He was smiling,

1075
01:33:50,992 --> 01:33:54,758
but I know how he felt inside.

1076
01:33:56,163 --> 01:33:58,290
The directors are horrible men,

1077
01:33:58,499 --> 01:34:01,991
but in the end
it's all my fault.

1078
01:34:02,770 --> 01:34:04,203
That's why...

1079
01:34:06,507 --> 01:34:11,911
But walking around here
with the boy is madness.

1080
01:34:13,447 --> 01:34:17,281
What if the kidnapper saw him?
Imagine the consequences.

1081
01:34:19,720 --> 01:34:21,779
Bos'n, he's gone!

1082
01:34:29,163 --> 01:34:31,188
Daddy!

1083
01:34:32,199 --> 01:34:33,826
Here it is!

1084
01:34:51,385 --> 01:34:54,081
Uncle and Auntie
are sleeping.

1085
01:35:30,191 --> 01:35:32,284
Take the boy away.

1086
01:35:32,493 --> 01:35:34,120
They're dead.

1087
01:36:03,224 --> 01:36:05,021
Thanks for coming,
everybody.

1088
01:36:09,230 --> 01:36:11,425
- Why the press conference?
- Yeah, what'd you find?

1089
01:36:11,632 --> 01:36:13,691
Inspector Tokura
will fill you in.

1090
01:36:13,901 --> 01:36:18,235
However, we ask you
not to print what you hear today.

1091
01:36:20,074 --> 01:36:22,770
Earlier today,

1092
01:36:22,977 --> 01:36:26,140
two accomplices, one male,
one female, were found dead.

1093
01:36:28,582 --> 01:36:31,483
Both from heroin overdose.

1094
01:36:31,685 --> 01:36:34,415
- An accidental overdose?
- I'll explain.

1095
01:36:37,958 --> 01:36:42,520
Their arms were covered
with needle marks.

1096
01:36:42,963 --> 01:36:45,864
Both were long-term addicts.

1097
01:36:46,534 --> 01:36:50,595
It's unlikely
that experienced addicts

1098
01:36:50,805 --> 01:36:53,365
would misjudge the dosage.

1099
01:36:53,574 --> 01:36:57,340
Dealers, furthermore,
don't sell heroin that pure.

1100
01:36:58,712 --> 01:37:02,648
Both died in bed,
their heads resting on pillows.

1101
01:37:03,450 --> 01:37:05,350
<i>Next to the pillows</i>

1102
01:37:05,553 --> 01:37:08,920
we found two empty packets,
two syringes,

1103
01:37:09,123 --> 01:37:13,992
and a cup of water,
maybe to dissolve the heroin.

1104
01:37:15,162 --> 01:37:16,493
In addition,

1105
01:37:16,697 --> 01:37:20,758
we found two unopened
packets of heroin.

1106
01:37:21,869 --> 01:37:25,032
So they obtained four packets,

1107
01:37:25,239 --> 01:37:29,369
They took two right away
and saved two for later.

1108
01:37:29,577 --> 01:37:32,375
These facts
don't suggest suicide.

1109
01:37:34,748 --> 01:37:36,978
So then why did they die?

1110
01:37:40,621 --> 01:37:45,581
The heroin
was unusually pure.

1111
01:37:47,628 --> 01:37:52,998
We analyzed the unused samples.
They were over 90% pure.

1112
01:37:53,234 --> 01:37:55,429
When heroin is smuggled in,

1113
01:37:55,636 --> 01:37:59,595
its purity ranges
from 70% to 95%.

1114
01:38:00,174 --> 01:38:02,938
Dealers cut it

1115
01:38:03,143 --> 01:38:07,512
with glucose
and hydrochloric procaine,

1116
01:38:07,715 --> 01:38:10,411
down to a purity
as low as 30%.

1117
01:38:10,618 --> 01:38:14,179
So a one-gram package

1118
01:38:14,388 --> 01:38:17,880
contains only 0.3 grams
of pure heroin.

1119
01:38:19,193 --> 01:38:22,924
What happens to an addict

1120
01:38:23,130 --> 01:38:27,066
who takes heroin
three times more pure?

1121
01:38:27,668 --> 01:38:30,501
An ingenious murder.

1122
01:38:33,173 --> 01:38:35,971
There's corroborating evidence.

1123
01:38:36,176 --> 01:38:40,237
We found a notepad
in their room.

1124
01:38:40,447 --> 01:38:42,506
The top page
bore impressions

1125
01:38:42,716 --> 01:38:46,880
from scribblings
made on the page above it.

1126
01:38:56,130 --> 01:38:57,961
Please observe.

1127
01:38:58,165 --> 01:39:02,226
It's been reconstructed
and enlarged in this slide.

1128
01:39:02,436 --> 01:39:07,305
The agony of withdrawal
can be clearly seen.

1129
01:39:07,508 --> 01:39:11,638
"Get us more dope.
Bring it fast.

1130
01:39:11,845 --> 01:39:15,008
If you don't,
we'll spend the money.

1131
01:39:15,215 --> 01:39:19,413
We won't do
what you say anymore."

1132
01:39:23,857 --> 01:39:28,658
Clearly, they tried
to blackmail him.

1133
01:39:28,862 --> 01:39:31,695
- That's why he killed them?
- We're not 100% certain,

1134
01:39:31,899 --> 01:39:34,732
but it certainly looks that way.

1135
01:39:34,935 --> 01:39:36,926
Was there money around?

1136
01:39:37,137 --> 01:39:40,402
We found 2,500
of Mr. Gondo's 1,000-yen notes.

1137
01:39:40,607 --> 01:39:43,201
The serial numbers matched.

1138
01:39:43,444 --> 01:39:46,106
The kidnapper may have
figured that out too.

1139
01:39:46,313 --> 01:39:50,977
He gave them a share
but made them wait to spend it.

1140
01:39:51,185 --> 01:39:54,120
We can gather that
from the letter.

1141
01:39:55,055 --> 01:39:57,421
Have you identified
the accomplices?

1142
01:39:57,624 --> 01:40:00,024
Caretakers of the villa.

1143
01:40:00,227 --> 01:40:05,597
We learned that
from the villa's owner.

1144
01:40:06,834 --> 01:40:08,461
So you're close?

1145
01:40:08,669 --> 01:40:12,298
No, we're back to square one.

1146
01:40:12,506 --> 01:40:16,169
Of course,
Narcotics is doing its best.

1147
01:40:16,377 --> 01:40:20,473
They may provide us
with valuable information,

1148
01:40:20,981 --> 01:40:24,473
but the accomplices' deaths

1149
01:40:24,685 --> 01:40:27,415
are a terrible blow
to the investigation.

1150
01:40:28,255 --> 01:40:33,124
The thread leading back
to the kidnapper has been cut.

1151
01:40:37,031 --> 01:40:40,694
That's why I'm asking you:

1152
01:40:41,135 --> 01:40:44,832
Don't print a word of this.

1153
01:40:46,840 --> 01:40:48,467
Why not?

1154
01:40:49,877 --> 01:40:53,335
The kidnapper has yet
to confirm that they're dead.

1155
01:40:55,015 --> 01:40:59,577
We know this because
if he had returned to the villa,

1156
01:40:59,787 --> 01:41:04,622
he wouldn't have left 2.5 million yen
in evidence lying around.

1157
01:41:05,726 --> 01:41:09,093
As far as he knows,

1158
01:41:09,296 --> 01:41:11,890
they may still be alive.

1159
01:41:12,099 --> 01:41:14,397
If we nurse that doubt within him,
how will he react?

1160
01:41:14,768 --> 01:41:19,228
If he is the killer, he'll probably
try to kill them again.

1161
01:41:20,007 --> 01:41:24,501
If there's no report
of their deaths in the papers,

1162
01:41:24,711 --> 01:41:26,542
he won't be able to stay put.

1163
01:41:26,747 --> 01:41:29,215
He'll surely return
to the scene to check.

1164
01:41:29,416 --> 01:41:32,852
- And you'll nab him then?
- That's right.

1165
01:41:33,053 --> 01:41:35,817
Even if we keep quiet,

1166
01:41:36,023 --> 01:41:38,116
won't their deaths
be impossible to hide?

1167
01:41:38,325 --> 01:41:40,350
The neighbors will talk.

1168
01:41:40,561 --> 01:41:42,324
That's not a problem.

1169
01:41:42,529 --> 01:41:47,159
It's a new development
with few houses.

1170
01:41:47,367 --> 01:41:51,667
It's also the off-season,
so hardly anybody's there.

1171
01:41:51,872 --> 01:41:55,330
Drug addicts are cautious.

1172
01:41:55,542 --> 01:41:58,705
They kept to themselves
and had no visitors.

1173
01:41:58,912 --> 01:42:04,407
But will our keeping quiet
really convince the kidnapper?

1174
01:42:06,520 --> 01:42:08,044
Well, that's why

1175
01:42:08,388 --> 01:42:10,618
I have another favor to ask.

1176
01:42:11,825 --> 01:42:15,226
I'd like you
to run a story today

1177
01:42:15,429 --> 01:42:18,023
saying one of the 1,000-yen notes
was spent.

1178
01:42:20,300 --> 01:42:24,236
Of course you can say
it's our announcement.

1179
01:42:24,838 --> 01:42:28,239
I know it's a lot to ask.

1180
01:42:28,442 --> 01:42:31,275
I'm asking your cooperation
for Mr. Gondo's sake too.

1181
01:42:32,713 --> 01:42:36,012
Did you know he was dismissed
from National Shoes

1182
01:42:36,216 --> 01:42:38,810
and kicked out
as factory manager?

1183
01:42:39,520 --> 01:42:41,818
That's terrible.

1184
01:42:42,022 --> 01:42:43,785
They seem to have no sense
of public opinion.

1185
01:42:43,991 --> 01:42:48,394
<i>At the next shareholder meeting,
he'll be voted out completely.</i>

1186
01:42:49,163 --> 01:42:51,131
In place of an article
reporting the deaths,

1187
01:42:51,331 --> 01:42:55,131
shall we slam
National Shoes?

1188
01:42:59,606 --> 01:43:02,097
Why not? Let's give 'em
a good thrashing!

1189
01:43:06,580 --> 01:43:09,481
GONDO FORCED OUT
PUBLIC OPINION IGNORED

1190
01:43:09,950 --> 01:43:13,408
WOMEN START BOYCOTT
OF NATIONAL SHOES

1191
01:43:13,820 --> 01:43:19,452
RISING TIDE
OF SYMPATHY AND ANGER

1192
01:43:27,467 --> 01:43:30,231
1,000-YEN NOTE
FROM RANSOM FOUND

1193
01:43:35,609 --> 01:43:40,012
30 MILLION IN RANSOM
IN BRIEFCASES LIKE THIS

1194
01:45:22,549 --> 01:45:25,609
We've recovered 2.5 million
from the accomplices.

1195
01:45:26,186 --> 01:45:29,178
We can hand it over at the station,
if it's not too much trouble.

1196
01:45:29,389 --> 01:45:31,254
We're sorry that it's so little.

1197
01:45:31,458 --> 01:45:34,086
No, it's a great help now.

1198
01:45:34,828 --> 01:45:38,855
We believe the kidnapper
hasn't spent any yet.

1199
01:45:39,066 --> 01:45:41,933
We hope
to recover it all intact.

1200
01:45:42,135 --> 01:45:46,435
The twist is that he's harder
to catch if he doesn't spend it.

1201
01:45:46,640 --> 01:45:49,074
<i>Kingo,
Mr. Kawanishi is here.</i>

1202
01:45:49,276 --> 01:45:52,439
Kawanishi?
What does he want?

1203
01:45:52,646 --> 01:45:54,113
He has some kind of request.

1204
01:45:54,314 --> 01:45:57,147
- We'll be leaving then...
- No, stay. Send him in.

1205
01:45:58,952 --> 01:46:00,817
Please, help yourself.

1206
01:46:01,021 --> 01:46:03,785
Sorry I haven't been in touch.

1207
01:46:04,558 --> 01:46:06,423
Well, look who's here!

1208
01:46:06,626 --> 01:46:09,151
I must thank both of you.

1209
01:46:10,664 --> 01:46:14,828
You've made Mr. Gondo a hero.
That was a great help.

1210
01:46:15,369 --> 01:46:17,360
What the hell
are you talking about?

1211
01:46:17,804 --> 01:46:20,705
Don't be so cold.

1212
01:46:20,907 --> 01:46:24,035
I was your right-hand man
for over ten years.

1213
01:46:24,244 --> 01:46:27,771
Did you think I would stand by
while they booted you out?

1214
01:46:27,981 --> 01:46:33,214
I risked my own position
to try to keep you on.

1215
01:46:34,621 --> 01:46:38,216
But the Old Man's stubborn,

1216
01:46:38,425 --> 01:46:41,394
and the executive director's
a viper.

1217
01:46:41,595 --> 01:46:43,529
It was a hard-fought battle.

1218
01:46:43,730 --> 01:46:46,255
Fortunately,
public opinion's on your side,

1219
01:46:46,466 --> 01:46:50,027
so I convinced them
to keep you on.

1220
01:46:50,404 --> 01:46:53,896
Get out!
Tell this to your new masters:

1221
01:46:54,107 --> 01:46:57,736
You can't trot me out
to ease the public's anger.

1222
01:46:57,944 --> 01:47:00,777
I refuse to be an ornament,
an executive without power.

1223
01:47:00,981 --> 01:47:03,279
I won't be your puppet.

1224
01:47:06,253 --> 01:47:08,551
Can you afford
to bluff like that?

1225
01:47:08,755 --> 01:47:10,848
You're going too far.

1226
01:47:11,658 --> 01:47:16,152
Right now you have
nothing but debts.

1227
01:47:16,363 --> 01:47:19,821
It may be a position in name only,
but your credit will be intact.

1228
01:47:20,033 --> 01:47:21,762
Get out!

1229
01:47:21,968 --> 01:47:24,801
I'm still the man I've always been,
even more so.

1230
01:47:25,005 --> 01:47:27,997
But you're nothing,
not even a human being.

1231
01:47:55,101 --> 01:47:56,728
Excuse me.

1232
01:47:57,938 --> 01:47:59,872
I'd like you to see something.

1233
01:48:00,340 --> 01:48:01,967
What is it?

1234
01:48:02,375 --> 01:48:04,605
It's nothing much,

1235
01:48:05,679 --> 01:48:08,477
but the last picture
seemed to be of some help.

1236
01:48:09,649 --> 01:48:13,278
Shinichi drew it.
He says it's the kidnapper.

1237
01:48:14,154 --> 01:48:18,215
Dark glasses and a mask.
Not much to go on.

1238
01:48:19,226 --> 01:48:20,693
What's this?

1239
01:48:20,894 --> 01:48:25,194
A handkerchief.
He always wore it.

1240
01:48:27,267 --> 01:48:28,632
Mom!

1241
01:48:28,835 --> 01:48:33,238
Look at the pretty pink smoke
from that chimney.

1242
01:48:44,751 --> 01:48:47,982
You lit the incinerator
around 9:00 a.m., right?

1243
01:48:49,923 --> 01:48:53,324
Yes, every day I burn
the trash from the day before.

1244
01:48:53,527 --> 01:48:55,654
What do you burn?

1245
01:48:58,865 --> 01:49:03,632
Dirty stuff,
junk that you can't disinfect.

1246
01:49:04,104 --> 01:49:07,369
They're always bringing stuff
that won't burn, damn it!

1247
01:49:07,574 --> 01:49:11,066
- Who is?
- Handymen and janitors.

1248
01:49:11,411 --> 01:49:13,709
Anyone else?

1249
01:49:15,515 --> 01:49:19,645
Sometimes hospital nurses
and attendants.

1250
01:49:19,853 --> 01:49:22,219
Anyone like that
come by today?

1251
01:49:22,589 --> 01:49:24,614
Come to think of it,

1252
01:49:24,824 --> 01:49:29,022
a man brought a cardboard box.

1253
01:49:30,397 --> 01:49:33,127
- How big?
- Like this.

1254
01:49:33,333 --> 01:49:35,494
- Anyone you know?
- No.

1255
01:49:35,702 --> 01:49:37,829
An intern maybe.

1256
01:49:38,038 --> 01:49:40,029
A young medical intern?

1257
01:49:40,240 --> 01:49:42,572
Sure looked that way.

1258
01:49:42,776 --> 01:49:45,609
Too young
to be a regular doctor.

1259
01:49:45,812 --> 01:49:49,179
"Burn this, pops," he said.

1260
01:49:49,382 --> 01:49:53,341
Doctors don't call people "pops."
- Anyone else?

1261
01:49:53,553 --> 01:49:56,647
Who'd wanna come
to a place like this?

1262
01:49:56,856 --> 01:49:59,791
Now why'd they bring...

1263
01:50:00,527 --> 01:50:02,893
You can't burn tin!

1264
01:50:08,234 --> 01:50:11,897
Do you know what department
that intern is in?

1265
01:50:12,105 --> 01:50:14,130
How would I know?

1266
01:50:14,341 --> 01:50:16,969
But he was headed
toward Internal Medicine.

1267
01:50:17,177 --> 01:50:19,441
Thanks a lot.

1268
01:51:16,169 --> 01:51:18,103
According to Bos'n's report,

1269
01:51:18,304 --> 01:51:21,671
his name
is Ginjiro Takeuchi.

1270
01:51:21,875 --> 01:51:23,672
An intern.

1271
01:51:23,877 --> 01:51:27,608
He took three days off
during the kidnapping.

1272
01:51:30,617 --> 01:51:32,744
He lives in a studio apartment

1273
01:51:33,286 --> 01:51:37,222
at 4-278 Sengen-cho
in Nishi Ward.

1274
01:51:38,024 --> 01:51:40,219
Sunrise Apartments, No. 12.

1275
01:51:40,627 --> 01:51:45,189
His room faces north,
right at the Gondo residence.

1276
01:51:46,900 --> 01:51:50,893
One of the two phones
that we suspect the kidnapper used

1277
01:51:51,104 --> 01:51:54,232
<i>is right next to his apartment.</i>

1278
01:51:56,476 --> 01:51:58,740
The male and female
accomplices

1279
01:51:58,945 --> 01:52:01,470
had been examined
at his hospital.

1280
01:52:01,681 --> 01:52:04,081
Takeuchi wrote up their charts.

1281
01:52:04,684 --> 01:52:08,279
Both had pulmonary edema,
a result of their drug addiction.

1282
01:52:09,656 --> 01:52:12,147
So we have two addicts
suffering from pulmonary edema,

1283
01:52:12,358 --> 01:52:14,724
as well as from withdrawal.

1284
01:52:14,928 --> 01:52:18,762
An injection of pure heroin
would cause death from shock.

1285
01:52:19,466 --> 01:52:24,233
As their intern,
he would have known that.

1286
01:52:25,205 --> 01:52:29,335
We may conclude
that he is the kidnapper.

1287
01:52:30,877 --> 01:52:33,175
But we can't arrest him.

1288
01:52:34,881 --> 01:52:36,314
Here's why:

1289
01:52:37,283 --> 01:52:42,084
If we arrest him now,
he'll only get 15 years.

1290
01:52:43,323 --> 01:52:45,257
Mr. Gondo,
on the other hand...

1291
01:52:46,793 --> 01:52:50,991
is serving a life sentence of debt
for paying the ransom.

1292
01:52:51,464 --> 01:52:53,830
We won't let that happen.

1293
01:52:54,033 --> 01:52:56,866
A criminal like this
deserves capital punishment.

1294
01:52:57,637 --> 01:53:02,233
What's more, it's clear
he killed his accomplices.

1295
01:53:02,442 --> 01:53:06,378
But if we arrest him now,

1296
01:53:06,579 --> 01:53:10,071
we'll have no material evidence
to prove it.

1297
01:53:11,751 --> 01:53:16,848
There's only one way to bring
this vicious criminal to justice:

1298
01:53:18,291 --> 01:53:21,749
Leave him at large
to reenact his crime.

1299
01:53:22,962 --> 01:53:24,452
But how?

1300
01:53:28,401 --> 01:53:30,369
By giving him this.

1301
01:53:30,570 --> 01:53:32,629
Please lower the blinds.

1302
01:53:43,216 --> 01:53:47,414
GIVE US MORE DOPE.
WE'LL TALK IF YOU DON'T.

1303
01:53:47,620 --> 01:53:50,350
A perfect forgery.

1304
01:54:03,269 --> 01:54:05,066
You Mr. Takeuchi?

1305
01:54:46,279 --> 01:54:49,009
He'll make his move today.

1306
01:54:49,983 --> 01:54:53,851
First, he'll go buy
the heroin.

1307
01:54:54,687 --> 01:54:59,420
Then he'll try to kill them
tonight.

1308
01:55:00,193 --> 01:55:03,128
There's no way
to predict anything else:

1309
01:55:05,064 --> 01:55:08,966
Where he'll go,
how he'll get the drugs.

1310
01:55:09,235 --> 01:55:14,138
We can only know that
by keeping him in our sights.

1311
01:55:15,942 --> 01:55:17,409
Listen carefully:

1312
01:55:17,610 --> 01:55:20,807
Don't let him notice you,
but don't lose him.

1313
01:55:21,614 --> 01:55:24,742
Bos'n, Nakao, Arai and I

1314
01:55:24,951 --> 01:55:29,888
will head to the hideout as soon as
we hear he's obtained the drugs.

1315
01:55:30,089 --> 01:55:33,650
I'll give orders
from the car radio.

1316
01:56:02,388 --> 01:56:04,583
Is he waiting for a dealer?

1317
01:56:04,791 --> 01:56:08,557
<i>Just killing time, I'd say.</i>

1318
01:57:18,498 --> 01:57:21,433
<i>He's walked up and down
this street for two hours.</i>

1319
01:57:21,634 --> 01:57:26,037
<i>If the same people keep tailing him,
he may catch on.</i>

1320
01:58:15,088 --> 01:58:16,453
Inspector!

1321
01:58:16,656 --> 01:58:18,283
Yes. Tokura here.

1322
01:58:18,491 --> 01:58:20,118
<i>He went into a florist's.</i>

1323
01:58:20,326 --> 01:58:24,092
A florist's?
Have someone buy some flowers.

1324
01:58:27,066 --> 01:58:31,628
I'm afraid none of us
fits the part. Wait...

1325
01:58:39,212 --> 01:58:41,544
What?
One carnation?

1326
01:58:41,747 --> 01:58:43,738
<i>Yes. One red carnation.</i>

1327
01:58:43,950 --> 01:58:46,384
Is today Mother's Day?

1328
01:58:59,899 --> 01:59:03,801
Earlier, the suspect spoke
on a pay phone.

1329
01:59:04,237 --> 01:59:08,173
He was told
how to find the dealer.

1330
01:59:08,374 --> 01:59:11,036
The red carnation
must be a sign.

1331
01:59:21,587 --> 01:59:24,920
<i>Watch for anybody
approaching the suspect.</i>

1332
01:59:26,025 --> 01:59:30,428
Watch how the money
and dope change hands.

1333
02:04:52,818 --> 02:04:54,547
<i>Inspector Tokura!</i>

1334
02:04:55,621 --> 02:04:56,588
Tokura speaking.

1335
02:04:56,789 --> 02:04:58,814
<i>- He changed his course.
- What?</i>

1336
02:04:59,024 --> 02:05:01,288
<i>He got out at "Dope Alley."</i>

1337
02:05:01,494 --> 02:05:03,621
So he didn't actually
buy any in the club?

1338
02:05:03,829 --> 02:05:05,990
<i>We're sure he did, but...</i>

1339
02:05:07,132 --> 02:05:09,930
Okay, we're turning back.
Don't lose him!

1340
02:06:10,796 --> 02:06:13,765
What are you staring at?
This ain't a picture show.

1341
02:06:13,966 --> 02:06:15,263
Get the hell out!

1342
02:06:15,467 --> 02:06:17,435
This ain't no place
for the likes of you.

1343
02:06:26,712 --> 02:06:31,081
Lotta strangers snoopin' around
tonight. Be careful.

1344
02:06:31,283 --> 02:06:33,945
What are you, a cop?

1345
02:06:34,153 --> 02:06:36,144
We don't know any of you.

1346
02:06:36,355 --> 02:06:40,086
Get out.
Get out, I said!

1347
02:09:22,488 --> 02:09:26,049
Bos'n, I don't understand
what he's up to.

1348
02:09:26,658 --> 02:09:29,525
He should be taking the dope
straight to the hideout.

1349
02:09:31,463 --> 02:09:36,526
And why go to the junkies
if he hasn't got it yet?

1350
02:09:36,735 --> 02:09:39,203
They don't have
any pure heroin.

1351
02:09:39,404 --> 02:09:42,168
<i>- Inspector!
- Tokura here.</i>

1352
02:09:42,374 --> 02:09:45,537
<i>He picked up a Junkie
and took her to a flophouse.</i>

1353
02:10:02,327 --> 02:10:06,764
KOGANE-CHO INN

1354
02:10:09,668 --> 02:10:11,226
I've got it!

1355
02:10:12,070 --> 02:10:14,903
He'll use her as a guinea pig.

1356
02:10:15,107 --> 02:10:19,134
She's in withdrawal,
and he can test it on her.

1357
02:10:53,645 --> 02:10:57,638
<i>- He left the area.
- And the girl?</i>

1358
02:10:57,850 --> 02:11:00,842
<i>Just a minute.
Two men went to check.</i>

1359
02:11:01,854 --> 02:11:03,845
Where to now?
The hideout?

1360
02:11:04,656 --> 02:11:08,114
<i>Wait a minute. The girl's a clue
to what he'll do next.</i>

1361
02:11:08,327 --> 02:11:10,625
<i>He's headed
toward the Isezaki district.</i>

1362
02:11:10,829 --> 02:11:13,662
What? We're there right now.
From which side?

1363
02:11:13,866 --> 02:11:16,266
<i>Facing Yoshida Bridge,
the left side.</i>

1364
02:11:18,036 --> 02:11:20,300
- Stop here.
- It's a no-parking zone.

1365
02:11:20,505 --> 02:11:21,802
It doesn't matter.

1366
02:11:22,007 --> 02:11:25,135
<i>I've Just received word:
The girl's dead.</i>

1367
02:11:25,344 --> 02:11:27,835
<i>Syringe in her hand.
Death by overdose.</i>

1368
02:11:28,046 --> 02:11:29,206
He's coming.

1369
02:11:31,950 --> 02:11:34,714
We found him.
I'm cutting off the radio.

1370
02:12:58,537 --> 02:13:02,530
The guy's a real prize.
To the hideout.

1371
02:13:02,741 --> 02:13:04,834
Excuse me,
you can't stop here.

1372
02:13:39,277 --> 02:13:41,541
<i>It's 12:15 a.m.</i>

1373
02:15:02,094 --> 02:15:04,858
Hey, I brought the stuff.

1374
02:15:07,432 --> 02:15:10,959
Takeuchi, you're gonna hang!

1375
02:15:37,562 --> 02:15:40,360
We've recovered
another 27,480,000 yen.

1376
02:15:40,565 --> 02:15:43,796
All that's missing
is the 20,000 he spent on heroin.

1377
02:15:44,002 --> 02:15:46,368
We wanted to let you know
as soon as possible.

1378
02:15:46,571 --> 02:15:48,539
Thank you.

1379
02:16:06,057 --> 02:16:07,957
Were we too late?

1380
02:16:08,160 --> 02:16:09,957
Have a seat.

1381
02:16:10,262 --> 02:16:11,524
Please.

1382
02:16:26,178 --> 02:16:30,342
No, please. You're free
to use them until the auction.

1383
02:16:53,038 --> 02:16:56,201
SEIZED PROPERTY

1384
02:17:15,193 --> 02:17:18,526
GINJIRO TAKEUCHI
GETS DEATH SENTENCE

1385
02:17:26,571 --> 02:17:28,334
Thank you for coming.

1386
02:17:28,873 --> 02:17:33,071
He refused to talk
with the prison chaplain.

1387
02:17:33,478 --> 02:17:36,606
He insisted on speaking
to you instead.

1388
02:18:28,800 --> 02:18:31,598
Mr. Gondo,
thanks for coming.

1389
02:18:56,895 --> 02:18:58,886
You seem well.

1390
02:19:02,901 --> 02:19:05,267
What are you doing now?

1391
02:19:06,204 --> 02:19:08,798
Making shoes again.

1392
02:19:10,375 --> 02:19:14,402
It's a small company,
but the owner gives me free rein.

1393
02:19:15,180 --> 02:19:20,618
I'm working hard
to rival National Shoes.

1394
02:19:27,592 --> 02:19:29,753
Why are you looking
at me like that?

1395
02:19:30,862 --> 02:19:34,354
I'm going to die,
but I'm not afraid,

1396
02:19:34,566 --> 02:19:37,763
so stop looking at me
so pitifully.

1397
02:19:40,105 --> 02:19:43,131
That's why I refused
to see the chaplain.

1398
02:19:43,341 --> 02:19:46,071
He'd tell me to repent
and pray for mercy.

1399
02:19:46,277 --> 02:19:48,745
Why should I waste my time?

1400
02:19:51,149 --> 02:19:55,347
I'd rather be told the cruel truth

1401
02:19:55,553 --> 02:19:58,579
than be fed gentle lies.

1402
02:20:08,933 --> 02:20:13,336
Speaking of which,
you must be glad I'm going to die.

1403
02:20:13,538 --> 02:20:15,403
Aren't you?

1404
02:20:16,775 --> 02:20:18,868
Why do you say such things?

1405
02:20:19,077 --> 02:20:23,741
Why do you think
we have to hate each other?

1406
02:20:23,948 --> 02:20:26,041
I don't know.

1407
02:20:27,452 --> 02:20:30,148
I'm not interested
in self-analysis.

1408
02:20:32,090 --> 02:20:37,084
But I do know my room
was so cold in winter

1409
02:20:37,295 --> 02:20:39,593
and so hot in summer
I couldn't sleep.

1410
02:20:39,798 --> 02:20:43,734
From my tiny room,
your house looked like heaven.

1411
02:20:44,335 --> 02:20:47,827
Day by day I came
to hate you more.

1412
02:20:48,039 --> 02:20:50,803
It gave me a reason for living.

1413
02:20:57,482 --> 02:21:01,145
Besides, it's amusing
to make fortunate men

1414
02:21:01,352 --> 02:21:04,480
taste the same misery
as the unfortunate.

1415
02:21:06,391 --> 02:21:08,916
Were you really
so unfortunate?

1416
02:21:18,336 --> 02:21:21,066
You want my life story?
Forget it.

1417
02:21:21,272 --> 02:21:26,107
I won't share my tales of woe
to earn your sympathy.

1418
02:21:27,345 --> 02:21:30,007
I'm just glad my mom
died last year,

1419
02:21:30,215 --> 02:21:34,948
so I won't be sickened
by her pathetic slobbering.

1420
02:21:38,756 --> 02:21:42,715
Then why exactly
did you call me here?

1421
02:21:47,131 --> 02:21:52,797
I couldn't stand having you think
I died crying and afraid.

1422
02:22:08,820 --> 02:22:12,620
You think I'm shaking out of fear,
but I'm not!

1423
02:22:12,824 --> 02:22:17,386
It's just a physiological reaction
from being in solitary too long.

1424
02:22:17,795 --> 02:22:21,231
Just leaving the cell
makes me shake.

1425
02:22:24,602 --> 02:22:28,470
I'm not afraid of death.
I don't care if I go to hell.

1426
02:22:28,673 --> 02:22:31,904
My life has been hell
since the day I was born.

1427
02:22:34,846 --> 02:22:40,182
But if I had to go to heaven,
then I'd really start to tremble.

1428
02:23:25,096 --> 02:23:28,463
THE END
