1
00:00:00,029 --> 00:00:05,592
''Slake the thirst that
lies deep in my soul''

2
00:00:06,635 --> 00:00:12,540
''Beloved, make my love complete...''

3
00:00:21,917 --> 00:00:28,720
''so it may last
beyond eternity"

4
00:02:52,601 --> 00:02:56,401
There is a millionaire
in the car. Come with me.

5
00:02:57,773 --> 00:02:59,900
No! go away!

6
00:03:01,777 --> 00:03:05,076
You won't?
l've already promised him!

7
00:03:06,448 --> 00:03:08,416
Let me go!

8
00:03:11,220 --> 00:03:13,188
You won't obey me?

9
00:03:27,236 --> 00:03:29,204
Get going!

10
00:03:29,905 --> 00:03:34,706
And thank your lucky stars
l used my weak hand.

11
00:03:35,244 --> 00:03:37,212
Be seated.

12
00:03:37,746 --> 00:03:42,547
This is my territory and
if anyone disturbs you...

13
00:03:42,685 --> 00:03:45,381
...just call for me,
l'll come running.

14
00:03:47,589 --> 00:03:49,557
Where are you?

15
00:03:50,592 --> 00:03:54,050
What did you say?
- l didn't say a word.

16
00:03:55,431 --> 00:03:58,400
She's lost, isn't she?

17
00:03:59,768 --> 00:04:01,895
Who is he?
- Who?

18
00:04:02,104 --> 00:04:04,231
l wouldn't ask if l knew,
would l?

19
00:04:04,606 --> 00:04:08,906
Just a postman knows the
meaning of postcard, so l...

20
00:04:09,044 --> 00:04:11,410
a masseur, can tell things
at a glance...

21
00:04:11,780 --> 00:04:16,240
Sitting here looking lost,
not noticing me.

22
00:04:16,385 --> 00:04:19,582
Not hearing a word,
that's a sure sign.

23
00:04:19,722 --> 00:04:22,088
l see you've fallen in love.

24
00:04:23,459 --> 00:04:25,586
Rushing off is a sign, too.

25
00:04:28,130 --> 00:04:30,098
Tell me truly who he is.

26
00:04:31,467 --> 00:04:34,436
A poet.
- l have a poet friend.

27
00:04:34,636 --> 00:04:36,604
What's your poet's name?

28
00:04:37,639 --> 00:04:40,767
Vijay.
- So is mine.

29
00:04:40,976 --> 00:04:43,444
l'll ask him if he
knows another Vijay-poet.

30
00:04:43,812 --> 00:04:45,939
Maybe they're the same person.

31
00:04:49,318 --> 00:04:54,278
Possibly, l'll ask him
Brothers, is all well?

32
00:05:22,951 --> 00:05:24,248
What are you doing?

33
00:05:24,386 --> 00:05:29,085
What's it you if someone
is dead, you vagabond?

34
00:05:29,291 --> 00:05:31,259
Who is dead?

35
00:05:32,961 --> 00:05:35,088
Whose last rites are these?
- Mother's.

36
00:05:42,971 --> 00:05:44,598
Don't call us brother.

37
00:05:44,807 --> 00:05:46,775
We share our relationship
because of her.

38
00:05:47,142 --> 00:05:49,770
And now that she is dead,
you are dead for us.

39
00:05:55,818 --> 00:05:59,618
''Where will you go
on the empty stomach''

40
00:06:01,323 --> 00:06:03,621
''Who will look after you''

41
00:06:04,660 --> 00:06:09,791
''l don't want to stay in this
house for another minute''

42
00:06:20,609 --> 00:06:25,069
Let's see you dance.
l'll play the drums for you.

43
00:06:25,614 --> 00:06:28,412
Ask your friend to join us.

44
00:06:28,784 --> 00:06:31,082
Come on, drink it!

45
00:06:31,286 --> 00:06:34,414
l'd drink poison for her
is she told me to.

46
00:06:36,625 --> 00:06:38,593
He's shy!

47
00:06:39,294 --> 00:06:43,253
Come, sir,
have a drink for my sake.

48
00:06:44,633 --> 00:06:46,260
Strange chap!

49
00:06:46,635 --> 00:06:49,934
Are you a man or a mouse?
You look as if your grandma died.

50
00:07:08,323 --> 00:07:11,224
He's a beginner,
but he's finished it!

51
00:07:11,927 --> 00:07:17,058
You can't be a real beginner!
When did you start?

52
00:07:18,100 --> 00:07:22,560
''l was so overcome
with sorrow"

53
00:07:24,773 --> 00:07:29,403
''l drank to drown
the grief"

54
00:07:32,114 --> 00:07:37,074
''My poor heart was so dejected''

55
00:07:38,787 --> 00:07:43,247
''l drank out of pity for it''

56
00:07:47,963 --> 00:07:49,931
So he's a poet, too?

57
00:07:50,299 --> 00:07:54,929
lndeed! He's composed
hundreds of poems.

58
00:07:56,305 --> 00:08:00,435
''For so many years
the world...''

59
00:08:01,643 --> 00:08:04,942
''has rejected and dismissed me''

60
00:08:07,149 --> 00:08:12,553
''Today l...''

61
00:08:13,922 --> 00:08:18,052
''... reject the world''

62
00:08:20,429 --> 00:08:25,560
''And l think...''

63
00:08:27,436 --> 00:08:31,896
''... to forget that it exists''

64
00:10:08,136 --> 00:10:10,104
Where to?

65
00:10:12,741 --> 00:10:14,538
My child is ill.

66
00:10:14,743 --> 00:10:18,042
l need you, too.
Tend to us first.

67
00:10:18,914 --> 00:10:22,873
Tend to us first,
then see to your child.

68
00:10:29,257 --> 00:10:31,225
Start the music.

69
00:11:31,419 --> 00:11:36,880
''These lanes, these houses,
where pleasure is auctioned''

70
00:11:45,267 --> 00:11:50,227
''These ravaged caravans of
life that pass us by"

71
00:11:50,772 --> 00:11:55,903
''Where are they,
the guardians of dignity?''

72
00:11:56,444 --> 00:12:01,245
''Where are those who claim
to be proud of this land?''

73
00:12:23,405 --> 00:12:28,536
''These insidious streets,
where infamy is traded''

74
00:12:29,077 --> 00:12:34,208
''Where men conceal their
names, where money talks''

75
00:12:34,583 --> 00:12:39,885
''Where chastity is bargained for
and purity is sold''

76
00:12:40,255 --> 00:12:45,215
''Where are those who claim
to be proud of this land?''

77
00:12:56,771 --> 00:13:01,902
''These old streets
where dreams wither...''

78
00:13:02,611 --> 00:13:07,742
''where flowers are
trampled underfoot''

79
00:13:08,283 --> 00:13:13,346
''These sham celebrations
of colour are for sale''

80
00:13:13,722 --> 00:13:18,523
''Where are those who claim
to be proud of this land?''

81
00:13:30,071 --> 00:13:35,532
''These brightly lit rooms
where dancing bells chime''

82
00:13:38,580 --> 00:13:43,540
''The tables beat in time
with heavy hearts''

83
00:13:57,265 --> 00:14:02,567
''These soulless rooms
that echo to coughing''

84
00:14:03,271 --> 00:14:08,231
''Where are those who claim
to be proud of this land?''

85
00:14:19,955 --> 00:14:24,915
''These garlands, these walls...''

86
00:14:25,627 --> 00:14:30,587
''... stained with blood''

87
00:14:30,966 --> 00:14:36,097
''These fragile bodies,
these vain faces''

88
00:14:36,638 --> 00:14:41,769
''Where are those who claim
to be proud of this land?''

89
00:14:53,488 --> 00:14:58,790
''Old men pass through here,
young man too stop awhile''

90
00:14:59,327 --> 00:15:05,789
''Sons, respected fathers
and husbands''

''These are our wives,
our sisters, our mothers''

''Where are those who claim
to be proud of this land?''

93
00:15:36,965 --> 00:15:41,595
''These daughters
of Eve seek help''

94
00:15:42,137 --> 00:15:47,268
''These daughters
of Radha and Yashoda''

95
00:15:58,987 --> 00:16:04,289
''These daughters of Zulekha,
these children of God''

96

''Where are the leaders who claim
to be proud of this land?''

''Summon all the leaders
of this land''

98

''Show them the treachery,
show them these devious streets''

99

''Summon all those who claim
to be proud of this land''

100
00:17:20,568 --> 00:17:23,366
Who is it? lt's you.

101
00:17:25,740 --> 00:17:27,708
Come with me.

102
00:17:29,410 --> 00:17:31,640
Taking a pity of me again?

103
00:17:33,848 --> 00:17:36,316
Today l am not hungry.

104
00:17:37,018 --> 00:17:41,648
l have drowned
my hunger in drink.

105
00:17:43,358 --> 00:17:45,326
l have drunk

106
00:17:47,529 --> 00:17:53,331
...all my joys and sorrows.
l have swallowed everything.

107
00:17:54,869 --> 00:17:57,838
Where to?

108
00:17:58,540 --> 00:18:02,670
Come and rest in my house.

109
00:18:04,546 --> 00:18:06,514
Leave when you feel better.

110
00:18:07,048 --> 00:18:10,176
Should l leave
when l feel better?

111
00:18:11,052 --> 00:18:15,011
l'll feel better when
l've left this world, Gulabo.

112
00:18:16,891 --> 00:18:18,859
Everything is lost.

113
00:18:19,394 --> 00:18:26,027
My job. And my mother
has left me forever.

114
00:18:28,236 --> 00:18:32,969
What am l doing here?
Why am l alive, Gulabo?

115
00:18:33,441 --> 00:18:35,409
Don't talk like that.

116
00:18:36,010 --> 00:18:39,138
The world needs you
and your poetry.

117
00:18:39,280 --> 00:18:41,305
The world needs nobody.

118
00:18:42,517 --> 00:18:46,977
l tried my best to make
my poetry reach the world.

119
00:18:47,855 --> 00:18:50,983
But you know how
the world valued it?

120
00:18:51,693 --> 00:18:55,652
Waste paper sold for ten annas.

121
00:18:56,698 --> 00:19:00,327
My life is valued at
ten annas, Gulabo.

122
00:19:00,702 --> 00:19:04,502
Do you want me to live
for ten annas?

123
00:19:05,707 --> 00:19:10,007
Don't lose courage,
there's much to live for.

124
00:19:11,212 --> 00:19:13,180
There's Meena.

125
00:19:19,554 --> 00:19:21,522
How do you know her?

126
00:19:22,223 --> 00:19:26,182
l read her name on your file.
Who is she?

127
00:19:30,665 --> 00:19:34,795
She is chaste and
virtuous society girl...

128
00:19:35,670 --> 00:19:39,128
...who loves for fun
and amusement...

129
00:19:39,674 --> 00:19:43,474
...and sells that love
for comfort.

130
00:19:45,680 --> 00:19:49,138
But why take
such an interest in her?

131
00:19:53,354 --> 00:19:55,322
Because you did.

132
00:19:56,691 --> 00:19:58,659
That's why.

133
00:20:06,868 --> 00:20:08,836
You mean you...

134
00:20:09,704 --> 00:20:12,002
No, forget me.

135
00:20:13,875 --> 00:20:17,333
l can only make you suffer.

136
00:20:18,713 --> 00:20:23,013
l've never been able
to make anyone happy.

137
00:21:22,710 --> 00:21:25,508
You'll publish them?
- What for?

138
00:21:25,713 --> 00:21:29,012
Am l mad?
Call that gibberish poetry?

139
00:21:29,384 --> 00:21:31,284
The world needs you...

140
00:21:31,652 --> 00:21:36,282
You must know we publish famous
poets, not the trash of novices.

141
00:21:36,424 --> 00:21:38,392
Could you bear my burden...

142
00:21:38,493 --> 00:21:40,120
...when you couldn't
feed yourself?

143
00:21:40,328 --> 00:21:42,956
lt wasn't our wish that...

144
00:21:43,097 --> 00:21:46,123
...our parents produce
such a good-for-nothing.

145
00:25:28,856 --> 00:25:30,756
Have you read about the poet?

146
00:25:30,891 --> 00:25:33,917
l knew him well.
Why did he commit suicide?

147
00:25:35,863 --> 00:25:37,831
''Tragic death of young poet''

148
00:25:44,639 --> 00:25:48,769

in front of the Burdwan train''

beyond recognition''

his last message to world''

152

''His name was... Vijay"

153
00:26:16,337 --> 00:26:17,964
Are you all right?

154
00:27:04,385 --> 00:27:06,353
What is it?

155
00:27:48,362 --> 00:27:50,330
SHADOWS

156
00:27:56,370 --> 00:27:58,338
Send her in.

157
00:28:14,221 --> 00:28:16,189
Who are you?

158
00:28:21,228 --> 00:28:26,359
Where from?
- Sona...from Dharmtallah.

159
00:28:29,737 --> 00:28:31,466
Give me the poems.

160
00:28:31,672 --> 00:28:35,972
lf you know they are poems,
you'll know they are beautiful.

161
00:28:37,011 --> 00:28:38,979
l want them published.

162
00:28:47,521 --> 00:28:50,649
So you're going to show them
to my husband.

163
00:28:53,194 --> 00:28:55,662
What's your price?
- You'll publish them?

164
00:28:55,863 --> 00:28:59,162
May l will, may be not.
Name your price!

165
00:29:00,534 --> 00:29:01,831
Price?

166
00:29:04,038 --> 00:29:08,839
l haven't come to bargain.
l want them published.

167
00:29:14,215 --> 00:29:17,184
Are these poems precious
to you?

168
00:29:19,720 --> 00:29:21,688
How did you know Vijay?

169
00:29:22,723 --> 00:29:25,191
By good fortune.
- Your relationship?

170
00:29:27,895 --> 00:29:29,192
Relationship?

171
00:29:29,396 --> 00:29:34,299
How could such a gentleman
meet a lady of your background?

172
00:29:35,669 --> 00:29:37,637
Good fortune.

173
00:29:38,172 --> 00:29:40,140
You sell much for money.

174
00:29:40,841 --> 00:29:42,968
Why not sell these poems?

175
00:29:50,851 --> 00:29:52,819
Are you Meena?

176
00:29:54,021 --> 00:29:57,650
My husband will be here
any moment.

177
00:29:58,025 --> 00:29:59,993
Sell me the poems before he comes.

178
00:30:00,361 --> 00:30:04,661
l'll pay 1,000 rupees...2000.
- Not even 30,000.

179
00:30:10,371 --> 00:30:13,340
What's that? Show me.

180
00:30:23,217 --> 00:30:24,684
''For Meena...''

181
00:30:26,820 --> 00:30:29,687
''...whose memory
has inspired every word''

182
00:30:51,345 --> 00:30:53,973
l brought them
to have them published.

183
00:31:08,696 --> 00:31:12,154
What is that?
- lt's all l own in the world.

184
00:31:14,535 --> 00:31:19,495
l can't pay you more
for their publication.

185
00:31:23,544 --> 00:31:25,512
They must be published.

186
00:31:27,214 --> 00:31:31,947
l'll be eternally
grateful to you.

187
00:32:03,017 --> 00:32:07,477
A fine bookseller you are!
We want Vijay's book.

188
00:32:08,689 --> 00:32:11,817
How can it be sold out so soon?

189
00:32:12,359 --> 00:32:14,486
ls it ''under the counter''?

190
00:32:15,029 --> 00:32:18,829
Have the third edition tomorrow.
Or we'll burn the shop.

191
00:32:39,153 --> 00:32:42,122
lf only you were alive
to see this.

192
00:32:54,501 --> 00:32:56,969
Have you established his identity?

193
00:32:57,337 --> 00:33:01,296
No, he hasn't said one word
since he was admitted.

194
00:33:16,356 --> 00:33:18,324
How are you?

195
00:33:22,696 --> 00:33:25,995
Let me know if he speaks at all.

196
00:33:42,649 --> 00:33:45,447
l can't pay more than
5,000 for them.

197
00:33:45,986 --> 00:33:48,955
They've his poems
but too high a price.

198
00:33:49,323 --> 00:33:54,784
Do you want to cream of all the
profit and leave me with nothing?

199
00:33:54,995 --> 00:33:57,964
Then name a sensible price politely.

200
00:33:58,332 --> 00:34:01,790
Sir, these poems are priceless.

201
00:34:02,002 --> 00:34:06,132
Vijay's last, unique works.

202
00:34:07,174 --> 00:34:09,142
l'll share fifty-fifty.

203
00:34:09,676 --> 00:34:13,635
l can't pay that much.
- Nice to have met you.

204
00:34:15,182 --> 00:34:17,650
You're strange.

205
00:34:18,519 --> 00:34:22,819
Twenty five per cent.
My last offer.

206
00:34:23,891 --> 00:34:25,859
Now you may leave.

207
00:34:26,193 --> 00:34:30,425
l wouldn't like you to
think l'm unreasonable.

208
00:34:30,797 --> 00:34:32,765
Here, let's shake on it.

209
00:34:34,801 --> 00:34:36,428
''l recollect the past''

210
00:34:36,803 --> 00:34:43,436
''l adorn your hair with flowers''

211
00:34:44,645 --> 00:34:47,614
''What is this secret
which chokes me...''

212
00:34:48,482 --> 00:34:51,280
''which parches my lips?''

213
00:34:52,319 --> 00:34:55,618
''l recollect the past''

214
00:35:18,512 --> 00:35:19,638
''Shadows''

215
00:35:28,422 --> 00:35:33,257
These are my poems, all mine.
This is my book.

216
00:35:33,460 --> 00:35:36,088
Of course.
But what is your name?

217
00:35:36,630 --> 00:35:41,590
My name is Vijay. This book
was written by me.

218
00:35:42,469 --> 00:35:45,768
The Vijay who wrote
this book is dead.

219
00:35:46,306 --> 00:35:49,104
Think carefully,
what is your real name?

220
00:35:50,143 --> 00:35:52,111
Why don't you believe me?

221
00:35:52,980 --> 00:35:57,110
l tell you my name is Vijay.

222
00:36:11,665 --> 00:36:13,633
Why have you kept me here?

223
00:36:15,335 --> 00:36:16,962
Let me go!

224
00:36:19,673 --> 00:36:23,302
l think he has lost his mind.

225
00:36:25,679 --> 00:36:27,647
Telephone Doctor Sen.

226
00:36:44,030 --> 00:36:45,998
So you are Vijay's brothers?

227
00:36:46,866 --> 00:36:50,324
His elder brothers.
- l'm the eldest.

228
00:36:51,704 --> 00:36:53,501
What do you want?

229
00:36:56,376 --> 00:36:59,834
Shall l tell him?
- No, you go ahead.

230
00:37:01,381 --> 00:37:03,508
l asked you what you want.

231
00:37:04,384 --> 00:37:08,844
Well, l brought up Vijay
and educated him...

232
00:37:09,055 --> 00:37:14,687
...and cared for him so that
he would be someone one day.

233
00:37:15,561 --> 00:37:19,019
So did l.
- l have no time. Get to the point.

234
00:37:20,233 --> 00:37:25,193
The point is, we've come for
some money from you.

235
00:37:30,677 --> 00:37:32,645
Are you sane?

236
00:37:32,845 --> 00:37:36,144
We are the rightful heirs
to his property.

237
00:37:36,349 --> 00:37:37,646
lncluding poems.

238
00:37:37,850 --> 00:37:42,651
We have a legal right to the
money you gain from his works.

239
00:37:42,789 --> 00:37:47,158
We don't want it all,
we'll be content with some.

240
00:37:48,528 --> 00:37:51,827
l don't know you and l didn't
get the poems from you.

241
00:37:52,365 --> 00:37:54,993
You won't get a penny.
Understand?

242
00:38:43,850 --> 00:38:46,478
lt isn't Vijay.

243
00:38:50,690 --> 00:38:52,157
Shyam!

244
00:38:54,527 --> 00:38:57,325
No, he's not Vijay.

245
00:39:20,887 --> 00:39:22,855
So you want a share?

246
00:39:27,560 --> 00:39:30,120
The rightful claimant is Vijay.

247
00:39:31,164 --> 00:39:33,132
He's alive.

248
00:39:34,333 --> 00:39:36,301
Yes, he's alive.

249
00:39:43,342 --> 00:39:45,310
No! You must be joking.

250
00:39:45,511 --> 00:39:47,479
l never joke.

251
00:39:47,680 --> 00:39:51,980
However, you will get
a share of the profit.

252
00:39:52,685 --> 00:39:54,653
Two percent...

253
00:39:55,354 --> 00:39:57,322
...on condition that...

254
00:39:57,690 --> 00:40:00,158
...you refuse to identify Vijay.

255
00:40:02,695 --> 00:40:05,823
Why shouldn't we identify
our brother?

256
00:40:06,032 --> 00:40:08,830
What are we?
- Do you consider us so low?

257
00:40:08,968 --> 00:40:13,667
For a mere two per cent?
- Make it 6°/.

258
00:40:18,711 --> 00:40:22,670
Massage! Oil Massage!

259
00:40:39,999 --> 00:40:44,800
A ghost!
Lord, please make it vanish.

260
00:40:55,348 --> 00:40:57,646
Let go off poor Sattar!

261
00:40:57,850 --> 00:41:00,148
lt's me, Vijay.

262
00:41:02,355 --> 00:41:04,323
So you aren't dead.

263
00:41:06,025 --> 00:41:08,152
He's really alive.

264
00:41:08,694 --> 00:41:12,994
l've been forcibly detained.
Get me out.

265
00:41:21,541 --> 00:41:23,008
What is it?

266
00:41:23,209 --> 00:41:27,669
l'll massage your head
only if you agree.

267
00:41:33,920 --> 00:41:38,118
''lf your head reels with pain,
or your heart sinks in gloom''

268
00:42:15,861 --> 00:42:17,328
Brother.

269
00:42:34,313 --> 00:42:40,274
Don't you recognize me?
l'm your brother Vijay.

270
00:42:42,154 --> 00:42:44,122
Why so quiet?

271
00:42:45,825 --> 00:42:47,952
Won't you recognize me, either?

272
00:42:48,661 --> 00:42:51,459
Are you mad?
Vijay's dead.

273
00:42:52,832 --> 00:42:56,791
You've the nerve
to call yourself our brother.

274
00:42:57,003 --> 00:43:03,306
Get out of here! Our brother!

275
00:43:26,699 --> 00:43:31,261
Going to the meeting for
Vijay's death anniversary?

276
00:43:31,971 --> 00:43:36,601
Of course.
Vijay was a friend of mine.

277
00:43:37,309 --> 00:43:39,436
Did you really know Vijay?

278
00:43:45,317 --> 00:43:48,286
Move aside, let me pass.

279
00:43:50,823 --> 00:43:52,290
He was fine poet.

280
00:43:52,425 --> 00:43:56,953
A noble man.
lf it wasn't for my help...

281
00:43:57,763 --> 00:44:00,288
...he would have died
6 months earlier.

282
00:44:00,499 --> 00:44:03,297
How?
- Of starvation.

283
00:44:05,671 --> 00:44:07,639
Hurry, we won't get a seat.

284
00:44:51,150 --> 00:44:53,778
You all know...

285
00:44:54,653 --> 00:44:57,952
...we are gathered
in memory of Vijay.

286
00:44:59,992 --> 00:45:02,790
On this day last year...

287
00:45:03,329 --> 00:45:07,629
...a terrible event took
the great poem from us.

288
00:45:08,501 --> 00:45:12,130
lf l could have saved Vijay,
l would have given my fortune...

289
00:45:12,671 --> 00:45:15,139
...and my life.

290
00:45:17,176 --> 00:45:19,144
lt could not be.

291
00:45:21,180 --> 00:45:24,149
Why? Because of you all.

292
00:45:25,017 --> 00:45:27,815
lt is said
he committed suicide...

293
00:45:28,187 --> 00:45:30,087
But in fact you killed him.

294
00:45:30,723 --> 00:45:33,419
lf Vijay were alive
he would see...

295
00:45:33,959 --> 00:45:35,927
the world which...

296
00:45:36,295 --> 00:45:39,423
...starved him is ready
to shower wealth on him.

297
00:45:40,633 --> 00:45:42,430
The world in which...

298
00:45:42,802 --> 00:45:46,101
...he died unknown,
would treat him as a king.

299
00:45:46,972 --> 00:45:52,433
Today this world
would give him a palace.

300
00:45:56,982 --> 00:46:03,615
''This world of palaces, of kingdoms,
this world of power''

301
00:46:04,323 --> 00:46:10,785
''The enemies of humanity,
this world of rituals''

302
00:46:29,682 --> 00:46:35,814
''These men who crave wealth,
as their way of life''

303
00:46:36,522 --> 00:46:42,825
''For what will it profit a man
if he gain the world?''

304
00:47:01,313 --> 00:47:07,513
''People with parched souls,
with wounded spirits''

305
00:47:08,220 --> 00:47:14,523
''With troubled gaze and sad hearts''

306
00:47:15,561 --> 00:47:21,363
''This world which is distraught,
and full of trouble''

307
00:47:22,334 --> 00:47:28,364
''For what shall it profit a man
if he gain the world?''

308
00:47:46,525 --> 00:47:52,486
''The world where life
is considered trivial''

309
00:47:53,365 --> 00:47:59,326
''A world where the dead
are worshipped''

310
00:48:00,205 --> 00:48:06,166
''A world where death
is cheaper than life''

311
00:48:07,046 --> 00:48:13,007
''For what shall it profit a man
if he gain the world?''

312
00:48:31,170 --> 00:48:36,972
''A world where youth
is driven to crime''

313
00:48:37,676 --> 00:48:43,979
''A world where the young are
groomed for the market-place''

314
00:48:44,850 --> 00:48:50,811
''A world where love is another name
for trade''

315
00:48:51,857 --> 00:48:57,818
''For what shall it profit a man
if he gain the world?''

316
00:49:15,814 --> 00:49:22,014
''A world where man is worth nothing''

317
00:49:22,554 --> 00:49:28,857
''A world where loyalty and friendship
mean nothing''

318
00:49:43,342 --> 00:49:49,303
''A world where love is
regarded with disdain''

319
00:49:50,115 --> 00:49:56,315
''For what shall it profit a man
if he gain the world?''

320
00:50:16,375 --> 00:50:21,335
''Burn this world, blow it asunder''

321
00:50:22,147 --> 00:50:29,679
''Burn this world, blow it asunder''

322
00:50:30,255 --> 00:50:35,283
''Take this world away
from my sight''

323
00:50:35,761 --> 00:50:40,630
''This world belongs to you,
you keep it''

324
00:50:41,500 --> 00:50:46,301
''For what shall it profit a man
if he gain the world?''

325
00:52:05,184 --> 00:52:08,984
Stop his brothers,
give whatever they want.

326
00:52:09,688 --> 00:52:11,656
They mustn't identify him.

327
00:52:12,357 --> 00:52:14,325
Sorry, all your resources
cannot stop...

328
00:52:15,194 --> 00:52:17,662
...Vijay being identified now.

329
00:52:18,697 --> 00:52:20,665
Can you bribe everyone now?

330
00:52:21,200 --> 00:52:24,499
Buy everyone,
l'll spend all l have...

331
00:52:24,970 --> 00:52:27,495
l don't want it proved
he's Vijay.

332
00:52:28,140 --> 00:52:31,268
Or we'll lose our name,
we'll be finished.

333
00:52:31,643 --> 00:52:35,773
Save yourself. l know how
to save my own neck.

334
00:52:36,315 --> 00:52:43,778
What!
You think you'll do it so easily?

335
00:52:44,323 --> 00:52:47,121
You denied him, too!

336
00:52:48,660 --> 00:52:50,958
l sway with the wind.

337
00:52:51,330 --> 00:52:56,791
l followed you when it was in my
interest. Now l'll ally with Vijay.

338
00:53:13,018 --> 00:53:15,486
You're looking happy.

339
00:53:15,687 --> 00:53:19,646
Why not? l have my hands on
the king of fame.

340
00:53:19,858 --> 00:53:25,160
l've got Vijay; l'll earn
millions by publishing his poems.

341
00:53:27,032 --> 00:53:29,000
Bravo! Excellent!

342
00:53:29,534 --> 00:53:32,765
lt's a goldmine.

343
00:53:33,305 --> 00:53:35,773
Do you think
you'll mine it alone?

344
00:53:37,643 --> 00:53:39,611
You'll share it with me.

345
00:53:40,646 --> 00:53:44,104
What are you gaping at?
Get out!

346
00:53:50,155 --> 00:53:52,783
You are very insolent, young man.

347
00:53:53,492 --> 00:53:56,290
Who are you?
- Never mind.

348
00:53:57,162 --> 00:54:00,791
But l can identify Vijay
if l so choose...

349
00:54:01,166 --> 00:54:05,626
...and if l don't, he'll
be shut away as a lunatic.

350
00:54:06,004 --> 00:54:09,963
Are you the head of state,
to lock someone away?

351
00:54:10,342 --> 00:54:13,470
His brothers know him.

352
00:54:13,679 --> 00:54:16,978
We'll identify him.
- Of course.

353
00:54:17,182 --> 00:54:21,312
He may not care about us.
- We may not profit.

354
00:54:21,520 --> 00:54:24,318
After all he is our blood.
- Why shouldn't we identify him?

355
00:54:24,523 --> 00:54:27,981
Well said!

356
00:54:28,527 --> 00:54:31,587
Brothers are Brothers!

357
00:54:31,797 --> 00:54:34,595
l spent 5,000 on his education.

358
00:54:34,800 --> 00:54:36,267
4,000 on feeding.

359
00:54:36,468 --> 00:54:39,596
lf we'd loaned it,
we'd have 15,000 now.

360
00:54:39,805 --> 00:54:42,273
Will you pay to identify him?

361
00:54:43,975 --> 00:54:48,105
15,000?
- Yes, 15,000.

362
00:54:49,481 --> 00:54:54,282
But you have your precious
brother back.

363
00:54:55,487 --> 00:54:57,455
What more could you want?

364
00:54:57,656 --> 00:55:01,456
We don't want a brother,
we want money.

365
00:55:01,660 --> 00:55:03,457
We can't eat him.

366
00:55:12,671 --> 00:55:15,139
Vijay, my brother!

367
00:56:01,420 --> 00:56:03,615
ls he really Vijay?
Where's the proof?

368
00:56:04,055 --> 00:56:07,616
Sit down! Soon you'll say
that l'm not Sattar.

369
00:56:09,060 --> 00:56:11,460
How can we know that
he is Vijay?

370
00:56:13,165 --> 00:56:15,963
What about the suicide?
We prove it.

371
00:56:20,338 --> 00:56:22,306
The neighbourhood knows,
Vijay is our brother.

372
00:56:22,674 --> 00:56:24,642
We say he is Vijay.

373
00:56:26,178 --> 00:56:30,308
And l confirm that he's my
boyhood friend.

374
00:56:30,682 --> 00:56:32,650
The great poet Vijay.

375
00:57:04,883 --> 00:57:12,016
The Vijay you wish
to welcome so warmly...

376
00:57:13,558 --> 00:57:18,359
...the Vijay for whom
you shout slogans...

377
00:57:19,564 --> 00:57:22,863
...l am not that Vijay.

378
00:57:27,806 --> 00:57:31,799
l'm not Vijay.
- Why deceive us?

379
00:57:32,277 --> 00:57:35,303
l said he was an imposter.

380
00:57:35,847 --> 00:57:37,815
A publicity-seeker. Hit him!

381
00:58:05,477 --> 00:58:10,505
''Burn it! Blow it asunder''

382
00:58:11,049 --> 00:58:13,347
''Burn it...''

383
00:58:13,885 --> 00:58:19,016
''blow the world asunder''

384
00:58:19,391 --> 00:58:24,693
''Take this world away
from my sight''

385
00:58:25,063 --> 00:58:30,296
''The world belongs to you,
you keep it''

386
00:58:45,517 --> 00:58:48,816
Are you mad?
What did you do?

387
00:58:49,020 --> 00:58:51,318
Tell these people you're Vijay,
there is still time.

388
00:59:00,031 --> 00:59:02,829
What's wrong?
They're all here for you.

389
00:59:03,368 --> 00:59:04,995
Why not tell them?

390
00:59:07,539 --> 00:59:09,507
l am not that Vijay.

391
00:59:10,709 --> 00:59:14,839
He is dead.
- What are you saying?

392
00:59:15,046 --> 00:59:19,676
All your friends say that you
are Vijay. Come to your senses.

393
00:59:21,386 --> 00:59:23,354
Friends?

394
00:59:24,389 --> 00:59:26,357
They are not my friends.

395
00:59:27,225 --> 00:59:29,193
They're friends of wealth.

396
00:59:30,996 --> 00:59:33,294
Once they refused to identify me.

397
00:59:35,000 --> 00:59:36,968
But now...

398
00:59:38,269 --> 00:59:41,295
Why turn against yourself
because of false friends?

399
00:59:42,007 --> 00:59:44,475
Why refuse fame and fortune...

400
00:59:44,843 --> 00:59:49,303
...when you can
repudiate those people?

401
00:59:49,681 --> 00:59:53,981
l have no complaint against
them or any human being.

402
00:59:54,853 --> 00:59:56,980
But against a society that...

403
00:59:57,689 --> 00:59:59,816
...denies the right to be human.

404
01:00:00,525 --> 01:00:04,484
That makes a brother
a stranger, a friend an enemy.

405
01:00:05,196 --> 01:00:08,825
l complain against a world
that worships no humans.

406
01:00:09,367 --> 01:00:11,335
But worships idols.

407
01:00:12,203 --> 01:00:14,671
That destroy humans
and tramples them.

408
01:00:16,374 --> 01:00:19,832
Where it is a crime to
share the sorrows of the poor.

409
01:00:20,712 --> 01:00:23,180
Where it is cowardice
to face troubles.

410
01:00:24,215 --> 01:00:28,015
ln such a world l shall never
be at peace, Meena.

411
01:00:29,387 --> 01:00:31,287
No peace, ever.

412
01:00:32,157 --> 01:00:35,285
That is why l am going away,
far away.

413
01:01:21,539 --> 01:01:23,837
Did someone call me?

414
01:01:27,879 --> 01:01:29,779
No one called. Sleep.

415
01:01:40,825 --> 01:01:44,625
Gulabo, where are going?
You're feverish.

416
01:01:45,330 --> 01:01:48,788
Someone called me.
Let me go.

417
01:02:43,321 --> 01:02:45,789
l am going far away, Gulabo.

418
01:02:46,991 --> 01:02:48,959
Where?

419
01:02:49,661 --> 01:02:51,788
Where l won't need to go any further.

420
01:02:55,834 --> 01:02:58,632
ls that what you came to say?

421
01:03:02,674 --> 01:03:04,642
Will you come?
