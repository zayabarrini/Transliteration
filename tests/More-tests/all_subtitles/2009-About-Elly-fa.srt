It was funny, huh?

13
00:02:05,860 --> 00:02:07,180
Yes, but I have to pee.

14
00:02:07,381 --> 00:02:09,371
That'll teach you to excite yourself like this.

15
00:02:09,580 --> 00:02:12,048
Stop somewhere if you can.

16
00:02:43,101 --> 00:02:45,568
Honey, you're not at school.
Don't bother poor Elly.

17
00:02:45,781 --> 00:02:48,454
It does not bother me.
I take her to the toilet.

18
00:02:51,620 --> 00:02:52,656
Shall I take this?

19
00:02:52,861 --> 00:02:54,738
- Didn't you tell the others?
- What?

20
00:02:55,020 --> 00:02:55,896
She was there.

21
00:02:56,101 --> 00:02:58,217
I didn't know it myself until last night.

22
00:02:58,580 --> 00:03:00,298
She doesn't even take too much room.

23
00:03:01,020 --> 00:03:02,613
- You okay?
- Yes, thank you.

24
00:03:03,020 --> 00:03:03,691
She's a nice woman.

25
00:03:03,900 --> 00:03:06,573
Wait one day.
and They'll all fall in love with her.

26
00:03:06,781 --> 00:03:07,850
Forget it, I'll do it.

27
00:03:08,100 --> 00:03:10,490
But no, I'm used to.

28
00:03:10,780 --> 00:03:11,656
Peyman!

29
00:03:12,901 --> 00:03:14,253
You drive too fast.

30
00:03:14,461 --> 00:03:16,452
- You drive too slow Amir!
- It's dangerous!

31
00:03:17,461 --> 00:03:18,529
Amir, is there something in the air?

32
00:03:18,740 --> 00:03:20,572
- What?
- That means you don't know?

33
00:03:20,781 --> 00:03:22,054
I swear, I don't know anything.

34
00:03:22,260 --> 00:03:24,934
Sepideh did not tell you
why she brought her?

35
00:03:25,141 --> 00:03:25,697
Not at all.

36
00:03:32,141 --> 00:03:35,451
You must promise me not to say anything
when we are together.

37
00:03:35,661 --> 00:03:38,095
Seriously, Ahmad,
it's a good girl.

38
00:03:38,301 --> 00:03:39,733
You really think so?

39
00:03:39,941 --> 00:03:41,169
She will turn your life upside down.

40
00:03:41,981 --> 00:03:43,334
You have seen this all in just 10 minutes?

41
00:03:44,461 --> 00:03:47,497
Sure. You can see it right away.
Not true, Naazy?

42
00:03:48,021 --> 00:03:48,817
It is natural.

43
00:03:49,340 --> 00:03:51,058
Already three votes.

44
00:03:51,261 --> 00:03:53,728
I said she was kind
nothing more.

45
00:03:53,941 --> 00:03:57,490
Wait until tomorrow, none of you will dislike her.

46
00:03:57,701 --> 00:03:59,816
Don't you worry about it. Let them do what they like.

47
00:04:00,021 --> 00:04:03,171
If you find any other girl like this, keep her for me.

48
00:04:03,381 --> 00:04:05,735
Could someone slap his head for me please?

49
00:04:07,381 --> 00:04:08,052
Manoochehr!

50
00:04:10,381 --> 00:04:11,814
Did you see this, Ahmad?

51
00:04:12,020 --> 00:04:12,896
Well done!

52
00:04:13,101 --> 00:04:14,499
You deserved it.

53
00:04:14,700 --> 00:04:16,657
Oh, really?

54
00:04:17,260 --> 00:04:20,094
Sepideh, does this girl know
that Ahmad was married before?

55
00:04:20,820 --> 00:04:21,776
I don't know.

56
00:04:21,981 --> 00:04:23,494
And that she forced him to divorce her?

57
00:04:24,180 --> 00:04:26,251
Well laugh a little.

58
00:04:26,461 --> 00:04:27,371
Stop, Peyman!

59
00:04:27,581 --> 00:04:28,615
What's her name again? Miss Elly!

60
00:04:30,901 --> 00:04:31,572
-Miss Elly!
-Peyman ...

61
00:04:31,941 --> 00:04:32,532
Elly!

62
00:04:32,741 --> 00:04:33,934
Stop!

63
00:04:34,700 --> 00:04:36,259
You're going to embarrass her, stop!

64
00:04:43,021 --> 00:04:45,091
Here is the charcoal samovar.

65
00:04:45,461 --> 00:04:48,498
Do you know how many years i haven't drunk
this kinda tea! Poor me!

66
00:04:48,700 --> 00:04:51,339
Ahmad, how did you do in
Germany?

67
00:04:51,541 --> 00:04:53,179
I lost my grip!

68
00:04:53,701 --> 00:04:55,931
That's why
your german wife left you.

69
00:04:56,781 --> 00:04:58,214
She told the judge:

70
00:04:58,901 --> 00:05:00,619
"Achtung! Pachtung" This man is mad! "

71
00:05:00,821 --> 00:05:01,731
Peyman!

72
00:05:02,341 --> 00:05:03,171
Am i lying?

73
00:05:04,181 --> 00:05:05,580
Amir could you help me?

74
00:05:05,781 --> 00:05:06,577
I'm going.

75
00:05:10,981 --> 00:05:12,333
So what?

76
00:05:12,701 --> 00:05:14,133
It's not you that I called ...

77
00:05:15,541 --> 00:05:17,054
- Was there a problem?
- Not at all

78
00:05:17,261 --> 00:05:20,298
You know, they are teasing and kidding a lot.
Please don't get anything wrong.

79
00:05:20,621 --> 00:05:21,371
Is that all?

80
00:05:21,581 --> 00:05:25,779
Builds up the group.
Enjoy a few of these three days.

81
00:05:25,981 --> 00:05:27,460
- Three days?
- Of course!

82
00:05:57,141 --> 00:05:58,415
Madam ...

83
00:06:02,701 --> 00:06:04,612
You see I was right
for the address.

84
00:06:04,822 --> 00:06:07,176
For once it's me
that's wrong ...

85
00:06:07,381 --> 00:06:10,179
Good morning.
Could you hand me the key to the villa?

86
00:06:10,381 --> 00:06:13,817
- The Villa in the forest?
- The same as last year.

87
00:06:14,181 --> 00:06:14,852
Bahri?

88
00:06:15,061 --> 00:06:16,938
You were all together?

89
00:06:17,141 --> 00:06:18,893
Yes, in college.

90
00:06:19,101 --> 00:06:20,500
My sister Naazy.
Here Elly.

91
00:06:20,701 --> 00:06:21,850
We already met.

92
00:06:22,061 --> 00:06:24,529
Really? Sure ...

93
00:06:24,741 --> 00:06:26,459
- Is it here?
- No, the key is here.

94
00:06:27,301 --> 00:06:29,178
Accompany them to the villa.

95
00:06:29,382 --> 00:06:32,657
We know the path.
We just need the key.

96
00:06:32,862 --> 00:06:34,135
How are you?

97
00:06:34,701 --> 00:06:36,294
Very well, thank you.

98
00:06:36,501 --> 00:06:38,696
Don't forget about tomorrow evening.

99
00:06:38,982 --> 00:06:40,654
- What?
- To leave earlier.

100
00:06:40,861 --> 00:06:42,340
Because the owner arrives in the afternoon
from Tehran.

101
00:06:42,981 --> 00:06:45,256
so you have to leave in the evening.

102
00:06:45,461 --> 00:06:46,895
But we want to stay three days.

103
00:06:47,101 --> 00:06:48,535
I already told one of on the phone.

104
00:06:48,741 --> 00:06:50,060
It was me.

105
00:06:50,342 --> 00:06:51,490
So we can't do anything about it?

106
00:06:51,701 --> 00:06:53,578
For us, it wouldn't be a problem.

107
00:06:53,782 --> 00:06:55,100
But it is the owner.

108
00:06:55,301 --> 00:06:56,973
He did not know
we wanted to stay for 3 days?

109
00:06:57,181 --> 00:06:59,172
We already told you on the phone.

110
00:07:00,501 --> 00:07:02,173
I thought you had all provided for!

111
00:07:02,461 --> 00:07:06,500
Everything was full. I took it
thinking that we could find something else.

112
00:07:06,701 --> 00:07:09,500
Something else?
At this time of year? That's impossible.

113
00:07:09,701 --> 00:07:11,134
I'm sorry.

114
00:07:11,342 --> 00:07:12,569
It's not your fault madam.

115
00:07:12,781 --> 00:07:14,499
Why didn't you tell me?

116
00:07:14,701 --> 00:07:17,215
If i said it, we weren't here now.

117
00:07:20,982 --> 00:07:22,096
It's okay.

118
00:07:22,301 --> 00:07:24,338
We will find some other place.

119
00:07:24,821 --> 00:07:28,097
At the phone, you didn't tell me that there is no chance.

120
00:07:28,301 --> 00:07:29,051
But if ...

121
00:07:29,261 --> 00:07:30,615
Can't you do anything?

122
00:07:30,821 --> 00:07:31,970
But what?

123
00:07:32,181 --> 00:07:35,491
If it was just us, we would find
some place to camped.

124
00:07:35,702 --> 00:07:39,580
But we have guests with us,
a pair of newlyweds.

125
00:07:40,062 --> 00:07:41,097
May God bless.

126
00:07:41,301 --> 00:07:45,260
The groom is from Germany.
It's something like a honeymoon.

127
00:07:45,462 --> 00:07:46,940
What about the villa of Mr.Mahmoudi?

128
00:07:47,142 --> 00:07:48,369
That is taken.

129
00:07:48,581 --> 00:07:50,060
We would go anywhere.

130
00:07:50,261 --> 00:07:52,457
- And the one at the beach?
- That of Sadeghian?

131
00:07:52,941 --> 00:07:55,660
- It dons' have any good windows or doors.
- you will be very cold at night.

132
00:07:55,862 --> 00:07:56,611
And it is dirty.

133
00:07:56,822 --> 00:07:58,460
We could clean it. Can we see the place?

134
00:07:58,662 --> 00:07:59,889
Go get the key from your uncle.

135
00:08:00,101 --> 00:08:01,614
Thank you very much.

136
00:08:19,861 --> 00:08:21,261
What a beautiful sea!

137
00:08:21,462 --> 00:08:22,941
What else, my mother?

138
00:08:24,261 --> 00:08:25,250
Arash.

139
00:08:34,342 --> 00:08:36,902
Are you sure it's the right key?

140
00:08:37,581 --> 00:08:40,812
Attention don't hurt yourself.
Here we go!

141
00:08:41,021 --> 00:08:43,297
Okay, Ahmad! It's open.

142
00:08:44,022 --> 00:08:45,500
How did you get in, you?

143
00:08:47,981 --> 00:08:49,573
Be careful not to fall.

144
00:09:11,262 --> 00:09:12,741
How filthy!

145
00:09:19,381 --> 00:09:20,610
Be Careful!

146
00:09:23,622 --> 00:09:26,090
Wow it's so huge.

147
00:09:27,301 --> 00:09:29,816
Be careful there's glass on the floor.

148
00:09:34,102 --> 00:09:35,820
The air conditioning works.

149
00:09:39,581 --> 00:09:41,095
Where are the toilets?

150
00:09:43,582 --> 00:09:45,856
It has no locks. Will you watch?

151
00:09:48,182 --> 00:09:50,855
If you use the toilet,
they won't take it back!

152
00:09:52,982 --> 00:09:54,210
Very funny ...

153
00:09:57,302 --> 00:10:00,339
We will spend our time
to do the housework. Careful!

154
00:10:00,541 --> 00:10:01,258
Do not worry!

155
00:10:03,742 --> 00:10:06,302
Hey little boy, are there gas containers here?

156
00:10:06,502 --> 00:10:09,574
- With a vacuum cleaner, This would go faster.
- You go sit down.

157
00:10:11,702 --> 00:10:13,499
Peyman, It will be cold at night.

158
00:10:13,701 --> 00:10:15,977
Just cover the windows with something.

159
00:10:16,182 --> 00:10:17,900
Wait, you're not alone.

160
00:10:18,702 --> 00:10:21,341
I can make a suggestion?

161
00:10:21,942 --> 00:10:24,250
- Tonight ...
- But it is good here!

162
00:10:24,462 --> 00:10:26,259
Just let me say sonething?

163
00:10:27,822 --> 00:10:29,301
Go ..

164
00:10:29,782 --> 00:10:33,012
We go into the other house tonight
and come back here tomorrow.

165
00:10:33,222 --> 00:10:35,816
We have to moved again then tomorrow!

166
00:10:40,021 --> 00:10:42,252
The toilets are not intimate
but they work!

167
00:10:42,502 --> 00:10:44,332
This is crucial!

168
00:10:46,542 --> 00:10:48,134
It's beautiful here.

169
00:10:48,342 --> 00:10:49,297
Beautiful.

170
00:10:51,942 --> 00:10:54,376
We can't spend
three days just thinking what to do!

171
00:10:54,742 --> 00:10:56,858
- Now what?
- We vote.

172
00:10:57,902 --> 00:10:59,335
Elly, what do you say?

173
00:10:59,542 --> 00:11:00,895
I take care of the cleaning.

174
00:11:01,102 --> 00:11:02,660
And you, Shohreh?

175
00:11:03,102 --> 00:11:06,094
I propose
we go look elsewhere.

176
00:11:06,302 --> 00:11:08,372
A vote against.
And you, Naazy?

177
00:11:08,582 --> 00:11:09,730
I am the voice of my master.

178
00:11:10,502 --> 00:11:11,298
Then her master?

179
00:11:11,542 --> 00:11:12,531
We should stay.

180
00:11:13,222 --> 00:11:14,177
And you, Peyman?

181
00:11:14,382 --> 00:11:16,532
I say no,
as my master.

182
00:11:16,741 --> 00:11:17,731
You're stupid!

183
00:11:18,502 --> 00:11:19,298
Two votes against.

184
00:11:19,502 --> 00:11:21,618
Two against five, we stay!

185
00:11:21,822 --> 00:11:23,460
And me, my vote
nobody cares ...

186
00:11:23,862 --> 00:11:26,057
Oh my!

187
00:11:44,182 --> 00:11:46,776
- Where are you going?
- I get a broom.

188
00:11:55,982 --> 00:11:57,415
Fetch the luggage?

189
00:11:57,622 --> 00:11:59,499
Lets clean up first.

190
00:11:59,702 --> 00:12:01,533
Once we start it will take a while.

191
00:12:01,942 --> 00:12:02,977
Sepideh?

192
00:12:03,702 --> 00:12:04,771
Do you have the keys?

193
00:12:19,902 --> 00:12:22,257
- Hey boy what is your name?
- Omid.

194
00:12:22,662 --> 00:12:24,857
Omid, are there any shops
around here?

195
00:12:25,063 --> 00:12:27,053
- What do you need Ahmad?
- Cigarettes.

196
00:12:32,102 --> 00:12:33,251
I'll handle this.

197
00:12:33,462 --> 00:12:35,930
Thank you.
Put it down, I'll take it.

198
00:12:36,222 --> 00:12:36,893
Arash!

199
00:12:37,102 --> 00:12:39,172
Come in, darling. You're soaked!

200
00:12:39,382 --> 00:12:41,418
Peyman, call your son.

201
00:12:44,062 --> 00:12:46,019
I will spend the whole weekend
looking after him.

202
00:12:46,222 --> 00:12:48,099
Relax! We came
with the whole band.

203
00:12:48,302 --> 00:12:52,012
I can't expect from everyone
not to go  to the sea because of our son.

204
00:12:52,502 --> 00:12:55,141
Come, my darling.

205
00:12:55,982 --> 00:12:58,416
Peyman, look if you find
the water heater.

206
00:12:58,622 --> 00:12:59,851
Isn't it inside?

207
00:13:00,622 --> 00:13:02,294
-No
-Then we have a problem

208
00:13:06,863 --> 00:13:08,056
Cutie!

209
00:13:20,943 --> 00:13:22,854
Yes? What's up?

210
00:13:40,542 --> 00:13:41,531
So?

211
00:13:42,182 --> 00:13:42,820
Sorry

212
00:13:43,142 --> 00:13:44,656
- You scared me.
- Sorry!

213
00:13:45,423 --> 00:13:46,412
I'll throw it away.

214
00:13:47,782 --> 00:13:50,455
- Does it fit through?
- Yes, i think so.

215
00:13:51,543 --> 00:13:53,340
Up.

216
00:13:53,822 --> 00:13:56,701
- It doesn't fit. Wait.
- No, it's locked.

217
00:13:57,142 --> 00:13:58,370
Give me that.

218
00:13:58,583 --> 00:14:00,698
No it doesn't work!

219
00:14:00,902 --> 00:14:02,574
Bend it a little.

220
00:14:05,942 --> 00:14:07,660
You see, it worked!

221
00:14:08,502 --> 00:14:09,696
I come and help.

222
00:14:11,623 --> 00:14:13,341
Wait, you'll cut yourself!

223
00:14:15,742 --> 00:14:17,654
Be careful not to cut yourself.

224
00:14:19,663 --> 00:14:21,460
I'm here, Morvarid.

225
00:14:25,943 --> 00:14:27,091
Sepideh!

226
00:14:28,022 --> 00:14:29,138
Who sleeps where?

227
00:14:29,343 --> 00:14:31,732
Who cares. We do as we can.

228
00:14:31,943 --> 00:14:35,059
Women in the rooms,
and husbands in the living-room.

229
00:14:35,263 --> 00:14:36,775
I am not separating from my wife.

230
00:14:36,983 --> 00:14:38,301
Then you both in the living room.

231
00:14:38,502 --> 00:14:40,573
- Shohreh?
- Yes?

232
00:14:41,022 --> 00:14:41,738
I'm coming.

233
00:14:42,383 --> 00:14:44,577
We will spend a hell of a night!

234
00:14:44,783 --> 00:14:46,295
We'll dance to keep warm.

235
00:14:46,823 --> 00:14:48,336
And those who can not dance?

236
00:14:48,543 --> 00:14:49,816
We'll teach you.

237
00:15:34,983 --> 00:15:36,496
Go get her!

238
00:15:37,343 --> 00:15:38,981
- What?
- Go ahead., Run!

239
00:15:39,903 --> 00:15:42,291
Don't let the opportunity pass!

240
00:15:42,503 --> 00:15:44,539
It won't look good!

241
00:15:56,983 --> 00:15:59,656
Ok leave me. I'll go.

242
00:16:29,183 --> 00:16:30,298
Arash!

243
00:16:31,423 --> 00:16:33,061
Get out of the water, quick!

244
00:16:34,223 --> 00:16:35,053
Go see in the kitchen.

245
00:16:35,263 --> 00:16:37,697
Well, Ahmad, your smokes.

246
00:16:38,543 --> 00:16:40,056
Come back here! Hurry!

247
00:16:40,263 --> 00:16:41,537
Go get him.

248
00:16:42,663 --> 00:16:44,699
I said come here, you rogue!

249
00:16:46,583 --> 00:16:48,175
You're all wet!

250
00:16:50,823 --> 00:16:53,212
Look at that!

251
00:16:53,423 --> 00:16:54,617
Elly!

252
00:16:56,943 --> 00:16:58,501
- Looking for the lady?
- Yes.

253
00:16:58,783 --> 00:17:00,182
She went to phone.

254
00:17:00,383 --> 00:17:02,101
There 's no mobile phone connection here.

255
00:17:03,223 --> 00:17:06,135
Stop screaming.
Hurry.

256
00:17:06,743 --> 00:17:09,815
You have to go buy light bulbs.

257
00:17:13,103 --> 00:17:16,733
Ahmad, listen!
Elly went to phone.

258
00:17:16,943 --> 00:17:19,093
Take her for a ride.

259
00:17:19,303 --> 00:17:21,101
Leave her a little peace.

260
00:17:21,303 --> 00:17:22,656
There is still no hot water.

261
00:17:22,864 --> 00:17:24,899
I put the water heater on. It's coming.

262
00:17:25,103 --> 00:17:26,456
The 3 Days will pass soon

263
00:17:26,663 --> 00:17:27,493
and you didn't do a thing.

264
00:17:31,303 --> 00:17:32,213
What are you looking for?

265
00:17:32,423 --> 00:17:34,141
Ahmad goes shopping.

266
00:17:34,343 --> 00:17:36,379
I told him
to fuel the car.

267
00:17:37,503 --> 00:17:38,982
Here, the keys.

268
00:17:40,543 --> 00:17:45,173
I come back tomorrow.
I'll be there around midnight.

269
00:17:46,623 --> 00:17:48,534
By bus, yes.

270
00:17:49,144 --> 00:17:51,532
Do not worry.
I will be with a colleague.

271
00:17:53,743 --> 00:17:54,937
She's fine.

272
00:17:55,143 --> 00:17:59,136
Mom, if someone calls,
don't say that I left town.

273
00:17:59,823 --> 00:18:02,179
Say you don't know where I am.

274
00:18:02,383 --> 00:18:04,339
Do you still have any pain?

275
00:18:05,063 --> 00:18:06,543
Love.

276
00:18:07,983 --> 00:18:11,977
Yes, I am careful.
We're all colleagues, I say.

277
00:18:12,263 --> 00:18:13,332
Okay.

278
00:18:13,863 --> 00:18:16,855
I'll call you.
There 's no connection here.

279
00:18:17,303 --> 00:18:19,021
We talk later.

280
00:18:19,864 --> 00:18:22,138
Love. Goodbye.

281
00:18:22,983 --> 00:18:24,099
Could  you call?

282
00:18:24,383 --> 00:18:25,783
Yes, thank you.

283
00:18:26,503 --> 00:18:27,458
Was she worried?

284
00:18:27,664 --> 00:18:31,861
My mom is always worried.
She just had a heart surgery.

285
00:18:32,064 --> 00:18:33,382
Recently?

286
00:18:33,583 --> 00:18:38,214
A month ago. The doctor
told her to avoid stress.

287
00:18:38,423 --> 00:18:41,017
If I had called 1 hour later,
she probably would have had a heart attack!

288
00:18:44,503 --> 00:18:48,178
"Hi, Mom.
Yes, I'm fine and you?

289
00:18:48,383 --> 00:18:50,613
"Of course I eat ..."

290
00:18:50,823 --> 00:18:54,213
She thought I was dying of hunger in
Germany.

291
00:18:54,423 --> 00:18:56,778
Once at the airport,
they opened my suitcase.

292
00:18:57,264 --> 00:18:59,413
A jar of pickles
broke!

293
00:18:59,623 --> 00:19:02,296
It reeked of vinegar!
I was ashamed of my life!

294
00:19:02,784 --> 00:19:05,058
She must be happy
that you came back.

295
00:19:06,824 --> 00:19:08,381
She died two years ago.

296
00:19:09,263 --> 00:19:10,413
I'm Sorry.

297
00:19:11,103 --> 00:19:14,254
When I was in the midst of a divorce.

298
00:19:15,463 --> 00:19:17,101
She has suffered, poor one.

299
00:19:21,343 --> 00:19:23,140
I can ask a delicate question?

300
00:19:25,464 --> 00:19:27,295
Is it about my honor?

301
00:19:28,024 --> 00:19:28,661
No.

302
00:19:29,864 --> 00:19:30,774
Go ..

303
00:19:32,983 --> 00:19:34,099
Why did you separate?

304
00:19:37,023 --> 00:19:37,978
From which one?

305
00:19:39,703 --> 00:19:41,455
You are not obliged to answer me.

306
00:19:41,864 --> 00:19:43,342
Why are you Interested?

307
00:19:45,664 --> 00:19:48,132
I do not know.
To find out, anyway ...

308
00:19:48,904 --> 00:19:50,302
To find out anyway ...

309
00:19:51,704 --> 00:19:55,174
One morning we woke up,
we took our shower,

310
00:19:55,743 --> 00:19:58,736
and at breakfast, she said:
"Achmed,

311
00:20:01,024 --> 00:20:04,140
"Besser ein Ende mit Schrecken ...

312
00:20:05,303 --> 00:20:07,260
"..als ein Schrecken ohne Ende."

313
00:20:10,184 --> 00:20:11,060
What?

314
00:20:11,423 --> 00:20:12,333
Go ahead. Repeat.

315
00:20:12,544 --> 00:20:14,102
- What?
- Besser ...

316
00:20:15,703 --> 00:20:17,615
ein Ende mit Schrecken ...

317
00:20:20,183 --> 00:20:22,061
I can not, sorry!

318
00:20:22,984 --> 00:20:24,496
You want me to stop?

319
00:20:25,504 --> 00:20:27,858
No, I know who it is.
I call back later.

320
00:20:29,583 --> 00:20:30,983
So what does it mean?

321
00:20:31,744 --> 00:20:35,019
A bitter end is much better than
a bitterness without ending.

322
00:20:39,144 --> 00:20:40,372
It's true.

323
00:20:43,504 --> 00:20:44,778
A little music.

324
00:21:08,464 --> 00:21:10,614
- You're so late.
- A little, yes.

325
00:21:11,504 --> 00:21:12,937
Did you have fun, Ahmad?

326
00:21:13,144 --> 00:21:14,020
Good morning.

327
00:21:15,504 --> 00:21:19,656
Arash, help bring these inside, little man?

328
00:21:19,864 --> 00:21:21,741
At night it's cold.

329
00:21:24,384 --> 00:21:26,295
Here is the bed for the newlyweds.

330
00:21:26,503 --> 00:21:27,903
We are all newlyweds!

331
00:21:28,104 --> 00:21:29,822
But the all-new

332
00:21:30,063 --> 00:21:31,543
lovebirds ...

333
00:21:32,264 --> 00:21:34,300
Where are they? Show them to me.

334
00:21:35,824 --> 00:21:39,942
Congratulations!
I wish you happiness!

335
00:21:48,144 --> 00:21:49,213
What are you doing?

336
00:21:54,184 --> 00:21:55,299
You have dinner with us?

337
00:21:55,504 --> 00:21:58,974
No thank you.
Just keep the doors locked.

338
00:21:59,184 --> 00:22:03,018
And your cars
are not protected here.

339
00:22:03,464 --> 00:22:04,613
Dinner is served.

340
00:22:08,144 --> 00:22:10,977
Go. I shut the door.

341
00:22:12,904 --> 00:22:17,341
Eat well, Ahmad.
You will not get this food in Germany.

342
00:22:17,544 --> 00:22:18,977
Especially not for free!

343
00:22:19,704 --> 00:22:21,581
Children, come!

344
00:22:21,784 --> 00:22:24,298
Why are you standing. Go sit down.

345
00:22:24,584 --> 00:22:25,983
Come on, Elly.

346
00:22:26,184 --> 00:22:27,412
Ahmad, make a little room.

347
00:22:28,744 --> 00:22:30,143
- It's ok here.
- Go ahead dear.

348
00:22:30,344 --> 00:22:32,255
Ahmad is going to be sad.

349
00:22:32,504 --> 00:22:33,983
Manoochehr!

350
00:22:35,665 --> 00:22:36,938
Push yourself a little.

351
00:22:41,504 --> 00:22:43,415
Does anyone need anything?

352
00:22:44,744 --> 00:22:45,460
I'm coming.

353
00:22:45,704 --> 00:22:48,138
- I get you some salad?
- I will do it, thank you.

354
00:22:48,344 --> 00:22:50,733
- You are shy.
- No, I am ok.

355
00:22:52,904 --> 00:22:53,734
Here.

356
00:22:56,424 --> 00:22:57,379
Are you crazy?

357
00:22:58,944 --> 00:23:01,174
Don't use it all. It's for the toilet.

358
00:23:02,264 --> 00:23:03,583
Eh, Amir!

359
00:23:03,784 --> 00:23:04,899
- The toilet?
- We're at the table!

360
00:23:05,104 --> 00:23:06,093
And the salt?

361
00:23:06,584 --> 00:23:07,937
It's in the kitchen.

362
00:23:08,144 --> 00:23:08,974
Manoochehr, c'mon.

363
00:23:09,424 --> 00:23:10,653
I forgot the salt?

364
00:23:14,225 --> 00:23:16,340
You've washed your hands, my cowboy?

365
00:23:20,424 --> 00:23:21,413
Please take some.

366
00:23:25,064 --> 00:23:26,497
Congratulations.

367
00:23:31,344 --> 00:23:33,381
Long live the newlyweds

368
00:23:45,024 --> 00:23:46,013
Eat, it cools.

369
00:23:59,585 --> 00:24:01,620
Elly, dear did you find it?

370
00:24:11,184 --> 00:24:12,777
Thank you, how nice.

371
00:24:13,264 --> 00:24:14,539
Who wants salt?

372
00:24:16,584 --> 00:24:19,382
Enough.
Put this on hold.

373
00:24:20,505 --> 00:24:23,780
Why are you guys out here alone?

374
00:24:23,985 --> 00:24:26,783
Ahmad, what are you doing here?
Stand up!

375
00:24:26,984 --> 00:24:27,497
Why?

376
00:24:27,705 --> 00:24:29,457
- How did it go?
- What?

377
00:24:29,664 --> 00:24:31,098
When you were out.

378
00:24:31,305 --> 00:24:34,262
He is already stiff crazy about her.

379
00:24:35,425 --> 00:24:37,699
I'm in love

380
00:24:37,904 --> 00:24:41,453
Passionately in love

381
00:24:41,665 --> 00:24:43,223
Stop it. Seriously.

382
00:24:44,544 --> 00:24:48,139
At the end of the weekend, we will vote.
If the majority says yes,

383
00:24:48,344 --> 00:24:50,062
I'll ask for her hand.
If not, no.

384
00:24:50,265 --> 00:24:51,300
The majority, is them?

385
00:24:51,504 --> 00:24:53,700
We, we all agree.

386
00:24:53,905 --> 00:24:55,223
And you, Amir?

387
00:24:55,705 --> 00:24:58,344
- It's not my business.
- Give your opinion.

388
00:24:58,864 --> 00:25:00,696
- She is a nice girl.
- Is that all?

389
00:25:01,224 --> 00:25:02,624
Yeah.

390
00:25:03,425 --> 00:25:05,336
She is warm, quiet.
I like her.

391
00:25:05,544 --> 00:25:06,978
- Really?
- Yes.

392
00:25:07,185 --> 00:25:08,299
Seriously?

393
00:25:10,784 --> 00:25:12,536
She seems uncomplicated.

394
00:25:13,065 --> 00:25:14,020
And you, Manoochehr?

395
00:25:15,105 --> 00:25:16,298
She is nice.

396
00:25:17,184 --> 00:25:18,618
-Can I say?
- Ok

397
00:25:19,824 --> 00:25:21,019
You laugh at me.

398
00:25:24,184 --> 00:25:25,014
She is great.

399
00:25:25,225 --> 00:25:26,943
- Really?
- I swear.

400
00:25:27,345 --> 00:25:29,255
I'm going, you can talk now.

401
00:25:30,064 --> 00:25:32,658
Can you bring us
two teas please?

402
00:25:32,864 --> 00:25:34,298
Come join your families instead!

403
00:25:34,504 --> 00:25:35,938
No, don't touch it!

404
00:25:36,145 --> 00:25:37,338
Fire! Fire!

405
00:25:40,145 --> 00:25:41,543
What did you do to us?

406
00:25:43,625 --> 00:25:44,819
Stop exploiting my girlfriend.

407
00:25:45,024 --> 00:25:46,901
It's your girlfriend she won't stop.

408
00:25:47,105 --> 00:25:48,857
We like you even if you do nothing.

409
00:25:49,065 --> 00:25:51,499
- Give this it to me.
- I wanted to make some tea ...

410
00:25:51,785 --> 00:25:52,740
I leave it there.

411
00:25:52,944 --> 00:25:56,062
Come on, girls.
We'll do that tomorrow.

412
00:25:56,384 --> 00:25:58,580
- Come, let's sit.
- We will.

413
00:26:01,305 --> 00:26:03,694
- How do you find her?
- She is nice.

414
00:26:03,905 --> 00:26:05,782
A little too reserved, no?

415
00:26:05,984 --> 00:26:07,384
She is embarrassed, poor one.

416
00:26:09,305 --> 00:26:10,738
Four words.

417
00:26:13,345 --> 00:26:14,300

00:27:00,945 --> 00:27:01,934
Mother?

434
00:27:02,545 --> 00:27:04,217
The mother of the honey bee!

435
00:27:10,225 --> 00:27:11,578
Two words?

436
00:27:11,785 --> 00:27:13,184
Is it two words, my honey?

437
00:27:15,105 --> 00:27:17,061
Mother?
Child?

438
00:27:18,145 --> 00:27:18,816

459
00:28:23,985 --> 00:28:26,944

460
00:28:27,265 --> 00:28:28,414

I go inside, folks.

465
00:29:07,465 --> 00:29:08,614
- Why?
- I have to care of something.

466
00:29:08,826 --> 00:29:10,543
We were about to crush them.

467
00:29:14,345 --> 00:29:15,573
Here we go!

468
00:29:40,585 --> 00:29:41,336
Elly!

469
00:29:44,305 --> 00:29:46,216
We go shopping.
Do you need anything?

470
00:29:46,426 --> 00:29:47,461
Two minutes, I come too.

471
00:29:47,665 --> 00:29:50,259
- Tell me what you need.
- Ineed to get my ticket.

472
00:29:51,145 --> 00:29:52,260
In your dreams!

473
00:29:52,465 --> 00:29:53,181
Shohreh ...

474
00:29:54,506 --> 00:29:55,904
Sepideh ...

475
00:29:56,865 --> 00:29:57,901
Wait ...

476
00:29:59,706 --> 00:30:00,695
Arash.

477
00:30:02,105 --> 00:30:03,584
No, it's impossible

478
00:30:03,785 --> 00:30:07,141
- Close the door.
- There is nobody, come on.

479
00:30:11,066 --> 00:30:12,498
I really have to go back this afternoon.

480
00:30:12,706 --> 00:30:13,616
No, it's impossible

481
00:30:13,826 --> 00:30:15,702
Don't you like it here Elly?

482
00:30:15,905 --> 00:30:17,497
No, Naazy, it was expected.

483
00:30:17,705 --> 00:30:19,822
I said
I would stay just one night.

484
00:30:20,025 --> 00:30:21,459
The guys should clean up.

485
00:30:21,666 --> 00:30:23,258
Arash, you stay beside the water.

486
00:30:23,905 --> 00:30:25,134
What an outfit.

487
00:30:25,345 --> 00:30:27,576
What a short journey for you then.

488
00:30:27,786 --> 00:30:30,857
You won't find a bus.
You'll have to walk home.

489
00:30:31,146 --> 00:30:32,704
- Then I will.
- By foot?

490
00:30:33,786 --> 00:30:35,013
Come on, lady!

491
00:30:35,865 --> 00:30:38,221
My mom is going to argue, my dear.

492
00:30:38,425 --> 00:30:39,745
You come, Shohreh?

493
00:30:40,026 --> 00:30:41,424
Sepideh ...

494
00:30:44,426 --> 00:30:46,098
I would stay if I could.

495
00:30:46,305 --> 00:30:48,536
- You must stay.
- My mother will be worried.

496
00:30:48,945 --> 00:30:51,938
- Naazy, you watch the children?
- Yes.

497
00:30:52,146 --> 00:30:54,660
I tell her
that you have been kept by force.

498
00:30:55,345 --> 00:30:58,655
If it's like that
I'll grab a taxi by the side of the road.

499
00:30:58,865 --> 00:31:00,503
I really have to leave.

500
00:31:00,706 --> 00:31:03,902
If she wants to leave
don't force her, Sepideh.

501
00:31:04,586 --> 00:31:07,338
I wish I could stay.
Sepideh knows why.

502
00:31:07,986 --> 00:31:10,546
We came together.
And we leave together.

503
00:31:11,865 --> 00:31:13,777
- 'Till later

504
00:31:23,386 --> 00:31:25,217
Amir ... keys!

505
00:31:26,986 --> 00:31:28,384
Amir, where are the keys?

506
00:31:28,585 --> 00:31:29,985
On the terrace, with my mobile phone.

507
00:31:35,986 --> 00:31:37,304
Give it, be nice...

508
00:31:38,065 --> 00:31:38,703
Be nice ...

509
00:31:59,306 --> 00:32:00,818
Arash, darling ...

510
00:32:01,986 --> 00:32:03,260
- Don't go further away.
- Okay.

511
00:32:03,465 --> 00:32:06,503
Play a little and go inside.

512
00:32:13,065 --> 00:32:16,297
Naazy, watch him, please.

513
00:32:16,585 --> 00:32:18,224
Don't forget the onions.

514
00:32:22,066 --> 00:32:23,419
What did she say?

515
00:32:23,625 --> 00:32:25,582
To buy onions.

516
00:32:47,506 --> 00:32:50,862
Relax,
we'll make a good soup tonight.

517
00:32:51,226 --> 00:32:52,625
Nice ring.

518
00:32:52,826 --> 00:32:53,497
Thank you.

519
00:32:53,706 --> 00:32:56,982
Elly dear, please watch the children?
I'll clean up a little.

520
00:33:09,586 --> 00:33:10,985
What's up?

521
00:33:11,626 --> 00:33:13,025
Please fix it for me.

522
00:33:13,226 --> 00:33:14,375
Ok.

523
00:34:07,786 --> 00:34:08,855
Come hold it.

524
00:34:09,866 --> 00:34:11,015
I have to go now.

525
00:34:32,786 --> 00:34:33,981
Daddy!

526
00:34:44,946 --> 00:34:46,345
Yes, darling?

527
00:34:46,786 --> 00:34:48,538
Daddy! Arash!

528
00:34:49,667 --> 00:34:51,896
Come here.
Let Arash alone.

529
00:34:52,227 --> 00:34:53,216
Arash ...

530
00:34:53,987 --> 00:34:55,977
Itake care of your dad, here!

531
00:34:57,507 --> 00:34:59,542
Daddy! Daddy!

532
00:35:00,906 --> 00:35:02,544
- Dad, Arash!
- Morvarid?

533
00:35:02,947 --> 00:35:05,824
Arash is in the water!

534
00:35:10,986 --> 00:35:12,055
Arash!

535
00:35:24,266 --> 00:35:25,461
Where is Arash?

536
00:35:25,667 --> 00:35:26,383
There!

537
00:35:26,587 --> 00:35:27,224
My God!

538
00:35:27,427 --> 00:35:29,861
He was in the water?
Who watched you?

539
00:35:30,747 --> 00:35:31,974
Go see
if he is inside!

540
00:35:33,427 --> 00:35:34,859
Arash!

541
00:35:35,067 --> 00:35:35,623
Is he here?

542
00:35:38,106 --> 00:35:38,936
He is in the water!

543
00:35:44,186 --> 00:35:45,175
Amir!

544
00:35:49,586 --> 00:35:50,541
His shoes!

545
00:35:53,747 --> 00:35:54,815
Manoochehr!

546
00:36:00,226 --> 00:36:01,215
Manoochehr!

547
00:36:22,587 --> 00:36:24,577
Ahmad! Ahmad!

548
00:36:24,827 --> 00:36:25,816
Ahmad!

549
00:36:33,067 --> 00:36:34,944
On the other side!

550
00:36:35,146 --> 00:36:36,135
To your left!

551
00:36:37,026 --> 00:36:38,858
He is there, Ahmad!

552
00:36:54,346 --> 00:36:55,018
He is here!

553
00:37:28,907 --> 00:37:31,785
Look it breathes.

554
00:37:33,027 --> 00:37:34,858
Look if he breathes!

555
00:38:03,187 --> 00:38:04,335
Put him there.

556
00:38:07,387 --> 00:38:09,423
On the side,
to empty the lungs.

557
00:38:10,267 --> 00:38:11,586
Raise his head.

558
00:38:22,667 --> 00:38:24,146
Wake up, my son!

559
00:38:24,547 --> 00:38:25,423
Arash!

560
00:38:46,987 --> 00:38:50,297
You've left the Children like that?
Where were their mothers?

561
00:38:50,507 --> 00:38:51,986
Elly was with them.

562
00:39:13,907 --> 00:39:14,896
Ahmad!

563
00:39:19,787 --> 00:39:20,936
Elly!

564
00:39:22,347 --> 00:39:24,338
- Was she in the water?
-Morvarid was playing, she didn't see her.

565
00:39:25,547 --> 00:39:27,617
Morvarid!
Where was Elly?

566
00:39:27,508 --> 00:39:28,542
- Inside?
- No.

567
00:39:28,747 --> 00:39:30,499
And if she was with Arash?

568
00:39:35,627 --> 00:39:36,377
Elly!

569
00:39:38,028 --> 00:39:39,426
What happened?

570
00:39:42,027 --> 00:39:43,222
Naazy?

571
00:39:44,227 --> 00:39:45,216
What ...

572
00:39:50,027 --> 00:39:51,097
Arash!

573
00:39:52,507 --> 00:39:54,225
Was Elly in the water with you?

574
00:39:54,427 --> 00:39:55,417
Why?

575
00:39:55,627 --> 00:39:58,062
- Hey, was she in the water, too?
- She dissappeared!

576
00:40:12,068 --> 00:40:14,342
Young man, help!

577
00:40:14,788 --> 00:40:17,142
Run! Go ahead. "

578
00:40:22,947 --> 00:40:23,902
What a catastrophe!

579
00:40:26,507 --> 00:40:27,144
Peyman?

580
00:40:32,387 --> 00:40:33,218
Arash?

581
00:40:41,868 --> 00:40:43,425
Don't be afraid.
It's Elly.

582
00:40:43,748 --> 00:40:44,702
Oh no!

583
00:40:45,388 --> 00:40:46,661
She wanted to save Arash ...

584
00:40:46,867 --> 00:40:47,823
Where is my son?

585
00:40:48,028 --> 00:40:48,904
Inside.

586
00:40:50,387 --> 00:40:51,377
Sepideh!

587
00:40:52,147 --> 00:40:53,546
Please help!

588
00:40:55,587 --> 00:40:57,020
Who is in the water?

589
00:40:57,227 --> 00:40:58,262
Elly!

590
00:40:59,107 --> 00:41:00,063
Elly?

591
00:41:05,107 --> 00:41:05,698
Sepideh!

592
00:41:06,827 --> 00:41:08,102
Do not go!

593
00:41:14,427 --> 00:41:15,099
Sepideh!

594
00:43:25,468 --> 00:43:26,617
What happened?

595
00:43:28,908 --> 00:43:31,786
- We didn't find her.
- Do not stop!

596
00:43:37,267 --> 00:43:38,826
The sea is rough.

597
00:43:39,027 --> 00:43:41,666
You can't just stop like that.

598
00:43:41,908 --> 00:43:44,262
Wait!
Take me.

599
00:43:47,108 --> 00:43:49,622
She may be trapped
between the rocks.

600
00:43:50,548 --> 00:43:51,947
Let us go!

601
00:43:52,748 --> 00:43:56,218
Take me, I beg you!

602
00:43:58,548 --> 00:44:00,823
You didn't look over there.

603
00:44:06,468 --> 00:44:08,299
That's where they found the child.

604
00:44:14,268 --> 00:44:16,543
We can not leave her like that.

605
00:44:17,468 --> 00:44:19,538
At daybreak
the sea will calm.

606
00:44:21,548 --> 00:44:25,746
Where are you going? I beg you.
She  may still be alive.

607
00:44:25,948 --> 00:44:28,508
We searched
for over half an hour.

608
00:44:28,708 --> 00:44:30,460
Pity! If she is alive ...

609
00:44:30,668 --> 00:44:32,420
She can't be alive anymore.

610
00:44:32,628 --> 00:44:35,096
Did i ask you?

611
00:44:35,308 --> 00:44:37,697
Sepideh! Go inside!

612
00:44:37,908 --> 00:44:39,182
Shohreh, take her!

613
00:44:41,828 --> 00:44:44,627
Peyman, don't let them leave.

614
00:44:44,828 --> 00:44:46,978
The sea will bring back the body.

615
00:44:47,188 --> 00:44:50,305
If you browse the beach tonight
you will find her.

616
00:44:51,468 --> 00:44:52,105
Sepideh!

617
00:45:53,108 --> 00:45:54,588
Sepideh.

618
00:45:59,228 --> 00:46:01,139
They want details
Her identity.

619
00:46:34,029 --> 00:46:37,544
She was playing with her kite
and she saw nothing.

620
00:46:37,748 --> 00:46:39,704
You've seen her go into the water?

621
00:46:39,908 --> 00:46:41,979
- No.
- What did you see?

622
00:46:42,308 --> 00:46:44,026
- Arash screaming in the water.
- And then?

623
00:46:44,228 --> 00:46:45,741
This is my son.

624
00:46:45,948 --> 00:46:49,224
I called my father
to come save him.

625
00:46:49,428 --> 00:46:52,501
Okay. Are you sure the woman
went in the water?

626
00:46:52,748 --> 00:46:55,387
I asked her
to watch the children.

627
00:46:55,588 --> 00:46:56,987
What was her name?

628
00:46:57,188 --> 00:46:58,860
- Elly.
- Elly?

629
00:46:59,828 --> 00:47:02,422
Elham Elnaz, Elmira ...?
The full name.

630
00:47:04,188 --> 00:47:06,145
Don't you know her?

631
00:47:06,349 --> 00:47:07,497
She called Elly.

632
00:47:07,708 --> 00:47:09,188
What was your relationship with her?

633
00:47:09,388 --> 00:47:14,463
It was my daughter's teacher.
My wife invited her.

634
00:47:14,708 --> 00:47:17,746
You don't know the name
of your daughter's teacher?

635
00:47:18,228 --> 00:47:19,548
I will ask.

636
00:47:20,628 --> 00:47:23,826
You bring
someone from Tehran

637
00:47:24,029 --> 00:47:25,905
without knowing anything about her

638
00:47:26,108 --> 00:47:28,100
and we
we have to rely on a child?

639
00:47:28,309 --> 00:47:29,502
What's her name?

640
00:47:29,989 --> 00:47:31,627
I don't know.

641
00:47:32,028 --> 00:47:33,667
You don't know her name?

642
00:47:41,748 --> 00:47:43,579
Unfortunately, she does not know.

643
00:47:44,829 --> 00:47:48,583
Have a look in her bag.
She must have any papers.

644
00:47:49,869 --> 00:47:52,861
I would like the identities
of you.

645
00:47:53,308 --> 00:47:55,379
And your papers, please.

646
00:47:56,788 --> 00:47:58,346
Who is the owner of the villa?

647
00:48:18,588 --> 00:48:19,658
Ahmad!

648
00:48:20,909 --> 00:48:22,501
Her bag is not there!

649
00:48:22,868 --> 00:48:24,461
Just search a little better.

650
00:48:24,668 --> 00:48:25,818
I searched, there is nothing!

651
00:48:26,428 --> 00:48:28,863
Naazy, give me Peyman's bag ...

652
00:48:29,189 --> 00:48:30,860
Shohreh, her bag is not there!

653
00:48:32,468 --> 00:48:33,948
It must be in her room.

654
00:48:41,669 --> 00:48:42,818
What if she left?

655
00:48:48,709 --> 00:48:49,778
Didn't you say she was with the kids?

656
00:48:50,629 --> 00:48:52,460
She was ready to go.

657
00:48:52,909 --> 00:48:55,342
She wanted to go by foot.
Not true, Shohreh?

658
00:48:55,589 --> 00:48:57,021
Would she leave
without saying goodbye?

659
00:48:57,229 --> 00:48:58,423
And why is her purse gone?

660
00:48:58,748 --> 00:49:00,421
My God ...

661
00:49:04,389 --> 00:49:05,344
Sepideh!

662
00:49:14,789 --> 00:49:15,539
What's her number?

663
00:49:15,749 --> 00:49:17,023
- Who?
- Elly.

664
00:49:17,229 --> 00:49:18,423
I'll call her cellphone.

665
00:49:18,629 --> 00:49:19,903
What are you talking about?

666
00:49:20,109 --> 00:49:21,144
- The bag ...
- What?

667
00:49:21,349 --> 00:49:23,704
It is not there.
Maybe she did really go.

668
00:49:23,909 --> 00:49:25,467
Nobody saw her going in the water.

669
00:49:31,829 --> 00:49:33,660
I had to keep it hidden.

670
00:49:44,909 --> 00:49:46,979
I should have let her go.

671
00:49:47,749 --> 00:49:50,104
I should have let her go.

672
00:49:52,669 --> 00:49:53,988
My God ...

673
00:50:33,469 --> 00:50:34,618
Mom!

674
00:51:06,309 --> 00:51:08,221
God curse you, Sepideh.

675
00:51:11,029 --> 00:51:13,590
We have to notify his family.

676
00:51:14,829 --> 00:51:17,060
Wait and see
if the body shows up tonight.

677
00:51:17,349 --> 00:51:19,659
Maybe she really has left.

678
00:51:19,869 --> 00:51:20,984
Left where?

679
00:51:21,749 --> 00:51:23,149
It's over.

680
00:51:24,070 --> 00:51:24,980
She died.

681
00:51:25,229 --> 00:51:26,583
We should call them tomorrow.

682
00:51:26,790 --> 00:51:29,826
They will not make the road
at night ...

683
00:51:30,349 --> 00:51:34,740
Today will be a lot of traffic.
It's gonna be hell.

684
00:51:38,990 --> 00:51:40,183
Oh my!

685
00:51:44,230 --> 00:51:45,298
Damn!

686
00:54:57,110 --> 00:54:58,145
Amir ...

687
00:55:03,710 --> 00:55:06,543
If she had drowned
we would have found the body.

688
00:55:07,270 --> 00:55:09,022
Wake up,
we must do something.

689
00:55:10,710 --> 00:55:12,302
You've done enough already.

690
00:55:12,510 --> 00:55:14,899
Wake up, I say.

691
00:55:17,710 --> 00:55:20,668
For what?
Well, I'm awake.

692
00:55:20,870 --> 00:55:23,179
Lets go look at the bus station.

693
00:55:23,390 --> 00:55:24,505
I don't know what to tell you ...

694
00:55:24,710 --> 00:55:26,189
Damn me.

695
00:55:26,390 --> 00:55:27,903
Yes damn me.

696
00:55:29,431 --> 00:55:32,866
There may be a chance
that she left.

697
00:55:33,390 --> 00:55:34,539
Listen, I'm talking to you.

698
00:55:34,750 --> 00:55:36,308
I don't want you to talk to me!

699
00:55:37,070 --> 00:55:38,583
You fucked up
and you want to talk?

700
00:55:38,790 --> 00:55:40,382
Listen, I'm exhausted, too.

701
00:55:41,430 --> 00:55:42,624
Why did you invite her?

702
00:55:43,110 --> 00:55:45,021
OK, it's my fault.
So what can we do now?

703
00:55:45,231 --> 00:55:47,061
Nothing more.

704
00:55:47,630 --> 00:55:49,143
You didn't need a consulter
for inviting her?

705
00:55:49,350 --> 00:55:51,545
- I thought that Ahmad ...
- Who are you, for Ahmad?

706
00:55:52,670 --> 00:55:54,103
His mother?

707
00:55:54,310 --> 00:55:56,506
His sister? Who are you?

708
00:56:04,870 --> 00:56:05,666
What's up Amir?

709
00:56:12,390 --> 00:56:13,903
Why should it be her fault?

710
00:56:14,111 --> 00:56:14,701
It's not her fault.

711
00:56:15,150 --> 00:56:16,630
Nothing ever is.

712
00:56:18,670 --> 00:56:19,944
I told her to invite Elly.

713
00:56:20,191 --> 00:56:21,828
You shouldn't have!

714
00:56:22,590 --> 00:56:24,182
Why didn't you ask someone else?

715
00:56:24,990 --> 00:56:25,945
You'll wake the children.

716
00:56:26,910 --> 00:56:29,140
For so many years
you don't know this fool?

717
00:56:29,350 --> 00:56:32,228
Who could have predicted
she would come with us ...

718
00:56:32,431 --> 00:56:34,262
She always takes care!

719
00:56:34,590 --> 00:56:36,546
You want to go to sea
Ask Sepideh!

720
00:56:36,751 --> 00:56:38,741
People want to meet:
Ask Sepideh!

721
00:56:38,950 --> 00:56:40,270
You look for a villa:
Sepideh!

722
00:56:40,470 --> 00:56:43,143
You need a ticket:
Sepideh!

723
00:56:43,630 --> 00:56:45,587
You wanna get married;
Sepideh!

724
00:56:49,071 --> 00:56:50,868
Go inside, we find a solution.

725
00:56:51,070 --> 00:56:52,708
Solution?

726
00:56:53,030 --> 00:56:55,339
He have to call the parents.

727
00:56:55,550 --> 00:56:58,303
Okay. For now let's go inside.

728
00:56:58,791 --> 00:57:02,261
Kids, the one who tells it the best
will get  a huge gift.

729
00:57:02,630 --> 00:57:06,066
Go ahead and start.
What you did, you?

730
00:57:06,270 --> 00:57:08,659
I was with my kite.

731
00:57:08,870 --> 00:57:09,461
And then?

732
00:57:09,670 --> 00:57:11,662
Arash was in the water.

733
00:57:12,310 --> 00:57:14,187
And where was Elly?

734
00:57:14,391 --> 00:57:15,460
She was up there.

735
00:57:15,750 --> 00:57:16,979
On the terrace.

736
00:57:17,191 --> 00:57:18,145
What were you doing?

737
00:57:18,350 --> 00:57:21,706
I asked her to
set my kite.

738
00:57:21,910 --> 00:57:25,824
She came and played with
the kite. And then I saw Arash.

739
00:57:28,070 --> 00:57:31,346
When your kite was up there

740
00:57:31,590 --> 00:57:33,103
was Elly with you?

741
00:57:33,310 --> 00:57:37,667
Look at me. When you, were there
was Elly staining over there,

742
00:57:37,871 --> 00:57:40,510
where Naazy is standing now?

743
00:57:41,030 --> 00:57:43,669
She was there at the beginning.

744
00:57:44,710 --> 00:57:46,143
And after?

745
00:57:46,831 --> 00:57:52,224
I ran after my kite to
the other side.

746
00:57:52,911 --> 00:57:55,744
And there I saw Arash.

747
00:57:55,950 --> 00:57:57,065
You saw Arash.

748
00:57:58,790 --> 00:58:00,065
Stop it, Arash.

749
00:58:01,390 --> 00:58:04,508
Anita? Have you Elly
leave the villa?

750
00:58:07,310 --> 00:58:09,141
- Look at me.
- I have not seen.

751
00:58:12,311 --> 00:58:13,824
Morvarid, darling,

752
00:58:14,031 --> 00:58:18,626
when your kite
fell into the water,

753
00:58:18,830 --> 00:58:20,422
and Arash was drowning,

754
00:58:20,630 --> 00:58:23,589
was Elly there?
Or was she leaving the house?

755
00:58:23,791 --> 00:58:25,509
- She was there.
- Okay.

756
00:58:26,951 --> 00:58:30,863
When you came to call
and we played volleyball,

757
00:58:31,070 --> 00:58:33,504
you know, when you cried,

758
00:58:33,710 --> 00:58:35,144
Elly was still there?

759
00:58:35,350 --> 00:58:37,181
She was there before that.

760
00:58:38,191 --> 00:58:39,589
Before, how long?

761
00:58:39,790 --> 00:58:40,540
A little.

762
00:58:40,750 --> 00:58:42,422
What is a little sweetie?

763
00:58:42,631 --> 00:58:44,303
1 to what?

764
00:58:44,511 --> 00:58:47,230
1 ... 2 ... 3 ... 4 ...?

765
00:58:48,390 --> 00:58:51,383
1 ... 2 ... 3 ...

766
00:58:53,710 --> 00:58:54,780
I don't know.

767
00:58:56,350 --> 00:58:57,466
And you, Arash, darling?

768
00:58:57,671 --> 00:59:01,027
When you were in the water,
Did Elly come to help you?

769
00:59:02,631 --> 00:59:03,984
Raise your head and answered correctly.

770
00:59:04,190 --> 00:59:05,179
I answered a hundred times yesterday.

771
00:59:05,391 --> 00:59:07,347
Sit down and answer well!

772
00:59:07,551 --> 00:59:09,223
- I'm hungry.
- Get out of here then!

773
00:59:09,711 --> 00:59:10,507
Peyman!

774
00:59:11,031 --> 00:59:13,306
What way is that to behave?

775
00:59:13,511 --> 00:59:16,071
- I was in the water, I saw nothing!

776
00:59:16,271 --> 00:59:17,385
What is wrong with you?

777
00:59:18,310 --> 00:59:19,744
He answers strangly!

778
00:59:19,950 --> 00:59:23,023
Since yesterday evening
you mistreat this child!

779
00:59:23,231 --> 00:59:25,620
That's it, go away and shut up.

780
00:59:27,311 --> 00:59:28,709
I am silent
and take everything?

781
00:59:28,911 --> 00:59:31,141
You let him alone at
the edge of the water!

782
00:59:31,430 --> 00:59:34,184
Has told you not to take
a villa on the beach!

783
00:59:36,751 --> 00:59:38,867
Anita, come.

784
00:59:51,911 --> 00:59:53,139
Any News?

785
00:59:54,150 --> 00:59:55,300
Nothing since yesterday evening.

786
00:59:56,750 --> 00:59:58,150
Why should she gone?

787
00:59:58,751 --> 01:00:00,343
Who knows.

788
01:00:01,351 --> 01:00:03,581
She would have taken her bag.

789
01:00:03,791 --> 01:00:05,462
But Sepideh had hidden it ...

790
01:00:06,991 --> 01:00:08,140
Sepideh,

791
01:00:08,551 --> 01:00:10,462
Could Elly have done such a thing?

792
01:00:10,911 --> 01:00:11,866
What thing?

793
01:00:12,511 --> 01:00:14,183
Leaving without saying anything.

794
01:00:15,271 --> 01:00:16,067
I don't know.

795
01:00:16,271 --> 01:00:18,831
Why you did you hide her bag,
then?

796
01:00:19,191 --> 01:00:22,183
You thought that she could
leave like that.

797
01:00:22,431 --> 01:00:26,504
The other night as she disappeared.
He was looking everywhere.

798
01:00:26,711 --> 01:00:28,747
It was because of her phone connection.

799
01:00:29,591 --> 01:00:31,024
She wanted to make a call.

800
01:00:31,351 --> 01:00:32,420
Without saying a word.

801
01:00:32,631 --> 01:00:34,701
- It's different.
- What?

802
01:00:34,991 --> 01:00:36,868
- Why should she leave?
- In spite.

803
01:00:37,071 --> 01:00:37,708
What?

804
01:00:38,071 --> 01:00:39,265
She may be upset.

805
01:00:41,511 --> 01:00:42,830
Why?

806
01:00:45,591 --> 01:00:50,028
Did anyone notice anything?
Or say anything upsetting to her?

807
01:00:50,231 --> 01:00:51,789
Dad, I'm hungry.

808
01:00:55,991 --> 01:00:59,301
The other night,
When I served grill

809
01:00:59,671 --> 01:01:00,626
and you arrived

810
01:01:00,831 --> 01:01:05,780
the lady brought the beds,
she began to clap and sing.

811
01:01:05,991 --> 01:01:08,061
And you, Shohreh,
you made noises.

812
01:01:08,831 --> 01:01:12,301
It seemed Elly was upset.

813
01:01:12,832 --> 01:01:15,471
Noises? It was a joke.

814
01:01:15,911 --> 01:01:17,139
I just thought.

815
01:01:17,351 --> 01:01:18,306
And for dinner?

816
01:01:19,231 --> 01:01:21,904
When she went to get the salt
we all laughed.

817
01:01:23,671 --> 01:01:25,902
But that was just a little fun.

818
01:01:26,111 --> 01:01:27,066
We all laughed.

819
01:01:27,271 --> 01:01:28,784
She too laughed.

820
01:01:28,991 --> 01:01:31,983
All this jokes, the dancing,

821
01:01:32,191 --> 01:01:33,146
Could that have embarrassed her?

822
01:01:33,351 --> 01:01:35,911
Yesterday morning
she insisted on leaving,

823
01:01:36,111 --> 01:01:37,669
as if she was worried about something.

824
01:01:37,871 --> 01:01:40,669
I told you not to force her to stay!

825
01:01:40,872 --> 01:01:42,384
She was just over there.

826
01:01:42,592 --> 01:01:44,389
You told heras a joke
she should go by foot

827
01:01:44,591 --> 01:01:46,150
and she said: "Ok i will."

828
01:01:54,271 --> 01:01:55,420
Sepideh?

829
01:01:56,111 --> 01:01:57,942
You who know her

830
01:01:58,151 --> 01:02:00,824
Was she such a person?

831
01:02:01,111 --> 01:02:02,430
To be offended and leave?

832
01:02:02,632 --> 01:02:03,825
Take offended by what?

833
01:02:04,392 --> 01:02:07,508
She doesn't even know her name.
How does she know?

834
01:02:07,711 --> 01:02:10,987
Amir, stop quibbling.
We try to move forward.

835
01:02:12,312 --> 01:02:16,384
When we did the dishes,
Sepideh, you said something,

836
01:02:16,911 --> 01:02:19,869
And Shohreh said:
"We like you even if you do nothing."

837
01:02:20,072 --> 01:02:21,629
I think that offended her.

838
01:02:23,752 --> 01:02:25,787
But I didn't mean any harm.

839
01:02:25,991 --> 01:02:30,269
I know. I say that there
may have been a misunderstanding.

840
01:02:30,511 --> 01:02:32,389
Please don't start
blaming me for that too!

841
01:02:32,592 --> 01:02:34,071
I didn't blame you.

842
01:02:34,272 --> 01:02:38,105
She must be very immature
to be offended by a sentence like that!

843
01:02:38,311 --> 01:02:39,107
Calm down, we are just talking!

844
01:02:39,312 --> 01:02:43,190
Did you see how they all look at
my son since yesterday evening?

845
01:02:43,391 --> 01:02:46,064
Nothing you said offended her.

846
01:02:46,271 --> 01:02:48,183
Ahmad, I talk about that!

847
01:02:48,391 --> 01:02:50,952
Even if she was offended,
that's not a reason to leave.

848
01:02:51,351 --> 01:02:53,023
If she is reasonable.

849
01:02:53,472 --> 01:02:55,986
But if she
really just left like that

850
01:02:56,192 --> 01:02:58,706
without saying anything, she really is a. ..

851
01:02:58,911 --> 01:02:59,787
Peyman ...

852
01:02:59,991 --> 01:03:03,951
We were told this place is open
to everybody. And if someone ...

853
01:03:04,151 --> 01:03:05,379
What are you talking here?

854
01:03:05,991 --> 01:03:08,347
Call Tehran,
see if she returned.

855
01:03:08,911 --> 01:03:11,550
It's too early. It's 7:30.

856
01:03:11,752 --> 01:03:14,709
So it is 7:30 !
I can't take it anymore.

857
01:03:14,911 --> 01:03:17,062
Ahmad, come, we'll call.

858
01:03:17,471 --> 01:03:19,861
No, you don't move.
Ahmad, you go alone.

859
01:03:20,231 --> 01:03:21,460
- Why?
- You stay here.

860
01:03:21,671 --> 01:03:23,548
- But how ...
- Don't make it worse!

861
01:03:23,751 --> 01:03:25,548
It is better a woman calls.

862
01:03:25,752 --> 01:03:27,504
Sepideh is the only woman here?

863
01:03:28,831 --> 01:03:30,549
I could go too.

864
01:03:31,431 --> 01:03:33,149
But if they say she's not back ...

865
01:03:34,271 --> 01:03:36,023
Just thinking about it, makes me shake.

866
01:03:36,232 --> 01:03:38,461
- Amir, let me ...
- I said no!

867
01:03:39,311 --> 01:03:40,506
Ahmad, let's go.

868
01:03:41,071 --> 01:03:41,743
I come with you.

869
01:03:42,191 --> 01:03:42,987
It's Okay, I'm going.

870
01:03:43,192 --> 01:03:44,465
Come Manoochehr.

871
01:03:45,712 --> 01:03:46,588
Ahmad ...

872
01:03:47,592 --> 01:03:49,707
Sepideh, you give me her home number?

873
01:03:53,511 --> 01:03:54,706
You want me to go with them?

874
01:03:54,912 --> 01:03:56,391
Ahmad is going.

875
01:03:57,192 --> 01:03:59,228
Go get a breakfast
for the children.

876
01:03:59,431 --> 01:04:01,662
They may stay one day
without breakfast.

877
01:04:01,872 --> 01:04:03,782
For one day, they will not die!

878
01:04:03,991 --> 01:04:05,186
Keys.

879
01:04:06,232 --> 01:04:07,266
What a weekend!

880
01:04:14,752 --> 01:04:17,060
Go ..
No, wait.

881
01:04:17,272 --> 01:04:18,591
The other wheel is also stuck.

882
01:04:20,952 --> 01:04:21,748
Ahmad!

883
01:04:21,952 --> 01:04:24,261
It's stuck in sand.

884
01:04:26,072 --> 01:04:28,108
Come down, we'll make it.

885
01:04:35,512 --> 01:04:38,151
If her mother answers, say nothing.

886
01:04:38,791 --> 01:04:39,746
Why?

887
01:04:40,511 --> 01:04:43,230
The other day she told me
she has heart problems.

888
01:04:43,432 --> 01:04:45,468
I don't wanna shock her.

889
01:04:48,992 --> 01:04:53,701
A foreign person drowned because of
our child. You understand that?

890
01:04:53,912 --> 01:04:56,745
And your only problem,
is to go on my nerves?

891
01:04:56,952 --> 01:04:58,670
Do not talk like that.

892
01:05:00,272 --> 01:05:02,832
I told you  a 100 times not
to talk to me like that in public.

893
01:05:03,032 --> 01:05:04,545
Like what?

894
01:05:04,912 --> 01:05:08,427
I have no other concern now?
How am i talking?

895
01:05:08,631 --> 01:05:09,951
Like you did before.

896
01:05:10,152 --> 01:05:12,427
I have always been the same
since college.

897
01:05:12,632 --> 01:05:15,430
And in twenty years,
I will still be the same shit i am now.

898
01:05:15,872 --> 01:05:17,021
I want to go to Tehran.

899
01:05:17,311 --> 01:05:19,303
- You can not ...
- I want to go.

900
01:05:24,992 --> 01:05:25,868
Shohreh ...

901
01:05:26,071 --> 01:05:27,823
I want to go.

902
01:05:28,112 --> 01:05:31,149
The sound of the sea
drives me crazy.

903
01:05:31,351 --> 01:05:33,468
My son peed his bed.

904
01:05:33,752 --> 01:05:35,742
Everyone disrespects him.

905
01:05:35,952 --> 01:05:37,351
Am more worse than you all.

906
01:05:37,712 --> 01:05:40,226
The image of this girl
does not leave me ...

907
01:05:40,432 --> 01:05:42,707
Sepideh, you have an aspirin?

908
01:05:42,912 --> 01:05:44,982
Take paracetamol in my bag.

909
01:05:51,912 --> 01:05:52,867
Aain her  mother.

910
01:05:53,072 --> 01:05:54,346
Do not hang up this time.

911
01:05:55,272 --> 01:05:56,466
You say it is her heart ...

912
01:05:56,672 --> 01:05:57,582
Just say that you are

913
01:05:57,792 --> 01:06:00,909
a student's parent
and you want to talk with her.

914
01:06:01,111 --> 01:06:03,831
At this hour?

915
01:06:04,752 --> 01:06:06,231
What if this province number shows up?

916
01:06:06,592 --> 01:06:08,150
Say you're the husband of a girlfriend.

917
01:06:08,352 --> 01:06:09,671
Sepideh should have come.

918
01:06:16,832 --> 01:06:19,300
What a honeymoon
I am so sorry ...

919
01:06:20,112 --> 01:06:21,784
Thank you, my boy.

920
01:06:23,712 --> 01:06:25,304
Honk.

921
01:06:28,432 --> 01:06:29,547
Where you going?

922
01:06:29,752 --> 01:06:31,105
I was worried.

923
01:06:31,312 --> 01:06:32,587
- Was she in Tehran?

924
01:06:32,792 --> 01:06:33,509
Get in.

925
01:06:35,912 --> 01:06:37,140
What happened?

926
01:06:37,512 --> 01:06:39,548
Did she have family problems?

927
01:06:39,752 --> 01:06:40,821
Why?

928
01:06:41,192 --> 01:06:42,784
Her mother was very evasive.

929
01:06:42,992 --> 01:06:44,505
She was not back then?

930
01:06:44,833 --> 01:06:46,585
She said she went out for a minute.

931
01:06:47,072 --> 01:06:49,223
Thank you, my God.

932
01:06:49,432 --> 01:06:50,501
No, wait.

933
01:06:50,712 --> 01:06:53,465
At first she said that
I asked if she returned from the trip.

934
01:06:53,672 --> 01:06:55,391
She said: "What trip?"

935
01:06:55,592 --> 01:06:57,503
- What?
- She lied to me.

936
01:06:57,993 --> 01:07:01,667
In addition, she said
that Elly left her mobile phone at home.

937
01:07:01,872 --> 01:07:03,464
But she had it with her.

938
01:07:04,392 --> 01:07:06,030
She asked me ten times
who I was.

939
01:07:06,472 --> 01:07:08,429
Did her family know
she came with us?

940
01:07:09,112 --> 01:07:12,104
Didn't she call her mother,
the other night?

941
01:07:12,312 --> 01:07:15,031
Yes, but her mother ...

942
01:07:15,553 --> 01:07:16,383
His mother ...

943
01:07:16,632 --> 01:07:19,864
She answered really suspicious.

944
01:07:20,072 --> 01:07:23,030
Maybe because we hung up
several times before she was suspicious.

945
01:07:23,232 --> 01:07:27,305
But if she had confidence in her daughter
why be suspecious?

946
01:07:28,272 --> 01:07:29,671
How long do you know her?

947
01:07:30,952 --> 01:07:32,385
Not long.

948
01:07:51,992 --> 01:07:53,108
What happened?

949
01:07:56,673 --> 01:07:58,311
Nobody piked up the phone.

950
01:07:58,512 --> 01:08:00,947
Damn what a bummer!

951
01:08:02,833 --> 01:08:04,709
You should've tried again.

952
01:08:04,952 --> 01:08:05,702
Ahmad ...

953
01:08:05,912 --> 01:08:08,506
We tried ten times.

954
01:08:14,033 --> 01:08:15,068
Sepideh.

955
01:08:15,432 --> 01:08:16,308
Come here.

956
01:08:22,272 --> 01:08:23,466
What's up?

957
01:08:28,153 --> 01:08:29,471
Where is her phone?

958
01:08:29,673 --> 01:08:30,742
Why?

959
01:08:30,952 --> 01:08:34,070
Let's call a number in
her phone.

960
01:08:34,273 --> 01:08:36,104
She's took it with her.

961
01:08:36,833 --> 01:08:37,822
Where's That?

962
01:08:38,032 --> 01:08:40,990
I don't know.
Why are you asking me this?

963
01:08:41,193 --> 01:08:42,341
Come here.

964
01:08:42,552 --> 01:08:45,066
- What is it?
- Tell me what you know about her.

965
01:08:45,272 --> 01:08:46,990
What I know about her?

966
01:08:49,273 --> 01:08:51,991
Whose is that?
It's hers, right?

967
01:08:52,272 --> 01:08:54,503
- Where was it?
- In your bag.

968
01:08:54,872 --> 01:08:56,750
Why is her mobile phone in your bag?

969
01:08:57,512 --> 01:08:58,388
I forgot.

970
01:08:58,593 --> 01:09:02,471
I found it yesterday
by the windows.

971
01:09:02,672 --> 01:09:04,743
Don't lie to me!

972
01:09:04,953 --> 01:09:06,101
What is wrong with you?

973
01:09:06,312 --> 01:09:07,587
Leave me alone.

974
01:09:07,792 --> 01:09:09,943
Stop! Asshole!

975
01:09:10,153 --> 01:09:13,861
What's the matter?
Why don't you speak?

976
01:09:14,313 --> 01:09:14,949
Bitch!

977
01:09:15,153 --> 01:09:17,666
Amir, are you not ashamed?
Get off!

978
01:09:18,113 --> 01:09:19,592
Don't you meddle with it!

979
01:09:19,793 --> 01:09:21,306
Don't you meddle with it, Shohreh.

980
01:09:21,832 --> 01:09:23,471
Get in the car.

981
01:09:24,392 --> 01:09:25,507
You should be ashamed!

982
01:09:25,713 --> 01:09:27,431
Get in the car.

983
01:09:27,633 --> 01:09:29,191
Peyman, lets return to Tehran.

984
01:09:29,632 --> 01:09:31,191
She is dead!

985
01:09:31,392 --> 01:09:33,065
Now you want
to kill us, too?

986
01:09:33,753 --> 01:09:34,901
I'm not staying here.

987
01:09:35,112 --> 01:09:37,672
- What did you do?
- She lies to me.

988
01:09:37,873 --> 01:09:39,271
I want to know ...

989
01:09:39,472 --> 01:09:41,940
Why is her phone
in your bag?

990
01:09:42,912 --> 01:09:43,628
What the hell?

991
01:09:43,832 --> 01:09:47,030
You'd better
shut up Ahmad.

992
01:09:47,993 --> 01:09:49,312
Leave it Ahmad.

993
01:09:49,513 --> 01:09:51,902
Nobody said anything here?

994
01:09:52,313 --> 01:09:54,827
You do as you like.
Me, I'm leaving!

995
01:09:55,032 --> 01:09:57,263
You go, Sepideh.

996
01:10:01,633 --> 01:10:02,702
Ahmad!

997
01:10:02,912 --> 01:10:04,187
Go back, please.

998
01:10:04,393 --> 01:10:06,587
Morvarid, go inside, my dear.

999
01:10:06,793 --> 01:10:07,703
Peyman ...

1000
01:10:10,792 --> 01:10:12,748
It makes me crazy.

1001
01:10:18,193 --> 01:10:22,664
We will send the women
and children in Tehran.

1002
01:10:27,033 --> 01:10:29,182
She forced me
to raise my hands on it.

1003
01:10:31,633 --> 01:10:33,588
We can't just leave.

1004
01:10:33,873 --> 01:10:35,430
Everybody wants to go.

1005
01:10:35,633 --> 01:10:37,271
Let's go, Mom.

1006
01:10:37,473 --> 01:10:39,111
It's hard for the kids.

1007
01:10:39,313 --> 01:10:41,507
You go ..
I've got to stay.

1008
01:10:41,833 --> 01:10:45,143
Sepideh,
your presence will not change anything.

1009
01:10:45,353 --> 01:10:46,991
I can not, Peyman.

1010
01:10:47,193 --> 01:10:48,706
Naazy ...

1011
01:10:48,913 --> 01:10:50,107
She's hurt.

1012
01:10:51,753 --> 01:10:53,983
Sepideh, listen to me a bit ...

1013
01:10:54,193 --> 01:10:56,309
No, Ahmad.

1014
01:10:56,513 --> 01:11:00,108
If this girl really just left
silently,

1015
01:11:00,313 --> 01:11:02,747
is it worth
you give yourself all this trouble?

1016
01:11:02,953 --> 01:11:05,102
For a girl you don't know nothing about?

1017
01:11:05,313 --> 01:11:07,031
- Peyman ...
- No, really?

1018
01:11:07,233 --> 01:11:08,063
Peyman.

1019
01:11:08,273 --> 01:11:11,743
And if she drowned because of Arash,
isn't she worth it?

1020
01:11:11,953 --> 01:11:15,582
Who says she drowned
for my Arash?

1021
01:11:15,793 --> 01:11:19,308
And i didn't even said
she should watch my child that ...

1022
01:11:19,753 --> 01:11:21,266
Let her, if she wants to stay.

1023
01:11:21,473 --> 01:11:23,191
We are discussing, Peyman.

1024
01:11:23,393 --> 01:11:25,190
Why bother?

1025
01:11:28,033 --> 01:11:33,187
Was it me who invited her to the sea
and who kept her from leaving?

1026
01:11:33,393 --> 01:11:35,702
No, it was me.

1027
01:11:35,993 --> 01:11:38,302
You leave and leave me alone.

1028
01:11:48,313 --> 01:11:50,383
Get Ellys phone from Amir.

1029
01:11:52,033 --> 01:11:53,182
Amir ...

1030
01:11:54,673 --> 01:11:56,231
Give me Ellys phone please.

1031
01:11:59,913 --> 01:12:00,868
Thank you.

1032
01:12:06,873 --> 01:12:08,750
How can i unlock it?

1033
01:12:08,953 --> 01:12:11,865
Call one of the numbers.

1034
01:12:12,073 --> 01:12:15,190
What time did I go out
with her the other night?

1035
01:12:16,153 --> 01:12:18,109
About ten o'clock I think.

1036
01:12:18,833 --> 01:12:22,110
She received a call, she rejected
saying she would call back.

1037
01:12:22,313 --> 01:12:25,191
Call this number then
and tell the truth.

1038
01:12:25,393 --> 01:12:27,430
I think we should stay, too

1039
01:12:27,953 --> 01:12:31,468
If her family comes here and sees 4 guys,
isn't it weird?

1040
01:12:31,673 --> 01:12:33,823
Her mother was already very suspicious.

1041
01:12:34,033 --> 01:12:36,866
I thought no one answered?

1042
01:12:37,633 --> 01:12:39,988
Wait for me. I'll call.

1043
01:12:40,193 --> 01:12:41,831
We'll see what happens.

1044
01:12:43,313 --> 01:12:45,622
Have you spoken to her mother?

1045
01:12:46,353 --> 01:12:48,913
She didn't even know Elly
came on this trip.

1046
01:12:51,553 --> 01:12:52,429
Come Manoochehr.

1047
01:12:52,633 --> 01:12:55,022
- Where are the keys?
- On the car.

1048
01:12:56,473 --> 01:12:58,225
The car.

1049
01:13:00,833 --> 01:13:02,505
What a strange girl.

1050
01:13:02,713 --> 01:13:04,510
How did we find her phone?

1051
01:13:04,713 --> 01:13:06,112
In Sepideh's bag.

1052
01:13:06,513 --> 01:13:10,950
Naazy was looking for pills
and  found it.

1053
01:13:19,034 --> 01:13:20,466
Wait, Ahmad.

1054
01:13:28,033 --> 01:13:29,102
Where are you going?

1055
01:13:29,313 --> 01:13:31,225
- Making a phone call.
- Who?

1056
01:13:31,433 --> 01:13:33,230
The Number that
called the other night.

1057
01:13:33,433 --> 01:13:35,993
- I come with you.
- You know your husband ...

1058
01:13:36,193 --> 01:13:36,943
I come.

1059
01:13:37,153 --> 01:13:38,950
I call and I'll be back.

1060
01:13:39,194 --> 01:13:40,342
Mom, I'm coming too.

1061
01:13:41,073 --> 01:13:41,870
Ahmad ...

1062
01:13:42,674 --> 01:13:43,992
Go alone.

1063
01:13:53,753 --> 01:13:55,870
Shohreh told me to watch
the Children.

1064
01:13:59,274 --> 01:14:01,788
Do you remember the pantomime game?

1065
01:14:03,273 --> 01:14:05,265
At one time, Elly said:''Gladiolus.''

1066
01:14:06,033 --> 01:14:10,231
Like a premonition. She felt
what would happen to her.

1067
01:14:12,073 --> 01:14:16,191
All this was written.
Nobody is responsible.

1068
01:14:16,393 --> 01:14:18,305
I had a dream.

1069
01:14:18,514 --> 01:14:19,424
What dream?

1070
01:14:19,873 --> 01:14:21,307
A nightmare.

1071
01:14:22,794 --> 01:14:25,467
I can't forget it.

1072
01:14:27,434 --> 01:14:28,582
Shall we turn around?

1073
01:14:29,433 --> 01:14:31,390
No. Drive a little more.

1074
01:15:02,314 --> 01:15:03,713
- She hasn't returned?
- No.

1075
01:15:05,634 --> 01:15:06,828
Who did you talk to?

1076
01:15:07,314 --> 01:15:09,464
- Her brother.
- You told her?

1077
01:15:09,753 --> 01:15:11,949
I described Elly.

1078
01:15:12,153 --> 01:15:15,907
I said
I found his number on her Phone.

1079
01:15:16,114 --> 01:15:19,868
If he knows where
she is.

1080
01:15:20,073 --> 01:15:21,473
He was surprised that
I have her phone.

1081
01:15:21,674 --> 01:15:25,986
I asked what their relationship was.
He said he was her brother.

1082
01:15:26,193 --> 01:15:29,026
But he doesn't know where she is.

1083
01:15:29,753 --> 01:15:31,346
I had to tell him the truth.

1084
01:15:31,954 --> 01:15:34,309
- You said that she drowned?
- No, I couldn't.

1085
01:15:36,873 --> 01:15:38,511
I said we had an
accident here in the north.

1086
01:15:38,714 --> 01:15:40,226
and that she was in the hospital.

1087
01:15:40,714 --> 01:15:42,829
He was surprised
that she is in the north.

1088
01:15:43,194 --> 01:15:44,388
She didn't tell her family.

1089
01:15:46,433 --> 01:15:48,993
That's why
she wanted to return so eagerly.

1090
01:15:49,274 --> 01:15:50,992
And now he comes here?

1091
01:15:51,194 --> 01:15:52,626
Yes, he will.

1092
01:15:52,834 --> 01:15:55,587
He arrives around 16h to Chalous.

1093
01:15:57,274 --> 01:15:58,946
How are we gonna tell him?

1094
01:16:00,154 --> 01:16:02,109
We have to somehow.

1095
01:16:03,274 --> 01:16:05,185
One woman has to come with us.

1096
01:16:06,354 --> 01:16:08,788
- A women has to come.
- What?

1097
01:16:09,314 --> 01:16:11,145
One of you must go.

1098
01:16:21,594 --> 01:16:24,392
Stop, Ahmad. I feel bad.

1099
01:16:26,834 --> 01:16:28,313
You haven't eaten anything.

1100
01:16:32,914 --> 01:16:34,632
Do you need anything?

1101
01:16:49,514 --> 01:16:51,470
Should i take Naazy instead?

1102
01:16:55,954 --> 01:16:57,353
It's not his brother.

1103
01:16:59,033 --> 01:17:00,262
Who?

1104
01:17:01,194 --> 01:17:03,469
One who is coming.

1105
01:17:05,874 --> 01:17:09,753
She told me
she was an only child.

1106
01:17:12,434 --> 01:17:14,072
So who is this guy?

1107
01:17:19,194 --> 01:17:21,344
I think ... her fiance.

1108
01:17:25,834 --> 01:17:27,108
Who's finace?

1109
01:17:28,874 --> 01:17:29,943
Elly's.

1110
01:17:35,474 --> 01:17:37,908
What you're saying, Sepideh?

1111
01:17:39,714 --> 01:17:40,829
She was engaged?

1112
01:17:45,074 --> 01:17:47,145
What have you done?

1113
01:17:48,915 --> 01:17:50,427
What have you done?

1114
01:17:53,874 --> 01:17:57,833
If you knew she was engaged,
why did you introduce her to me?

1115
01:17:58,154 --> 01:18:01,624
She wanted to break up.
She tried for 6 months.

1116
01:18:02,794 --> 01:18:04,546
The guy won't leave her.

1117
01:18:05,874 --> 01:18:07,228
Oh God ...

1118
01:18:09,514 --> 01:18:10,789
Oh God ...

1119
01:18:11,715 --> 01:18:14,865
I had hidden her phone
so noone could call him.

1120
01:18:43,554 --> 01:18:44,703
Is that him?

1121
01:18:45,074 --> 01:18:46,507
The one with the bag?

1122
01:18:47,714 --> 01:18:48,703
I don't know.

1123
01:18:55,475 --> 01:18:57,147
Hello, how are you?

1124
01:18:57,474 --> 01:18:58,988
You've arrived?

1125
01:19:00,114 --> 01:19:02,504
We are on the spot.

1126
01:19:02,834 --> 01:19:06,383
In front of the surgical clinic.

1127
01:19:06,594 --> 01:19:07,424
Imam Reza.

1128
01:19:07,635 --> 01:19:09,546
The Clinique Imam Reza.

1129
01:19:10,954 --> 01:19:13,548
Where? A green sedan?

1130
01:19:14,515 --> 01:19:16,506
I don't see it.

1131
01:19:19,835 --> 01:19:23,110
On the other side of the bridge?
At the entrance to the ring ...

1132
01:19:23,435 --> 01:19:26,188
Yes, very well.
I'll be right there.

1133
01:19:26,394 --> 01:19:29,784
We have a Patrol.
Well, see you soon.

1134
01:19:30,034 --> 01:19:32,026
- He came by car?
- Yes.

1135
01:19:33,835 --> 01:19:35,791
- You drive back with him.
- No.

1136
01:19:35,994 --> 01:19:37,394
We have no choice.

1137
01:19:37,595 --> 01:19:40,267
I ave to drive ahead
and warn the others.

1138
01:19:51,275 --> 01:19:53,835
He doesn't know, that we
know he is her fiance.

1139
01:19:54,035 --> 01:19:54,672
Okay.

1140
01:19:54,875 --> 01:19:57,024
I drive and tell the others.
You drive with him.

1141
01:19:57,234 --> 01:19:59,430
- Be very careful.
- I know.

1142
01:20:06,594 --> 01:20:07,390
Good day.

1143
01:20:08,035 --> 01:20:09,149
- Are you Ali reza?
- Yes.

1144
01:20:09,354 --> 01:20:11,231
Ahmad. Delighted.

1145
01:20:11,435 --> 01:20:13,312
Have you been here long?

1146
01:20:13,515 --> 01:20:14,994
Did you have the accindent?

1147
01:20:15,594 --> 01:20:17,312
No, one of our friends.

1148
01:20:17,515 --> 01:20:19,346
In which Hospital is she?

1149
01:20:19,555 --> 01:20:21,307
- We takes you there.
- How is she?

1150
01:20:21,514 --> 01:20:24,507
- We better hurry.
- Go ..

1151
01:20:24,914 --> 01:20:26,063
Could you give me her phone?

1152
01:20:26,275 --> 01:20:27,627
It is at the villa.

1153
01:20:27,834 --> 01:20:28,824
Tell me about ...

1154
01:20:29,035 --> 01:20:31,868
I'll tell you.
Ahmad, you go.

1155
01:20:32,074 --> 01:20:33,349
I tell you.

1156
01:20:34,594 --> 01:20:35,663
Where do we go?

1157
01:20:37,194 --> 01:20:39,071
We take the bypass.

1158
01:20:39,275 --> 01:20:40,832
Please talk to me.

1159
01:20:42,315 --> 01:20:43,225
We told you on the phone.

1160
01:20:44,314 --> 01:20:45,464
Is she alive?

1161
01:20:48,315 --> 01:20:51,625
Yes, but she's not doing good.

1162
01:20:54,475 --> 01:20:55,954
She is in a coma.

1163
01:20:56,235 --> 01:20:58,112
Oh, my God!

1164
01:20:58,515 --> 01:21:02,474
She was not supposed to come here.
When was the accident?

1165
01:21:02,835 --> 01:21:04,314
We talk on the road.

1166
01:21:04,514 --> 01:21:07,473
Madam, stop confusing me.

1167
01:21:07,755 --> 01:21:09,268
You've seen her papers.

1168
01:21:09,915 --> 01:21:11,427
What is her name?

1169
01:21:12,555 --> 01:21:13,749
Elly.

1170
01:21:16,714 --> 01:21:18,511
Elly appears
on her papers?

1171
01:21:20,795 --> 01:21:23,832
Elly is the teacher of my daughter.

1172
01:21:24,355 --> 01:21:26,310
We did not want to scare you.

1173
01:21:26,515 --> 01:21:28,982
She came with us
for the weekend and...

1174
01:21:29,635 --> 01:21:30,545
What are you waiting here?

1175
01:21:30,754 --> 01:21:32,347
And the story of the accident?

1176
01:21:32,555 --> 01:21:35,149
I'm sorry. Let's go.

1177
01:21:35,355 --> 01:21:38,074
What is it?

1178
01:21:39,115 --> 01:21:40,263
I'm not on my plate ...

1179
01:21:40,475 --> 01:21:42,784
- Me neither.
- Keep your donkey mouth shut.

1180
01:21:43,754 --> 01:21:47,031
- Go away mister!
- Shut up!

1181
01:21:52,395 --> 01:21:55,114
Hi, Ahmad!

1182
01:22:00,955 --> 01:22:02,513
Good morning.

1183
01:22:06,915 --> 01:22:07,791
Amir!

1184
01:22:08,115 --> 01:22:09,468
Peyman, Shohreh!

1185
01:22:09,675 --> 01:22:10,710
Where is Amir?

1186
01:22:10,914 --> 01:22:12,030
Come Naazy, quickly.

1187
01:22:13,475 --> 01:22:15,272
Peyman, come.

1188
01:22:17,995 --> 01:22:19,064
So, Ahmad?

1189
01:22:19,595 --> 01:22:20,948
Hurry, Amir.

1190
01:22:21,155 --> 01:22:22,065
Come all.

1191
01:22:25,515 --> 01:22:27,551
Hurry. he is coming.

1192
01:22:27,755 --> 01:22:29,029
You told him?

1193
01:22:29,275 --> 01:22:30,947
He is not her brother.

1194
01:22:31,315 --> 01:22:32,304
It is her fiance.

1195
01:22:33,715 --> 01:22:35,228
She has a fiance?

1196
01:22:35,436 --> 01:22:36,470
Damn!

1197
01:22:36,675 --> 01:22:37,630
What does that mean?

1198
01:22:37,835 --> 01:22:41,874
The bottom line is that he believes
we are not aware.

1199
01:22:42,715 --> 01:22:45,309
She came here
she dragged with you,

1200
01:22:45,515 --> 01:22:47,153
and is engaged?

1201
01:22:47,355 --> 01:22:48,913
Pity, Peyman, now is not the time.

1202
01:22:49,915 --> 01:22:50,904
How did you know?

1203
01:22:51,115 --> 01:22:53,310
One of her girlfriends
called on her cellphone.

1204
01:22:53,875 --> 01:22:57,106
I told her about the accident

1205
01:22:57,316 --> 01:22:58,828
and the arrival of her brother.

1206
01:23:00,475 --> 01:23:02,386
She told me Elly
was an only daughter.

1207
01:23:02,596 --> 01:23:04,870
I asked who this man was.

1208
01:23:05,315 --> 01:23:07,510
Probably her fiance''''
she said.

1209
01:23:07,755 --> 01:23:10,588
Why did she come with us
if she is engaged?

1210
01:23:11,115 --> 01:23:13,231
She didn't look like
such a person.

1211
01:23:13,435 --> 01:23:15,869
She did.
It's just us who are ...

1212
01:23:16,675 --> 01:23:17,903
naive.

1213
01:23:18,955 --> 01:23:23,107
So, if it is,
she did not drown.

1214
01:23:23,315 --> 01:23:24,794
Maybe she really just left.

1215
01:23:24,995 --> 01:23:28,750
If this guys finds out
why we brought his bride here,

1216
01:23:28,955 --> 01:23:30,548
we are in big trouble.

1217
01:23:30,755 --> 01:23:32,235
Now what?

1218
01:23:32,435 --> 01:23:35,029
We pretend to know nothing.

1219
01:23:35,435 --> 01:23:40,270
He is the brother.
Elly is the teacher of Morvarid.

1220
01:23:40,475 --> 01:23:42,147
The childs wanted Elly
to come with us.

1221
01:23:42,355 --> 01:23:43,709
She agreed. That's it.

1222
01:23:44,035 --> 01:23:47,072
I beg you
get a grip of yourself.

1223
01:23:47,276 --> 01:23:49,914
What if Elly hasn't drowned?

1224
01:23:50,435 --> 01:23:51,505
I don't know ...

1225
01:23:51,715 --> 01:23:53,068
Where is Sepideh?

1226
01:23:54,915 --> 01:23:55,826
They drive together.

1227
01:23:56,115 --> 01:23:57,514
She is aware of everything?

1228
01:23:57,716 --> 01:23:59,626
Yes, I told her.

1229
01:24:00,236 --> 01:24:02,830
She is supposed to
tell him about the drowning.

1230
01:24:03,036 --> 01:24:05,993
What an actresses makes us all
going crazy!

1231
01:24:07,196 --> 01:24:09,504
I have to warn the children.

1232
01:24:09,715 --> 01:24:11,273
Where are they?

1233
01:24:11,756 --> 01:24:13,268
Arash ... Morvarid ...

1234
01:24:20,675 --> 01:24:24,224
Children, come here.
Listen to me.

1235
01:24:25,235 --> 01:24:27,306
You know why Elly
came here with us?

1236
01:24:27,516 --> 01:24:31,110
To watch me
not to go in the water.

1237
01:24:31,315 --> 01:24:33,546
- Bravo that's good.
- But no.

1238
01:24:33,755 --> 01:24:35,269
- Why then?
- Can i say?

1239
01:24:35,475 --> 01:24:37,865
She came to fall in love with you.

1240
01:24:39,115 --> 01:24:40,230
Me?

1241
01:24:40,835 --> 01:24:42,063
Who told you that?

1242
01:24:42,276 --> 01:24:43,390
I saw myself.

1243
01:24:43,595 --> 01:24:46,268
No, you're wrong.
It was a joke, all that.

1244
01:24:46,475 --> 01:24:47,591
Did you hear that, honey?

1245
01:24:47,795 --> 01:24:51,424
That's why she was sad
and she left.

1246
01:24:51,635 --> 01:24:53,752
No, my heart,
she was not sad.

1247
01:24:53,955 --> 01:24:57,028
She wanted to save Arash
and she drowned.

1248
01:24:57,236 --> 01:24:58,554
She is still in the water?

1249
01:24:58,756 --> 01:25:01,064
Morvarid listen. You too.

1250
01:25:01,436 --> 01:25:03,949
Elly's brother is coming here, ok?

1251
01:25:05,756 --> 01:25:08,589
It is a very serious
and is angry man.

1252
01:25:08,795 --> 01:25:10,354
You have to promise me.

1253
01:25:11,116 --> 01:25:13,185
Kids you have to promise...

1254
01:25:13,395 --> 01:25:18,594
not to tell about
our jokes.

1255
01:25:18,836 --> 01:25:21,144
- What jokes?
- Those mentioned by Arash.

1256
01:25:21,355 --> 01:25:23,586
When we played,
we danced, we laughed.

1257
01:25:23,795 --> 01:25:25,354
We used to play pantomime.

1258
01:25:25,555 --> 01:25:28,468
Don't say anything.

1259
01:25:28,676 --> 01:25:32,351
If he asks a questions,
you say:''We do not know.''

1260
01:25:32,555 --> 01:25:33,989
-''We do not know.''
- Bravo.

1261
01:25:34,195 --> 01:25:35,992
Can you say that too Anita?
Good.

1262
01:26:17,716 --> 01:26:19,354
Did she tell him?

1263
01:26:23,596 --> 01:26:24,665
Don't go out.

1264
01:26:25,075 --> 01:26:27,351
Wait on a sign of Sepideh.

1265
01:27:02,476 --> 01:27:03,955
Come in.

1266
01:27:04,876 --> 01:27:05,626
No, okay.

1267
01:27:16,396 --> 01:27:17,795
Where did it happen?

1268
01:27:21,556 --> 01:27:22,874
There.

1269
01:28:01,076 --> 01:28:03,988
- Come, go.
- I want to be alone for a moment.

1270
01:28:38,876 --> 01:28:40,946
What a quiet guy.

1271
01:28:41,916 --> 01:28:44,430
I swear he knows.

1272
01:28:44,996 --> 01:28:47,510
There must be
a reason for everything.

1273
01:28:48,476 --> 01:28:49,829
Shhh! Here he comes.

1274
01:29:24,316 --> 01:29:25,715
Do you a sedative?

1275
01:29:25,916 --> 01:29:27,315
No. Toilets?

1276
01:29:29,476 --> 01:29:30,226
This way.

1277
01:29:48,117 --> 01:29:49,629
- Thank you.
- I beg you.

1278
01:30:21,796 --> 01:30:23,354
Did he tell her parents?

1279
01:30:25,877 --> 01:30:27,150
Not yet.

1280
01:30:28,517 --> 01:30:30,155
Elly didn't tell you about him?

1281
01:30:32,396 --> 01:30:33,272
Amir!

1282
01:30:57,917 --> 01:30:59,828
Shohreh, you have a towel?

1283
01:31:00,037 --> 01:31:03,393
No, thank you.
Can i be alone somewhere?

1284
01:31:03,596 --> 01:31:04,950
This way.

1285
01:31:05,837 --> 01:31:07,315
Go ahead. I beg you.

1286
01:31:11,317 --> 01:31:13,352
Could you bring him a clean bedcover?

1287
01:32:05,997 --> 01:32:07,714
There is no connection here.

1288
01:32:11,277 --> 01:32:14,110
But I talked to her the other night.

1289
01:32:14,877 --> 01:32:16,913
Must have been
when she was out.

1290
01:32:23,117 --> 01:32:24,152
Excuse me ...

1291
01:32:25,717 --> 01:32:26,991
just a second.

1292
01:32:32,437 --> 01:32:34,393
Did she talk about me?

1293
01:32:36,516 --> 01:32:40,749
Yes, she talked a lot about you
and her parents.

1294
01:32:40,957 --> 01:32:42,436
What did she say?

1295
01:32:43,237 --> 01:32:46,195
That she misses you very much.

1296
01:32:46,637 --> 01:32:48,706
She spoke well of you.

1297
01:32:48,957 --> 01:32:50,709
She was worried for her mother.

1298
01:32:50,917 --> 01:32:54,909
I think her mother ... your mother
is a heart patient?

1299
01:33:06,757 --> 01:33:07,792
Naazy ...

1300
01:33:08,837 --> 01:33:10,475
- Sorry.
- Are you coming?

1301
01:33:25,197 --> 01:33:28,428
It's not his brother. Why do
you she missed him?

1302
01:33:28,797 --> 01:33:30,116
She spoke well of him?

1303
01:33:30,437 --> 01:33:31,870
I didn't know what to say.

1304
01:33:32,317 --> 01:33:33,545
Did he suspect anything?

1305
01:33:33,757 --> 01:33:35,315
No ... I do not know.

1306
01:33:56,597 --> 01:33:58,189
Don't you want to eat anything?

1307
01:34:00,957 --> 01:34:04,074
I just have to make a
call to Tehran.

1308
01:34:04,277 --> 01:34:06,633
- I accompany you.
- Okay.

1309
01:34:30,997 --> 01:34:35,627
You can leave the bed of the
newlyweds, I'll take it.

1310
01:34:36,077 --> 01:34:37,306
Thank you.

1311
01:34:41,237 --> 01:34:44,991
Her poor husband was there this morning
but I did not want to bother him.

1312
01:34:45,717 --> 01:34:48,106
- The husband of who?
- From the drowned.

1313
01:34:49,997 --> 01:34:51,635
Her husband was here this morning?

1314
01:34:59,557 --> 01:35:01,388
Madam, could you come here please?

1315
01:35:04,438 --> 01:35:05,348
Peyman!

1316
01:35:06,677 --> 01:35:07,427
He knows!

1317
01:35:10,157 --> 01:35:12,149
The old woman told him.

1318
01:35:12,757 --> 01:35:15,066
She said that the bed
was for Elly and her husband.

1319
01:35:15,277 --> 01:35:16,506
Damn!

1320
01:35:17,358 --> 01:35:18,676
Damn!

1321
01:35:19,958 --> 01:35:20,753
Where is he?

1322
01:35:21,078 --> 01:35:22,226
I guess he is coming.

1323
01:35:25,597 --> 01:35:27,315
Do something.

1324
01:35:27,517 --> 01:35:28,712
There's nothing more to do.

1325
01:35:28,958 --> 01:35:30,151
We have to say the truth.

1326
01:35:30,357 --> 01:35:31,632
We wanted to pair his wife
with someone?

1327
01:35:31,837 --> 01:35:33,112
We didn't know.

1328
01:35:33,557 --> 01:35:35,992
It is true that we knew nothing.

1329
01:35:36,317 --> 01:35:38,468
The best thing is to tell the truth.

1330
01:35:39,957 --> 01:35:40,787
But say what?

1331
01:35:40,998 --> 01:35:42,750
She didn't tell us
she was engaged.

1332
01:35:42,958 --> 01:35:45,994
Otherwise, we would never
present her to Ahmad.

1333
01:35:46,198 --> 01:35:47,869
Don't tell about Ahmad.

1334
01:35:48,118 --> 01:35:49,232
What else should we say then?

1335
01:35:49,678 --> 01:35:51,872
Among the cops
we'll have to confess everything.

1336
01:35:52,077 --> 01:35:54,034
Does he know she came
for Ahmad?

1337
01:35:54,717 --> 01:35:56,628
He is not stupid. He understood.

1338
01:35:56,838 --> 01:35:59,795
He was suspicious before coming.

1339
01:36:00,478 --> 01:36:03,038
Why does he pretend
to be her brother?

1340
01:36:04,317 --> 01:36:05,955
- We tell him everything.
- No, I beg you.

1341
01:36:06,157 --> 01:36:08,353
So what, Sepideh, lying?

1342
01:36:09,437 --> 01:36:10,951
We can't.

1343
01:36:11,157 --> 01:36:12,351
He knows anyway.

1344
01:36:12,638 --> 01:36:14,912
We have no choice, Sepideh.

1345
01:36:15,278 --> 01:36:18,155
- He will find out.
- Elly will be dishonored.

1346
01:36:18,357 --> 01:36:19,757
We dishonor her?

1347
01:36:19,957 --> 01:36:20,707
I respect the dead

1348
01:36:20,917 --> 01:36:23,431
but an engaged woman
looking for a husband.

1349
01:36:23,637 --> 01:36:24,547
This means:

1350
01:36:24,758 --> 01:36:26,315
1, she fooled us all,

1351
01:36:26,518 --> 01:36:28,190
2, she fooled her fiance.

1352
01:36:28,717 --> 01:36:29,752
Fooled?

1353
01:36:29,958 --> 01:36:32,994
Obviously.
If you, you have a boyfriend

1354
01:36:33,197 --> 01:36:35,587
and your boyfriend
finds a girl better than you

1355
01:36:35,797 --> 01:36:37,311
for the weekend,
to play volleyball ...

1356
01:36:37,517 --> 01:36:38,746
Where's the harm?

1357
01:36:38,958 --> 01:36:39,992
You don't understand.

1358
01:36:40,197 --> 01:36:42,587
From our point of view,
there is no harm.

1359
01:36:42,837 --> 01:36:45,476
Put yourself in the position of the boy,
and everything is evil.

1360
01:36:45,878 --> 01:36:47,470
From the money she has given

1361
01:36:47,917 --> 01:36:49,476
to cleaning and staying here!

1362
01:36:49,958 --> 01:36:52,074
That was all a show she played for us!

1363
01:36:52,277 --> 01:36:53,870
We must decide now.

1364
01:36:55,638 --> 01:36:57,469
She gave up that nice boy.

1365
01:36:57,677 --> 01:36:59,987
I was ashamed of myself
when i saw him.

1366
01:37:00,758 --> 01:37:02,714
The the noise i made the other night ...

1367
01:37:02,917 --> 01:37:03,827
Hurry.

1368
01:37:04,038 --> 01:37:06,711
Ahmad, tell him
we thought she was single.

1369
01:37:06,918 --> 01:37:08,397
She lied to us.

1370
01:37:08,758 --> 01:37:10,396
- We say the truth.
- Please don't.

1371
01:37:10,717 --> 01:37:12,993
We lie to him
to save the honor of Elly?

1372
01:37:13,198 --> 01:37:15,233
The dead have no need of honor.

1373
01:37:16,077 --> 01:37:17,431
- I won't let it happen.
- Too late.

1374
01:37:18,557 --> 01:37:21,026
- Ahmad, don't let them ...
- Peyman come here.

1375
01:37:40,958 --> 01:37:43,232
I knew it.

1376
01:37:43,438 --> 01:37:44,427
She had told me.

1377
01:37:46,198 --> 01:37:48,472
I swear.
I'm not lying this time.

1378
01:37:49,038 --> 01:37:50,391
On the head of my daughter.

1379
01:37:50,758 --> 01:37:53,795
I told Ahmad
he was her fiance.

1380
01:37:56,358 --> 01:37:58,075
Ahmad, why don't you tell them?

1381
01:37:58,398 --> 01:38:00,309
There is nothing more to say.

1382
01:38:01,278 --> 01:38:02,472
I told her

1383
01:38:02,678 --> 01:38:05,828
a friend arrived from Germany
and I was asked ...

1384
01:38:07,677 --> 01:38:10,067
to submit a woman.

1385
01:38:10,998 --> 01:38:13,671
She said she doesn't want
to get married.

1386
01:38:13,878 --> 01:38:17,666
That she has a fiance for 2 years
and wants to break up.

1387
01:38:17,878 --> 01:38:20,392
She didn't love him.
He made her suffer.

1388
01:38:20,598 --> 01:38:25,467
Her family are against it,
and he also wouldn't let her go.

1389
01:38:26,598 --> 01:38:30,876
I offered her to meet our
friend Ahmad during his brief stay.

1390
01:38:31,078 --> 01:38:33,638
She said no,  not
until i haven't broken up.

1391
01:38:33,838 --> 01:38:37,717
I sent Ahmad a photo of her,
and he liked her.

1392
01:38:37,918 --> 01:38:40,478
So, I insisted her to come.

1393
01:38:44,958 --> 01:38:49,236
And she said ...?
She was determined to break.

1394
01:38:49,918 --> 01:38:53,797
I told her, if my friend
won't return to Iran anytime soon.

1395
01:38:54,238 --> 01:38:56,798
You should meet him just once.

1396
01:38:57,078 --> 01:38:58,397
She still refused.

1397
01:38:58,598 --> 01:39:02,591
Finally, she agreed
provided that it remains a secret

1398
01:39:02,958 --> 01:39:04,789
and just for one night.

1399
01:39:05,238 --> 01:39:06,876
She had told me.

1400
01:39:12,638 --> 01:39:14,515
You insisted her to come.

1401
01:39:15,078 --> 01:39:16,751
But she wasn't forced to come?

1402
01:39:16,958 --> 01:39:21,395
I begged.
I said that I had everything planned.

1403
01:39:22,518 --> 01:39:23,268
My God!

1404
01:39:25,758 --> 01:39:27,714
We can at least save her honor.

1405
01:39:29,278 --> 01:39:33,635
If we say we really didn't know
she had a fiance

1406
01:39:33,838 --> 01:39:34,873
would he believe that?

1407
01:39:35,078 --> 01:39:36,113
Who would believe that?

1408
01:39:36,318 --> 01:39:38,878
What does it change
if he believes it?

1409
01:39:39,198 --> 01:39:42,713
Anyway,
she did wrong by coming here.

1410
01:39:43,158 --> 01:39:44,386
But I insisted.

1411
01:39:45,198 --> 01:39:45,948
It's not a reason.

1412
01:39:46,198 --> 01:39:49,395
Tell the truth.
You say you didn't know.

1413
01:39:49,598 --> 01:39:51,749
Me, I say that I knew.

1414
01:39:52,078 --> 01:39:55,991
Everything is my fault.
Come what may.

1415
01:39:56,358 --> 01:39:59,031
You're unconscious!
He'll lynch you!

1416
01:39:59,398 --> 01:40:00,148
Too bad.

1417
01:40:00,358 --> 01:40:03,555
And then he sees us as a whole.

1418
01:40:03,758 --> 01:40:06,592
To him we are all acomplices.

1419
01:40:06,838 --> 01:40:09,716
Amir, do something.
I can't take it anymore.

1420
01:40:09,918 --> 01:40:12,148
Sepideh, just listen
for once in your life.

1421
01:40:12,358 --> 01:40:16,067
It is more than you and me.
We should all be together.

1422
01:40:16,998 --> 01:40:17,794
Ahmad

1423
01:40:18,318 --> 01:40:19,718
What do you think?

1424
01:40:22,758 --> 01:40:23,873
We tell him.

1425
01:40:24,478 --> 01:40:25,706
We say the truth.

1426
01:40:25,919 --> 01:40:27,067
Ok.

1427
01:40:27,599 --> 01:40:29,077
And you, Manoochehr?

1428
01:40:29,758 --> 01:40:31,828
We really didn't know
she was engaged.

1429
01:40:32,039 --> 01:40:34,074
Now we learned too late.

1430
01:40:38,518 --> 01:40:39,747
And you, Shohreh?

1431
01:40:40,358 --> 01:40:43,634
I have not the heart
to lie to this poor boy.

1432
01:40:44,558 --> 01:40:46,038
And you, Naazy?

1433
01:40:47,679 --> 01:40:48,952
I bow to the majority.

1434
01:40:49,158 --> 01:40:51,672
The majority seems to go
for the truth.

1435
01:40:52,119 --> 01:40:53,837
We were not aware.

1436
01:40:54,038 --> 01:40:55,153
Me, I was.

1437
01:40:55,358 --> 01:40:57,997
But you're alone.
And you just told us a minute ago!

1438
01:40:58,518 --> 01:40:59,394
He is coming.

1439
01:41:01,278 --> 01:41:03,838
Come, let's go together.

1440
01:41:04,638 --> 01:41:05,832
Peyman, watch out.

1441
01:41:06,678 --> 01:41:08,191
And the children? Arash?

1442
01:41:08,839 --> 01:41:11,512
Stay here, Sepideh.
Come Naazy.

1443
01:41:12,598 --> 01:41:15,476
Please don't make the
situation any worse.

1444
01:41:16,759 --> 01:41:18,714
What will he think about Elly?

1445
01:41:19,399 --> 01:41:21,593
Arash, Anita,

1446
01:41:22,679 --> 01:41:24,191
Morvarid, come quickly.

1447
01:41:46,078 --> 01:41:46,908
Ahmad!

1448
01:41:51,958 --> 01:41:52,993
Let me see, Ahmad!

1449
01:41:56,119 --> 01:41:56,915
Asshole!

1450
01:41:57,118 --> 01:41:58,711
Raise your head.

1451
01:41:59,639 --> 01:42:00,707
You are bleeding ...

1452
01:42:05,479 --> 01:42:09,028
I can put my hand on the Quran

1453
01:42:09,239 --> 01:42:12,196
to swear that we are telling the truth!

1454
01:42:13,198 --> 01:42:14,870
On the life of my children!

1455
01:42:15,079 --> 01:42:16,194
Dear Sir

1456
01:42:16,398 --> 01:42:18,037
there was no reason to lie to you.

1457
01:42:18,238 --> 01:42:20,469
We came here with our families.

1458
01:42:20,679 --> 01:42:22,112
We did not organize
a meeting

1459
01:42:22,319 --> 01:42:24,674
between your fiance and our friend.

1460
01:42:24,879 --> 01:42:26,392
We're not crazy!

1461
01:42:26,599 --> 01:42:29,795
If we had had the slightest suspicion,
we would not permit.

1462
01:42:29,999 --> 01:42:31,955
What is this discussion?

1463
01:42:32,158 --> 01:42:33,387
- Lets go sit down.
- You shut up!

1464
01:42:33,599 --> 01:42:34,714
Shut up, asshole!

1465
01:42:34,958 --> 01:42:36,950
- Stop!
- Go back, Ahmad!

1466
01:42:37,199 --> 01:42:38,313
That's enough!

1467
01:42:39,599 --> 01:42:41,793
We suffer for
two days!

1468
01:42:42,399 --> 01:42:43,957
No one has eaten for 2 days!

1469
01:42:44,678 --> 01:42:45,714
I ask!

1470
01:42:46,799 --> 01:42:48,596
I just want to
be told the truth!

1471
01:42:48,798 --> 01:42:52,030
I proposed to call the police.
You will see the report.

1472
01:42:52,239 --> 01:42:54,229
To hell with the police.

1473
01:42:54,559 --> 01:42:58,268
We can not lie to the police.
This will be a proof.

1474
01:42:58,478 --> 01:42:59,673
I don't want it!

1475
01:42:59,879 --> 01:43:01,277
It's the law, sir!

1476
01:43:01,479 --> 01:43:03,595
- Am i talking to you?
- Do you mind!

1477
01:43:03,798 --> 01:43:06,029
Come here, Shohreh, come.

1478
01:43:13,398 --> 01:43:15,310
Who brought Elly here?

1479
01:43:17,919 --> 01:43:19,034
My wife.

1480
01:43:19,879 --> 01:43:22,347
- She know her from the kids school.
- Where is she?

1481
01:43:23,199 --> 01:43:23,948
Inside.

1482
01:43:24,279 --> 01:43:25,837
I want to talk to her.

1483
01:43:27,279 --> 01:43:29,189
She is very ill.

1484
01:43:29,399 --> 01:43:31,117
Worse than me?

1485
01:43:32,359 --> 01:43:33,189
She sleeps.

1486
01:43:33,399 --> 01:43:35,390
We told you already.

1487
01:43:35,599 --> 01:43:38,067
I have a question to ask.

1488
01:43:38,359 --> 01:43:39,474
We go to the police ...

1489
01:43:39,678 --> 01:43:41,396
We'll go, okay.

1490
01:43:41,719 --> 01:43:44,711
- I want to talk ...
- She just fell asleep.

1491
01:43:44,918 --> 01:43:48,594
Do not be afraid.
I won't get any worse than this!

1492
01:43:54,479 --> 01:43:55,673
Where is she?

1493
01:43:56,359 --> 01:43:57,428
Madam!

1494
01:43:59,719 --> 01:44:00,673
Wait here.

1495
01:44:01,159 --> 01:44:02,148
I'm going.

1496
01:44:02,438 --> 01:44:05,590
Shohreh, call Sepideh.

1497
01:44:08,479 --> 01:44:10,868
I wanna talk to her alone.

1498
01:44:12,759 --> 01:44:13,669
Shohreh!

1499
01:44:26,439 --> 01:44:28,714
He is not guy you
can tell anything to.

1500
01:44:31,919 --> 01:44:34,228
He bashed Ahmad.

1501
01:44:35,799 --> 01:44:37,596
I say this for your own good.

1502
01:44:42,319 --> 01:44:43,832
Please, Sepideh,

1503
01:44:45,919 --> 01:44:46,749
Get up.

1504
01:44:48,159 --> 01:44:50,593
Go wash your face,
I call him in.

1505
01:44:51,400 --> 01:44:52,310
Get up, darling.

1506
01:45:44,239 --> 01:45:46,230
It was you who invited her?

1507
01:45:47,959 --> 01:45:49,597
Yes, it's me.

1508
01:45:54,559 --> 01:45:55,708
Can I sit down?

1509
01:45:55,919 --> 01:45:59,116
When you told her to
come and meet your friend,

1510
01:45:59,319 --> 01:46:00,354
she said nothing?

1511
01:46:05,800 --> 01:46:08,394
Can I say something,
before?

1512
01:46:09,439 --> 01:46:11,589
- Elly ...
- Listen to me.

1513
01:46:13,239 --> 01:46:16,312
I just want to know something ...

1514
01:46:16,799 --> 01:46:17,754
Sit.

1515
01:46:22,639 --> 01:46:24,232
It's yes or no.

1516
01:46:25,479 --> 01:46:27,231
- When she knew ...
- But ...

1517
01:46:28,359 --> 01:46:30,157
... Didn't she say no?

1518
01:46:30,400 --> 01:46:34,028
Didn't she say no?
i can't come, I have a fiance?

1519
01:46:34,239 --> 01:46:35,355
Did she?

1520
01:46:36,839 --> 01:46:38,636
Listen, really ...

1521
01:46:40,040 --> 01:46:42,314
Really, it ...

1522
01:46:42,520 --> 01:46:45,477
For me, it's important.

1523
01:46:45,679 --> 01:46:49,434
I gave her three years of my life.

1524
01:46:49,640 --> 01:46:52,200
You can sit too?

1525
01:47:00,080 --> 01:47:01,718
Didn't she refuse?

1526
01:47:06,439 --> 01:47:07,998
Yes or no?

1527
01:47:10,839 --> 01:47:13,354
No, she did not refuse.

1528
01:48:04,520 --> 01:48:05,669
Alireza,

1529
01:48:06,440 --> 01:48:08,874
the police called.

1530
01:48:09,320 --> 01:48:11,515
They have now found

1531
01:48:13,119 --> 01:48:15,554
the body of a woman in water.

1532
01:48:16,599 --> 01:48:18,636
You have to go identify her.

1533
01:48:21,960 --> 01:48:23,597
They called the house.

1534
01:48:26,959 --> 01:48:27,948
Amir!

1535
01:48:38,600 --> 01:48:39,749
Mr. ...

1536
01:48:41,640 --> 01:48:44,154
Wait, we all come with you.

1537
01:48:53,600 --> 01:48:54,919
You recognize her?

1538
01:49:32,760 --> 01:49:34,273
My condolences.

1539
01:49:45,000 --> 01:49:46,638
I would like my keys.

1540
01:49:48,760 --> 01:49:52,435
Will you
tell the family?

1541
01:49:52,640 --> 01:49:53,834
Do it yourself.

1542
01:49:55,000 --> 01:49:57,275
It would be better if you told them?
